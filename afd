...New AVIATION...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 329 AM PDT Wed Aug 7 2024

Heat Advisory extended to 9 PM this evening as warm temps
continue. A mix of high and mid-level clouds this afternoon
associated with remnant tropical moisture. Cool down still on the
way through the rest of the week.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 329 AM PDT Wed Aug 7 2024

Taking a look at the temperature trend this morning...current
temps are about 3-5 degrees warmer across low elevations and about
10 degrees warmer at higher elevations than 24 hours ago. This
warmer start paired with the overall lack of cloud cover this
morning will lead to another hot day across the interior. Temperatures
today look to be a bit warmer than originally forecast by a few
degrees. Therefore the Heat Advisory was extended to 9 PM this
evening, in effect for the same areas. Highs today will be similar
to yesterday.

.LONG TERM...
(Thursday through Tuesday)
Issued at 329 AM PDT Wed Aug 7 2024

The late week cool down is still in the forecast, but a bit more
gradual through Saturday. No notable change other than the ridge
lingering a bit longer. Ensemble guidance and cluster analysis
still supports a weak upper level ridge digging into the PNW late
this weekend into early next week. This would ultimately lead to
near normal or below normal temperatures.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 442 AM PDT Wed Aug 7 2024

VFR conditions across the board at the moment. The marine layer is
still holding steady around 1,000 ft, but it`s not fully
saturated. The 24 hour trends show warmer and drier air at the
surface, which is keeping the typical morning stratus away. There
is still a small chance for a sunrise surprise, particularly at
the Monterey Bay Terminals. Otherwise moderate onshore winds will
develop in the afternoon as high cloud cover builds. There is a
better chance for IFR stratus tonight as more moisture moves in
from the south.

Vicinity of SFO...It now looks like the SF Bay terminals will
stay VFR through the morning, though there is still a 15% chance
of an IFR ceiling developing in the next 3 or 4 hours. The
standard sea breeze winds are expected this afternoon. Due to
increasing moisture, there is a 60% chance for an IFR ceiling
Thursday morning.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...Challenging forecast here. There has been
a patch of low clouds swirling around the Monterey Bay all night,
but it`s the only patch of low clouds around. The guidance is
split on developing a ceiling later this morning. The satellite
trend hasn`t shown much, and sunrise is quickly approaching so the
TAFs lean optimistic. There will be a better chance tonight-
Thursday morning.

.MARINE...
(Today through Monday)
Issued at 329 AM PDT Wed Aug 7 2024

The gradient between subtropical high pressure over the East
Pacific and lower pressure over California is supporting a fresh
NW breeze with moderate to rough seas across the waters. While
there are no significant changes expected through the forecast
period, this gradient will relax a bit before returning this
weekend.
