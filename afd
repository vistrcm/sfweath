...New AVIATION...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 120 AM PST Sat Jan 20 2024

Rain, moderate to heavy at times, will continue through much of
the weekend and linger into Monday morning. Rises in creeks and
streams are expected as a result of increased rainfall. Isolated
thunderstorms a possibility Monday morning. Another round of light
rain comes about towards the midweek.

&&

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 120 AM PST Sat Jan 20 2024

At this hour, just a few lingering
showers are seen over the ocean, and along the Santa Lucia
mountains. Much of the rain has pushed eastward, currently impacting
our neighbors at NWS Hanford. So, with rain system #1 petering out,
how about a look at some rainfall amounts so far across the area
over the last 12 hours? SF downtown thus far has received 0.22",
Oakland airport 0.12", Petaluma 0.59", Santa Rosa 0.57", San Jose
airport 0.04", Santa Cruz 0.41", Monterey 0.04", and Big Sur 0.76".
No major impacts reported from rain or wind at this hour.

But, that`s not all. More rain is on its way late this afternoon and
into late Sunday and early Monday. Scattered showers are expected to
linger into this afternoon before the next large stratiform region
of precipitation moves inland. So, if you`re planning on getting out
for a walk today, best to do it before the afternoon. Starting in
the late afternoon today, rain becomes more widespread and is
expected to last through the morning of Sunday. Rain with this
system is expected to be generally light to moderate and steady
throughout the night. Not much in the way of heavy rain is expected,
with PWAT values for this system only sitting in the 0.8-0.9" range.
Although this is above the median for KOAK sounding climatology,
which is 0.51", it is far below record max values of 1.79", and only
just flirting with 90th percentile values. With this next system,
rain totals of 0.5-0.75" are possible in the North Bay, 0.25-0.5"
for the greater SF Bay area, 0.25-0.3" or so for Monterey region and
Salinas valley, and up to about 1.5" for the coastal mountains.

What will be more interesting is the final of this series of rain
bands that begins to impact the region late Sunday night and into
early Monday morning. Rain totals of 3-4" are possible in the
coastal mountains, 1.5-2" for the North Bay and SF peninsula, and 1-
1.5" for the East, South, and Monterey Bay, in addition to the
Salinas valley. Heaviest rain is expected to fall in the morning
hours of Monday with rain rates approaching 0.3"/hr in lower
elevations, and potentially up to 0.5"/hr in the coastal mountains.
At the moment, WPC Day 2 ERO outlook has parts of the North Bay
under a slight risk, with the remainder of the CWA under a MRGL
risk. Convection remains a possibility with this system in the early
morning of Monday, however, mid-level lapse rates only suggest
moderate instability at around 6.2 C/km, so thunderstorm chances
remain only slight, and remain greatest over the ocean. SPC Day 3
Outlook has the CA coastline under a general mention for isolated
thunderstorms.

Last but not least, gusty winds are expected with the rain early
Monday morning. Gusts up to 25-30mph are expected briefly with the
fropa out of the south. Winds diminish beyond the morning and the
fropa. No wind advisory needed at this time.

.LONG TERM...
(Monday through Thursday)
Issued at 1135 PM PST Fri Jan 19 2024

A progressive flow pattern will remain in place throughout the
extended period. Showers will be ongoing during the first half of
Monday as upper troughing pulls away from the region. Thereafter
look for transient upper ridging to provide a brief respite from
precipitation on Tuesday. A shortwave trough brings additional
precipitation chances by mid week but amounts appear rather light.
High pressure returns for Friday into the weekend with the best rain
chances shifting north of the region. High temperatures should
remain seasonal and in the 60s with overnight lows on the mild side.
Overnight readings should generally dip into the 40s, with some
lower 50s along the immediate coast and bays.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 345 AM PST Sat Jan 20 2024

Scattered showers are ongoing this morning with a mix of flight
categories. Expect this mix to persist today with periodically
lower ceilings and visibilities initially driven by periodic
showers. Conditions should gradually deteriorate this afternoon
into tomorrow morning as ceilings lower and shower coverage
increases. Winds will be breezy today into tonight with a
southerly component.

Vicinity of SFO...Initially VFR this morning outside of possible
sub-VFR via a rogue shower. Deteriorating conditions later this
afternoon into tonight as ceilings lower and shower coverage
becomes more numerous. Light S-SE winds should increase by early
afternoon and potentially shift from the S-SW for a time before
backing S-SE tonight. However confidence in exact timing of wind
shift is presently low.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...Initially VFR. Trending towards sub-VFR
later this afternoon and evening as ceilings lower and shower
coverage increases. Winds S-SW at KMRY with a more SE component at
KSNS. Increasingly windy at KSNS with gusts to 25 kt expected this
afternoon and again late tonight.

.MARINE...
(Today through Thursday)
Issued at 304 AM PST Sat Jan 20 2024

Breezy southerly winds will persist into tonight before
diminishing. Seas will remain elevated into Sunday morning.
Scattered showers and perhaps a thunderstorm are expected into
Monday morning as multiple rounds of unsettled weather continue.
Winds ease into mid week some some additional light rain expected.

&&

.HYDROLOGY...
Issued at 125 AM PST Sat Jan 20 2024

Scattered showers persist through the morning of Saturday.
Saturday night through Monday morning, more steady rain begins to
fall becoming moderate to heavy Sunday night. Rainfall totals
from today through Monday will range from 1.5 to 3 inches across
most areas with 3 to 5 inches expected over the North Bay. Locally
up to 6 to 8 inches is possible over favored peaks and higher
elevations of the coastal mountain range.

WPC has issued a "Slight" risk for the day 2 ERO over the North
Bay. MRGL outlook extends across the remainder of the CWA for day
2. For day 3, ERO is at marginal across the entirety of the CWA.
As a result of moderate to heavy rainfall at times over the
course of the weekend, rapid rises in creeks and streams remain a
possibility. At this time, only a few small creeks in the North
Bay are expected to reach "action" stage, then returning to normal
levels just beyond the end of the rain. No major flooding
expected.

USGS instrumentation throughout the San Francisco Bay Area indicates
that shallow soils on steep hillsides are approaching saturation.
With more rain incoming to further saturate soils, shallow
landslides across the CWA remain a possibility.
