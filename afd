(Today and tonight)

Full scale warning operations on the watchfloor as the cold front
comes ashore. Several cells over the coastal waters have
displayed rotational velocity of 30kts, indicating a legitimate
waterspout potential. Fortunately the trend has been for these
cells to lose structure as they come ashore, but we can`t rule out
our classic landfalling waterspouts causing some damage along the
coast from San Mateo to Monterey County over the next several
hours. While narrow and fast moving, the main band of rain has
been intense, with a weather spotter in Marin reporting over six
tenths of an inch in less than an hour. These high rain rates
could cause some land slides, especially after the recent wet
weather. This threat is highest over the Pickett Burn Scar, where
a flash flood warning is in effect. Winds have been gusting to
gale force and quickly diminishing after the frontal boundary
passes. In the post frontal environment the rain will transition
to lighter scattered showers and persist through the day on a
decreasing trend before drier weather moves in overnight.

.LONG TERM...
Issued at 1218 AM PST Mon Nov 17 2025
(Tuesday through Sunday)

In the wake of todays exiting system to the south we`ll see
progressive, high amplitude ridging move across central California
Tuesday and Wednesday resulting in drier conditions while
temperatures remain cooler than normal. Tuesday will be mostly sunny
area wide, with gradually increasing cloud cover on Wednesday. The
remainder of the extended forecast lacks consensus for the timing
and evolution of what appears to be a similar type storm system that
we saw overnight and today. Rain chances begin to increase across
the North Bay Wednesday evening, spreading across our whole area
during the day Thursday, and exiting to the south by early Friday
morning. Rainfall totals and winds will not be as strong as we`ve
seen the last 24hrs, however the saturated soils may bring more
risks for land/rock slides. Very high surf looks likely late
Thursday and Friday. Next weekend looks mostly dry attm, with a
signal for another upper level low bringing increasing rain
chances early next week.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 322 AM PST Mon Nov 17 2025

A very difficult forecast for the upcoming TAF period as a surface
low or series of lows moves through the region. The wind pattern, in
particular, depends critically on the strength, location and track
of the low with cyclonic effects expected across the region. In
addition, the current winds are much lighter than what the high
resolution models depicted. Thus, confidence in the wind forecasts
is low to very low, and interests should monitor TAF updates as the
low`s evolution is refined. Ceilings remain generally MVFR to VFR
with mid-level clouds through Monday night at least, some clearing
is possible early Tuesday morning. Chances for showers also persist
through the day with the low pressure moving south. Thunderstorms
remain possible, but confidence in timing or location is too low to
include in the TAFs.

Vicinity of SFO... MVFR to VFR with mid-level ceilings through the
TAF period. Showers and a chance of thunderstorms persist through
the late evening-early overnight period. The winds will be rather
gusty, but very low confidence on wind direction, especially after
3Z as a surface low approaches the terminal.

SFO Bridge Approach... Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals... MVFR ceilings and a chance of showers
through the TAF period. Winds are hard to pin down owing to the
surface low passing through, but expect an

.MARINE...
(Today through Saturday)
Issued at 322 AM PST Mon Nov 17 2025

A cold front moved through the coastal waters overnight bringing
widespread gale force gusts. The winds have since shifted to a
moderate westerly breeze. Winds will continue to shift and
increase to a strong NW breeze through the day, building rough
seas across the coastal waters. Strong winds and rough seas will
persist through Tuesday before conditions improve for a short
window Wednesday through Thursday. A very high WNW swell will
arrive late Thursday into Friday.
