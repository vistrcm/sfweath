.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 320 AM PST Sun Nov 5 2023

A pair of cold fronts will bring periods of light rain to the Bay
Area through Monday night. Clear skies and cold mornings are in
store for the middle of the week before another round of rain late
week.

&&

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 320 AM PST Sun Nov 5 2023

A cold front is analyzed about 200 mi west of San Francisco with a
second front farther in the Pacific. Light rain showers will
follow the first front from north to south through the day. The
overnight rain is lagging behind expectations so far. In fact, we
don`t have much more than a trace reported from any rain gauges as
of 2 AM. Despite the slow start, the expected total accumulation
has only decreased marginally. The majority of the rain will fall
in narrow time windows as the fronts pass today and Monday. This
first front will also act to prime the atmosphere with higher
humidity, helping the second front on Monday bring more rain to
the ground. This high relative humidity will also bring periods
of dense fog to the North Bay Valleys and Monterey Bay area this
morning.

&&

.LONG TERM...
(Monday through Saturday)
Issued at 320 AM PST Sun Nov 5 2023

Monday looks like the wetter day as the second front comes
through. The core of a 145 kt jet max will move directly over the
Bay Area, which could support some stronger showers beneath the
divergent quadrant. The storm total QPF has backed down to 1/4-1/2
inch in the North Bay, about 1/4 inch in San Francisco and the
East Bay, 1/10-1/4 in the South Bay and Monterey Bay area.

A few sprinkles may linger into Tuesday before a short wave ridge
brings dry weather and clear skies for the middle of the week. The
big story then shifts to cold morning temperatures. Clear skies
will enhance nocturnal radiational cooling in addition to the cold
air mass brought in with the earlier cold frontal passage. The
NAM even brings the 1000-500 mb 540 dm line as far south as San
Francisco on Tuesday. Some of the colder inland areas in the North
Bay and Monterey/San Benito could reach freezing on Wednesday and
Thursday morning. Clouds will gradually increase Thursday before
another chance of light rain returns to the forecast Friday. While
the timing of this event could still shift, Saturday looks dry at
the moment.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 403 AM PST Sun Nov 5 2023

Incoming trough will continue to bring a mixed bag of conditions
across the region today and this evening. Current satellite showing
an initial front moving through with high clouds exiting the Bay
Area to the south. As this round of high clouds clears out, expect
low clouds to increase in coverage through the morning hours before
the next wave of shower activity begins. Current guidance suggests
light rain increasing in the North Bay by late morning, spreading
southward across the rest of the region into the overnight hours
tonight/Monday morning. Other than MVFR/IFR cigs, FG will be a
factor particularly for the Monterey Bay area through sunrise. Winds
generally out of the south for the first half of today, gaining more
of a westerly component behind the front this afternoon.

Vicinity of SFO...Confidence in timing of CIGs remains on the lower
end this morning as the front has slowed significantly. -SHRA still
looking likely during the afternoon hours with a mix of MVFR/near-
IFR CIGs through this evening. Winds SE through the morning hours,
becoming more SW through the afternoon.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...Dense FG locked in across much of the
Monterey Bay region with many terminals around 1/4SM VIS or less.
Expect this to last until around sunrise. Rain chances pushed back
until the latter half of the TAF period, and even still uncertain if
much in the way of impactful showers will actually make it as far
south as the Central Coast. Otherwise, winds remain relatively light
with breezy onshore flow this afternoon.

.MARINE...
(Today through Friday)
Issued at 403 AM PST Sun Nov 5 2023

Cold front continues to move over the northern coastal waters
overnight along with bringing chances of rain to the northern
seas. Rain showers will spread southward through today. Another
cold front will approach late Sunday afternoon into early Monday,
bringing more rain showers through Monday morning. West to
northwest swell of 8 to 10 feet will move through the waters
overnight creating possible hazardous conditions for small crafts.
Westerly swell will diminish briefly Sunday into Monday before
building again Monday. Breezy to gusty conditions develop midweek
next week.

&&

.MTR WATCHES/WARNINGS/ADVISORIES...
CA...Dense Fog Advisory until 9 AM PST this morning for CAZ528-530.

PZ...Small Craft Advisory until 8 AM PST this morning for PZZ570.
