...New AVIATION, MARINE...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 1229 AM PST Sat Nov 30 2024

Slight warming trend kicks off today and continues through next
week.

&&

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 1229 AM PST Sat Nov 30 2024

Features that are influencing our weather: high pressure over the
West Coast and a deep upper-level low off the California/Mexico
border. The building high pressure will kickoff a slight warming
trend while the deep upper-level low will allow for the advection of
mid-level moisture from the south which will materialize in two
ways: virga and colorful sunrises/sunsets. Model soundings forecast
the mid-levels becoming saturated with a dry slot present in the low-
levels. This will be conducive for mid-level clouds and even virga
in some locations. Colorful sunrises/sunsets will also be possible
thanks to the mid-level moisture as well.

&&

.LONG TERM...
(Sunday through Friday)
Issued at 1229 AM PST Sat Nov 30 2024

High confidence in the long term forecast period as global ensemble
clusters are in agreement of ridging dominating the pattern. This
will result in a slight warming trend and no precipitation through
the first week of December.
