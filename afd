.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 200 AM PDT Mon Oct 14 2024

A slight warming trend bringing seasonal temperatures will continue
through Tuesday before an incoming upper level low brings isolated
rain chances Wednesday. Critical fire weather concerns are
expected late week through the upcoming weekend.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 200 AM PDT Mon Oct 14 2024

Seasonal temperatures and sky cover are expected across the region
as a weak short-wave ridge builds inland. Coastal drizzle this
morning will be possible as moist conditions prevail giving way to
mostly sunny conditions this afternoon, especially inland away from
the coast. Temperatures will warm into the upper 70`s to low 80`s
across the interior, the 70`s inland away from the coast/bays, and
mid to upper 60`s to low 70`s near the coast.

Tonight, low temperatures are forecast to range from the upper 40`s
to low 50`s for the interior and low-to-mid 50`s elsewhere. Once
again, coastal and favored upslope spots are likely to experience
drizzle.

.LONG TERM...
(Tuesday through Sunday)
Issued at 200 AM PDT Mon Oct 14 2024

Heading into Tuesday, conditions will remain near seasonal averages.
A stronger upper level low will push inland over the Pacific
Northwest brining with it a weak frontal boundary down into our
region. This will bring light precipitation to the North Bay with
little to no precipitation south of the Golden Gate on Wednesday.
However, probabilities remain low for "wetting rain" across even the
North Bay which will have negligible effect on increasing fuel
moisture across the region. This is a large shift from previous days
when most of the region was expecting at least some rainfall.

From previous forecaster: "The decrease in accumulating
precipitation also brings us to our second concern: elevated fire
weather concerns across the Bay Area and Central Coast beginning
late Thursday through the weekend. Both the European and GFS models
now show the upper level low continuing to strengthen and deepen as
it moves eastward through California/Nevada before eventually
becoming a cut-off low over the four corners region. Confidence is
increasing that a classic fire weather pattern, an "inside slider",
will develop and take place next weekend bringing widespread, gusty
offshore winds across the Bay Area and Central Coast. At 850 mb late
Thursday/early Friday, the GFS and Euro models are both showing
gusts between at least 40 to 45 mph with the GFS model showing some
potential for gusts close to 50 mph to develop. What does this
translate to at the surface? At the surface gusts will generally be
strongest across elevated terrain and mountain gaps/passes where
peak gusts look to be between 35-40 mph currently. There is
potential for stronger gusts to develop in the gaps and passes of
the East Bay Hills where we may see 40+ mph gusts during this event.
Forecasted sustained winds and wind gusts will continue to be
refined as we continue to move closer to the Thursday/Friday
timeframe. We will continue to monitor and provide updates on these
fire weather concerns as they evolve over the course of this week.
Residents of the Bay Area and the Central Coast should take
precautions to avoid all activities that may result in wildfire
spread/development next weekend. Remember: "One less spark, One less
wildfire."

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 345 AM PDT Mon Oct 14 2024

A mix of VFR/MVFR/IFR/LIFR, with clearing to VFR between 17-19Z.
There is a chance for clearing to occur after 20Z, as models show a
slower dissipation. Most terminals are expected to remain VFR
after Monday afternoon, until the end of the TAF period, with the
exception of KOAK, and Monterey Bay, where low stratus returns
Monday night. Winds will build to breezy by Monday afternoon,
before diminishing to moderate by Monday night.

Vicinity of SFO...VFR, with a chance for IFR conditions until 16Z,
but confidence is low. TEMPO group was included in TAFs to hint at
the possibility for lower CIGs. VFR is expected to prevail for the
remainder of the TAF period. Onshore winds will become breezy
Monday afternoon, with chances of 17 knot winds.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...LIFR conditions with some reduced
visibility over KSNS. Expect slow clearing Monday morning by 19Z,
with a chance for clearing near 20Z for KSNS. Low confidence that
KMRY will clear, as most models show a mix of MVFR/IFR/LIFR
conditions prevailing through the TAF period.

.MARINE...
(Today through Saturday)
Issued at 345 AM PDT Mon Oct 14 2024

Seas continue to build through the forecast period, becoming
elevated Monday afternoon bringing hazardous conditions for the
northern outer waters. Long period northwesterly swell of 13-17
seconds will result in elevated surf conditions through Wednesday.
A strong upper- level low will bring widespread near- gale to
gale force gusts beginning Thursday.

&&

.BEACHES...
Issued at 850 PM PDT Sun Oct 13 2024

Long period northwesterly swell of 13-17 seconds with wave heights
approaching 10 feet will result in a moderate risk of sneaker waves
across all Pacific Coast beaches through at least Wednesday. Large
waves can sweep across the beach without warning, pulling people
into the sea from rocks, jetties, and beaches. Beachgoers should
always remember to observe the ocean for 20 minutes before relaxing
near the water, keep your pets on a leash and away from the water,
and never turn your back on the ocean.
