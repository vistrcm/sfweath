...New UPDATE...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 252 AM PDT Tue Apr 2 2024

Sunny and warm through Tuesday. Onshore winds will increase late
Wednesday with cold temperatures and rain returning Thursday and
Friday.

.UPDATE...
Issued at 728 AM PDT Tue Apr 2 2024

For most of the forecast area this morning sunny skies to start
the day. However, as visible satellite imagery trickles in one can
see some stratus hugging the coast Half Moon Bay northward. There
is even some stratus sneaking up the Sonoma Valley. Sonoma County
Airport is also reporting dense fog with vsby sitting at one
quarter of a mile. All that being said, low clouds/fog will
gradually dissipate through mid-morning giving way to sunshine.


Sunny skies are expected today with above seasonal average
temperatures. No update need...

Afternoon forecast will fine tune details with upcoming pattern
change: cold and wet weather returning.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 252 AM PDT Tue Apr 2 2024

Another warm day is in store across the region with temperatures
expected to reach the upper 50s to mid 60s near the coast with
widespread 70s across the interior. Once low clouds near the coast
and locally inland dissipate, mostly sunny conditions will prevail
with no precipitation. Onshore winds will increase a bit this
afternoon and begin to weaken by late evening. For Tuesday night,
expecting temperatures to be in the mid/upper 40s and around 50
degrees near the coast.

&&

.LONG TERM...
(Wednesday through Monday)
Issued at 252 AM PDT Tue Apr 2 2024

Clouds will be on the increase by Wednesday as a deep upper level
trough begins to approach the region. This will bring temperatures
down into the upper 50s near the coast to upper 60s to lower 70s
inland as the cold front moves from north to south across the region
by late Wednesday.

From previous forecaster: In addition to the wind, the 1000-500 mb
thickness will rapidly fall from around 550 dm Wednesday afternoon
to the 520s late Thursday. This means the temperature on Thursday
will be drastically colder than it has been in the preceeding days,
with many inland areas dropping into the 30s. In fact, this polar
air mass may bring near record low temperatures to the upper levels.
The current NAM sounding for Oakland brings the 500 mb temperature
to -34C, which would be in the coldest 0.2% of all recorded
soundings from Oakland, and this is April.

While the front will bring wind and cold, the rain will hold off
until Thursday and Friday as a post-frontal trough develops over the
Bay Area. The total rainfall from this system is still looking light
to moderate at 0.10-0.50" for most populated areas. However, with
the very cold air aloft, there is a chance for instability to
trigger a few thunderstorms with locally higher rain totals and some
hail. The limiting factor for this is lack of moisture, with
precipitable water in the 0.3-0.4 inch range. Finally, the cold air
will bring some high elevation snow, with the best chance for
accumulation in the Santa Lucias above 3,000 ft.

The weekend looks mostly dry, but the cold temperatures will stick
around.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 427 AM PDT Tue Apr 2 2024

Subsiding air aloft i.e. thermal ridging with a high pressure
system is strongest over the northern forecast area resulting in a
marine layer temperature inversion, the Bodega Bay profiler shows
the marine layer depth is approx 1000 feet. The lower level
temperature inversion is relatively weaker at the Fort Ord
profiler. Morning satellite imagery shows stratus and fog /IFR-
LIFR/ mainly developing along coastal San Mateo County to Marin
and Sonoma Counties. Advective winds at this early hour are on the
light side thus not expecting much more inland intrusion, the SFO-
SAC pressure gradient is 0.8 mb. Radiative cooling to space until
sunrise will otherwise have to carry the bulk of remaining stratus
and/or fog development this morning. Post sunrise VFR is forecast,
winds becoming onshore during the afternoon and early evening.
Tonight and early Wednesday morning a combination of nocturnal
cooling and lower level cool air advection will result in better
chances of stratus and/or fog /IFR/ development as well as stratus
and/or fog moving inland.

Vicinity of SFO...VFR. The aforementioned thermal ridge aloft is
ever so gently shifting southward which may just get us through
daybreak with VFR continuing at the terminal and approach. West
wind increasing to 15 knots by afternoon, decreasing tonight to
near 5 knots. Low confidence on timing IFR ceiling tonight, the
thermal ridge aloft will still be moving south however it`ll be
weakening with lower level cool air advection also beginning.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO

Monterey Bay Terminals...VFR today. IFR ceilings developing
tonight and Wednesday morning. Southeasterly cool air drainage
winds 5 to 10 knots this morning becoming onshore 10 to 15 knots
in the afternoon and early evening. Winds tonight becoming light
and variable then southeasterly overnight.

.MARINE...
(Today through Sunday)
Issued at 349 AM PDT Tue Apr 2 2024

A high pressure system will persist over the coastal waters and
bays today then weaken tonight and Wednesday as an anomalously
strong and cold upper level trough arrives from the northwest. A
mainly dry cold front will move southeastward across the coastal
waters and bays Wednesday, northwesterly winds becoming gusty.
Behind the cold front Wednesday a modifying yet still cold for
early April maritime polar air mass and upper level trough will
result in gusty winds, rough seas, heavy showers and a slight
chance to chance of thunderstorms late Wednesday night to Friday.
Another upper level trough brings a slight chance of showers late
in the weekend.
