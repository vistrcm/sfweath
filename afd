...New UPDATE, MARINE...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 138 AM PDT Mon Sep 9 2024

Warm temperatures across the region persist into Monday, before a
deep upper level trough brings a major cooldown and breezy winds by
Tuesday and through the remainder of the week.

.UPDATE...
Issued at 846 AM PDT Mon Sep 9 2024

Satellite imagery shows extensive stratus coverage into the
western part of Marin county, southern Sonoma County, into the San
Francisco Bay region, across the Monterey Bay region and down the
Salinas Valley. Inland stratus is expected to mix out through the
morning, with the immediate coast remaining socked in through the
day. No changes to the forecast at this time.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 138 AM PDT Mon Sep 9 2024

Today temperatures will continue on a cooling trend as an upper
level trough begins to impact the Pacific Northwest and conditions
begin to cool aloft.  Afternoon maximum temperatures will reach the
upper 80`s to mid 90`s across the interior, low 70`s to low 80`s
around the Bayshore, and 60`s to mid 70`s near the Pacific coast. A
few of the warmest interior portions of Monterey and San Benito
counties will approach 100 degrees.

Tonight, expecting more widespread clouds to penetrate inland into
the coastal adjacent valleys as the marine layer begins to deepen.
Low temperatures will drop into the upper 40`s in the coldest
interior spots to the mid 50`s elsewhere. Areas around the Santa
Clara Valley will see temperatures in the mid-to-upper 50`s while
the hills and higher elevations only cool to the 60`s to low 70`s,
especially in the Central Coast.

&&

.LONG TERM...
(Tuesday through Sunday)
Issued at 138 AM PDT Mon Sep 9 2024

A more substantial upper level trough will drop into the Pacific
Northwest by Tuesday and Wednesday. This will drop temperatures back
to near or below seasonal averages with mid 70`s to mid 80`s across
the interior and more widespread 60`s at the coast. Winds will also
increase generally out of the northwest reaching 20-30 mph in the
gaps and passes. Any precipitation with this system looks to remain
to the north with forecast guidance trending drier across our
region. Some offshore flow is possible as the low shifts across the
Intermountain West on Thursday, especially in the higher elevations.
However, it does not appear to be a great setup for stronger
offshore winds.

The 6-10 and 8-14 Day Outlooks indicates temperatures below
seasonal averages and precipitation above seasonal averages into the
third week of September.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 518 AM PDT Mon Sep 9 2024

Initial push of stratus has slowed down which is lowering confidence
in prolonged stratus coverage reaching STS, APC, OAK, SFO, and SJC.
Current thinking is that stratus will still reach these airports but
it will be more patchy/temporary in nature with 13-17Z as the most
likely timeframe. Tempos have been put in place for these airports.
Elevated fog potential continues for the North Bay and Monterey Bay
regions but confidence is low to moderate with observations showing
improved visibilities this morning compared to the same time
yesterday. If any fog does develop it will occur in the 13-17Z time
frame and mix out by late morning. Low to moderate confidence on
timing of stratus return tomorrow - ensemble guidance has been
overwhelmingly too aggressive with initial stratus push compared to
obs which is lowering confidence in the early return guidance is
currently forecasting. Using a mix of WRF guidance and persistence,
current thinking is that stratus will return by late evening in the
08-10Z timeframe with an earlier return between 01-03Z only expected
along the Central Coast. Light to moderate northwest winds generally
persist through the TAF period with winds becoming lighter and
locally variable overnight.

Vicinity of SFO...Patchy IFR CIGs are expected to impact SFO through
late this morning before VFR returns. Given lower confidence in
ensemble guidance, today`s stratus forecast is primarily based on
persistence wherein only patchy stratus has reached SFO for the past
few days under similar atmospheric conditions. It is worth noting,
however, that the NAMNEST does not have stratus reaching SFO and its
stratus coverage forecast over the SF Bay region is most similar to
current stratus observations. Stratus is expected to return late
tonight and persist through the end of the TAF period. Moderate
northwest winds continue with gusts up to 25 knots possible during
the afternoon/evening.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...IFR conditions continue through the late
morning before VFR conditions temporarily return this afternoon. An
early return of stratus is expected this evening with IFR CIGs
persisting till the end of the period. Some potential for patchy
dense fog remains this morning with any fog that does develop mixing
out by late morning. The NBM and HRRR continue to suggest that MRY
will remain socked in all day but confidence in this scenario
remains low at this time. Light to moderate northwest winds
generally continue through the TAF period. Winds may become more
locally variable during the mid to late morning hours.

&&

.MARINE...
(Today through Saturday)
Issued at 846 AM PDT Mon Sep 9 2024

Light north to northwesterly winds continue today. Patchy dense
fog is possible across the coastal waters, particularly across the
Monterey Bay, dissipating by mid to late morning. Winds will
gradually strengthen on Tuesday as an upper level low pressure
system approaches from the north. This system will move through
the region midweek bringing moderate and gusty north to
northwesterly winds and elevated wave heights across the coastal
waters. Unsettled conditions will continue through the end of the
week as a second upper level low arrives next weekend.
