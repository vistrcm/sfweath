.KEY MESSAGES...
Updated at 1203 AM PST Thu Jan 29 2026

 - Above normal temperatures and dry conditions through most of
   the forecast period

 - Minor coastal flooding for bayshore locations along the San
   Francisco Bay, San Pablo Bay, and Monterey Bay through Sunday

 - Hazardous beach conditions at Pacific Coast beaches through
   Monday

.SHORT TERM...
Issued at 1203 AM PST Thu Jan 29 2026
(Today and tonight)

Surface high pressure across the West and a coastal trough off the
Pacific Coast will continue to facilitate light offshore flow across
the region. The only impact is radiational fog in the Russian River
Valley. If driving in the area, slow down, use your low-beam
headlights, and leave plenty of distance ahead of you. Other than
that, longwave upper-level ridging across the West will result in a
warming trend through Saturday with maximum temperatures around 10
degrees above normal. Higher elevation minimum temperatures will be
10 degrees above normal with coastal and valley locations near to
slightly above normal. SJC will challenge its daily maximum
temperature on Saturday - the previous record is 71 degrees set in
2015. Hazardous beach conditions will unfortunately coexist with
fair weather, please read the BEACHES section below for more
details. Minor coastal flooding is expected to return today and
persist through Sunday (during the highest tides of the day) to
bayshore locations along the San Francisco Bay, San Pablo Bay, and
Monterey Bay. The forecast has taken into account 0.4 ft of storm
surge. Confidence is moderate due to the uncertainty in: the
development of the aforementioned low, the impact of the swell, and
wind direction.

.LONG TERM...
Issued at 1203 AM PST Thu Jan 29 2026
(Friday through Wednesday)

The aforementioned ridge will get booted out by an upper-level low
in the Gulf of Alaska with the resulting pattern yielding zonal to
slightly troughy flow across the region on Sunday. This will renew
rain chances, but don`t get too excited. The ensembles of the ECMWF
and GFS show only a handful of members bringing any rain to the
region during this timeframe with the official forecast keeping it
all over the water. Right now, the most likely scenario looks to be
a pause in the warming trend, an increase in cloud cover, and maybe
some drizzle for the North Bay. Global ensemble clusters are in
agreement that longwave ridging will quickly rebuild Monday, likely
persisting through next Friday at least. This will yield dry weather
and another warming trend with conditions very similar to what is
expected in the short term.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 326 AM PST Thu Jan 29 2026

Patchy and shallow fog has developed over the Santa Rosa Plain,
including at STS, and within portions of the Russian River Valley,
which are expected to continue through the morning with similar
conditions developing tonight. Otherwise, generally VFR conditions
persist through the TAF period with a gentle onshore breeze this
afternoon for the coastal terminals, while gentle offshore flow
develops inland around the same time.

Vicinity of SFO... VFR through the TAF period. Light to gentle
winds, generally from the east, through the morning before a gentle
northwest breeze develops in the afternoon.

SFO Bridge Approach... Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals... VFR through the TAF period. Drainage winds
persist through the morning, breezy at SNS, with a light to gentle
northwest wind developing in the afternoon and evening before
drainage winds resume this evening.

.MARINE...
(Today through Tuesday)
Issued at 326 AM PST Thu Jan 29 2026

Gentle to moderate northerly breezes continue through Friday
before winds veer and become southerly over the weekend. Rough
seas are expected today across the coastal waters, diminishing to
moderate on Friday and Saturday before rough seas return Sunday
and Monday.

&&

.BEACHES...
Issued at 347 AM PST Wed Jan 28 2026

Hazardous beach conditions return to all Pacific Coast beaches
tonight and persist through Friday morning. Long period westerly
swell will bring an increased risk for sneaker waves and strong
rip currents with breaking waves of 14 to 19 feet. Remember: stay
off of jetties, piers, rocks, and other waterside infrastructure,
remain out of the water to avoid hazardous surf, and never turn
your back on the ocean!
