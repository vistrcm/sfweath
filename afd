...New UPDATE, MARINE...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 324 AM PDT Sun Apr 6 2025

A weak cold front later today into tonight will bring light rain
chances to the North Bay. The warming trend will continue today with
a slight pause on Monday, resuming Tuesday through the remainder of
the extended forecast. A Beach Hazard Statement remains in place
through Monday night.

.UPDATE...
Issued at 840 AM PDT Sun Apr 6 2025

KMUX remains in clear air mode as rain is still well off to our
north/northwest as evident on our neighbor Eureka`s radar KBHX. As
the weak cold front slowly makes its way towards the West Coast,
expect high cloud cover to increase throughout the day. Rain of up
to a quarter of an inch is still on tap for the North Bay with
maybe some sites south of the Golden Gate Bridge able to squeeze
out some drizzle or even light rain with the help of orographic
lift. This very well may be one of the last rains of the season,
so soak it up and embrace it if you enjoy it!

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 324 AM PDT Sun Apr 6 2025

Upper level ridging will continue to drive warmer than normal
temperatures today across our region as the associated ridge axis
pivots inland and the leading edge of an offshore trough pushes a
weak cold front through our area late tonight into early Monday.
High clouds associated with the leading edge of the developing
trough will gradually increase across our area today and tonight.
We`re not expecting any impacts from the light rain. With the
great weather today people visiting our coastal communities need
to remember the risk of sneaker waves and rip tides as long period
northwest swell has resulted hazardous beach conditions today and
tomorrow.

.LONG TERM...
(Monday through Saturday)
Issued at 324 AM PDT Sun Apr 6 2025

The cooler post frontal airmass and cloud cover will disrupt the
warming trend for much of our area on Monday, lifting to above
normal again on Tuesday for most locations (especially inland).
Wednesday and Thursday will be the warmest days through the extended
forecast. Consensus is low for deterministic guidance for the end of
the week and next window. However, the ridging responsible for the
warmer temperatures this week is expected to shift east of our area
by next weekend and cool temperatures closer to normal. There is a
weak signal for some light rain toward the end of the extended
forecast with the best chances well north of our area.

.MARINE...
(Today through Friday)
Issued at 840 AM PDT Sun Apr 6 2025

A weak cold front will slowly move eastward across the coastal
waters later today and tonight, bringing light rain to the
northern waters. A WNW moderate to rough swell will reach the
coastal waters today and persist through Monday before gradually
abating through the week.

.BEACHES...
Issued at 418 AM PDT Sun Apr 5 2025

A Beach Hazard Statement remains in effect for the entire
coastline. A long period swell is forecast to reach the coast
this morning. Forerunners of 18-20 sec arrive close to sunrise.
Swell periods are forecast to diminish through the day to Monday,
but swell heights will gradually increase. Therefore, initially
sneaker waves will be the main threat before switching to larger
shore break and rip currents. Beachgoers should be mindful Sunday
and Monday given potential hazards. Beachgoers should stay off of
jetties and rocks, keep pets on a leash, wear a life jacket, and
never turn your back on the ocean!
