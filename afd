...New UPDATE, MARINE...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 304 AM PDT Thu Mar 28 2024

Breezy and cool today with only a few passing showers. Southerly
winds increase Friday morning ahead of the next storm that will
bring rain and scattered thunderstorms to the region Friday into
Saturday. Drying trend Sunday as high pressure builds and lasts
through the middle of next week with a return to dry and
seasonably mild weather.

.UPDATE...
Issued at 852 AM PDT Thu Mar 28 2024

Rain showers are currently moving through the region south of San
Francisco, impacting KSFO, and portions of the East Bay at this
hour. Additional showers are moving across the Santa Cruz Mountains,
into the Santa Clara Valley, soon to impact the Central Coast, while
light rain is being reported as far north as KSTS (Santa Rosa).
However, most of the region will be dry today and tonight outside of
passing showers.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 304 AM PDT Thu Mar 28 2024

Light to locally moderate showers will move through the region today
in the wake of last night`s cold front and under the influence of
the trough building to the north. Expect cloudy and cool
conditions between the showers through the day, with showers
becoming more isolated into the the evening. Expect a brief pause
in rain chances Thursday night, but the next system arrives Friday
morning.

.LONG TERM...
(Friday through Wednesday)
Issued at 304 AM PDT Thu Mar 28 2024

Another quicker-moving cold front and low pressure move into the
region along the current trough pattern. While the cold front moves
inland, the low looks to remain along the coast line and begin to
slowly progress southward. This places light warm-sector showers
in the North Bay starting early Friday with the main rain band
along the cold front moving inland late Friday morning and into
that afternoon. Breezy to gusty winds build ahead the front and
linger into that night. Wind Advisories have been issued for the
San Francisco Peninsula Coast, Santa Cruz Mountains, East Bay
Hills, coastal Monterey Bay, the Big Sur Coast and San Benito Co.

Thunderstorm and scattered shower chances move in behind the main
rain band. The spread of these post frontal rains still spread
across the Bay Area and Central Coast Friday night through Saturday
evening, with storm chances peaking around 25% during that time
frame. Shower activity begins to dissipate into Saturday night, rain
exiting Sunday as the low continues to move south.

Rainfall totals from early Friday through Sunday morning look to
range from:

-0.5" to 1" for most areas
-1" to 1.25" for coastal low lands and interior North Bay
-1.25" to 2" for higher elevations along the coast
- and above 2" for the highest peaks along the coast with some
isolated areas on the Big Sur Coast reaching above 3"

This system still offers some variability, so be sure to keep
checking in.

After Sunday, dry weather returns as a ridge pattern forms over the
California Coast.

to shift to a southerly heading and become gusty ahead of the
approaching low pressure system. Rain will impact the terminals
just beyond the current TAF period.

shower passes over the terminal. VFR through the TAF period. Winds
will become breezy out of the west by this afternoon. Towards the

(Today through Tuesday)
Issued at 852 AM PDT Thu Mar 28 2024

Scattered showers continue to move over the coastal waters as
yesterday`s cold front exits the area and a second low pressure
system approaches. Gentle to moderate westerly to northwesterly
breezes will continue through the remainder of Thursday before
moderate to strong southwesterly winds develop ahead of the
