...New UPDATE, MARINE...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 312 AM PST Thu Jan 2 2025

Mostly dry today, widespread light rain starting late tonight for
the North Bay spreading across much of the region on Friday.
Conditions dry out for the weekend which then holds into next
week.

.UPDATE...
Issued at 816 AM PST Thu Jan 2 2025

The forecast remains on track this morning with no updates needed at
this time. We are still looking for a frontal boundary to move
through the region late tonight across the North Bay and then spread
southward across the remainder of the region on Friday. This
rainfall will be mostly beneficial with the North Bay most likely to
see rises on creeks and streams. In addition, we are continue to
monitor the forecast with respect to high surf late Friday night
into Saturday.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 312 AM PST Thu Jan 2 2025

Zonal flow is expected over the region today, as weak upper level
high pressure holds over southern CA and upper level disturbance
advances towards the PacNW. This keeps us dry through much of the
day, with North Bay counties potentially seeing rain just before
midnight.

&&

.LONG TERM...
(Friday through Wednesday)
Issued at 312 AM PST Thu Jan 2 2025

Beneficial rain will work its way south and eastward across the
region on Friday. This will likely be the last hurrah for rain
for the foreseeable future as ensemble and cluster analysis shows
ridging holding through the second week of January. Look for a
warming and drying trend during this period, which matches the CPC
6-10 day outlook of temperatures likely above normal and
precipitation likely below normal for this time of year.

.MARINE...
(Today through Tuesday)
Issued at 816 AM PST Thu Jan 2 2025

Light winds and moderate seas will prevail today. An incoming cold
front will bring moderate southerly winds and widespread light

.BEACHES...
Issued at 105 AM PST Thu Jan 2 2025

Wave model forecasts indicate long period westerly swell temporarily
arriving along the coastline from Sonoma County to Monterey County
Friday night, decreasing to a moderate period westerly swell Saturday.
While we anticipate an increase in surf, at the present time there
is some uncertainty as to how much there will be according to recent
modeled swell height and period forecasts. Please stay tuned to any
further updates.

Also at the current time, wave model forecasts are showing a newly
arriving long period westerly swell Monday into Tuesday. As always
whenever there is increasing surf - remember to never turn your back
on the ocean and stay out of the water. Again please stay tuned to any
further updates for late week, additionally for early next week.
