.SHORT TERM...
Issued at 257 AM PDT Sun Jul 6 2025
(Today and tonight)

An upper level closed low off the coast of Northern California will
linger off the coast of the Bay Area Sunday into the early work
week. This will result in seasonal to below normal temperatures with
highs in the upper 70s to 80s across the interior and upper 50s to
60s along the coastline. The warmest locations within the interior
Central Coast and far interior East Bay Hills will reach the low 90s
today. For context, today`s forecast high temperatures are running
approximately 5 to 10 degrees below normal for this time of year
with below normal temperatures expected to continue for the first
half of the upcoming week. The marine layer has deepened to around
1000ft to 1200 ft this morning with further deepening to 1500-2000ft
expected tonight. Satellite shows stratus extending along much of
the coastline and filtering into the San Francisco Bay shoreline and
portions of the interior valleys. Conditions will start to clear by
mid to late morning but widespread stratus is expected to return
late tonight, continuing overnight into Monday. Locally breezy winds
with gusts to around 25 mph are expected across the Altamont Pass
region and Salinas Valley this afternoon and evening. Otherwise,
today remains fairly pleasant and will be a good day to get
outside.

.LONG TERM...
Issued at 257 AM PDT Sun Jul 6 2025
(Monday through Saturday)

For the first portion of the Long Term (Monday-Tuesday), not much
changes compared to this weekend. The upper level closed low will
linger off the coast of the Bay Area through Tuesday, keeping
temperatures below normal and maintaining a fairly deep marine
layer. Highs across the interior will generally be in the 70s to 80s
with the warmest interior locations reaching the low 90s. Coastal
areas will continue to see cooler areas in the upper 50s to 60s. In
terms of stratus, "No Sky July" is well underway for coastal areas
with coastal locations to see stratus returning each night and
dissipating by mid to late morning. Stratus is expected to push into
the San Francisco Bay Shoreline, portions of the Santa Clara Valley,
and the North Bay Valleys Monday and Tuesday nights as the marine
layer deepens to around 1500-2000ft. Coastal drizzle is likely
overnight Monday and Tuesday with the persistent upper level closed
low and deeper marine layer.

For the second part of the Long Term (Wednesday-Saturday), the upper
level closed low begins to weaken Wednesday and progresses into far
northern CA and Oregon. As this occurs, upper level high pressure
over the Four Corners region expands and shifts into southern
California, bringing zonal flow to slight ridging over the Bay Area.
this will kick off a warming trend with highs in the 80s to 90s
across the interior. The warmest locations (portions of the East Bay
Hills, Interior North Bay Mountains, and Interior Central coast)
will reach the upper 90s to low 100s. The warmest days this week
look to be Thursday and Friday where moderate HeatRisk is set to
impact the Bay Area. Moderate HeatRisk impacts anyone who is
sensitive to heat and does not have access to adequate
cooling/hydration. Temperatures remain warm on Saturday but will be
a few degrees cooler with highs generally in the 80s to low 90s
across the interior. It is worth noting that models continue to have
trouble with if more zonal flow vs shortwave ridging will develop
which may result in changes to the forecast temperatures for next
week.

Stratus is moving up the valley toward STS early this morning, and
is expected to reach the terminal by 12z. Low LIFR to MVFR
ceilings are expected to persist through late morning, becoming
VFR for the afternoon. MVFR/IFR ceilings are not expected to
return to the North Bay terminals until after midnight.

Vicinity of SFO...MVFR ceilings are expected to persist through
late morning with VFR expected through the afternoon into the late
evening hours when stratus moves back in over the terminal for the
remainder of the TAF period.

SFO Bridge Approach...Same as SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...LIFR/IFR ceilings are expected to persist
through late morning, becoming VFR throughout the afternoon hours
with MVFR/IFR stratus ceilings returning early this evening for
the remainder of the TAF period.
