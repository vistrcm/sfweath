.UPDATE...
Issued at 840 AM PDT Thu Aug 29 2024

Coastal stratus has indeed pushed quite far inland, including all
of the North bay and Salinas Valleys and even some patches near
Livermore, but the latest satellite imagery has shown some mixing
out along the fringes. Expect the clearing to continue through the
morning with some stratus lingering through the day along the
immediate coast. The forecast remains on track with no changes at
this time.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 1201 AM PDT Thu Aug 29 2024

While most people are heading to sleep, we are just putting the
final touches on the forecast. As we do so, coastal stratus is
continuing to push inland, having infiltrated much further inland
at this hour than the same time yesterday. This is all thanks to a
deepening marine layer, which currently sits at about 1800`, and
is rising. This deepening is thanks to troughing that has
developed over our region, allowing for air to rise. As it does
so, a cooling trend is taking place, with high temperatures
expected to be close to average today. Highs today are expected to
be in the upper 80s and low 90s in the interior, and closer to
the upper 70s and low 80s for the bay shorelines.

.LONG TERM...
(Friday through Wednesday)
Issued at 1201 AM PDT Thu Aug 29 2024

Friday and into the weekend,
the cooling trend continues as troughing persists and a cutoff low
approaches the coastline. As it does, temperatures will dip to
become slightly below average with highs in the mid 80s for the
interior, and 70s for the bays. Winds through the weekend will be
onshore, with the seabreeze creating typical breezy conditions for
the coast and delta region in the afternoons. Overall, it will be
pleasant, so, get out there and enjoy the fall-like weather this
holiday weekend!

However, warmer weather begins to return Tuesday. A ridge begins to
develop as the aforementioned cutoff low exits to our northeast.
These warmer temperatures are in agreement with CPC 6-10 and 8-14
day outlooks which suggest above-normal temperatures during this
time period for our region. Additionally, as things warm up again
next week, something to mention and keep an eye on will be relative
humidity levels decreasing (both max and min), as well as a more
northerly wind pattern. Northerly winds can lend to further drying
of already parched fuels, which combined with low relative
humidities, can increase the risk of fire starts. Although those
northerly winds currently appear to be light for the time period,
they will nonetheless be dry and warm. This is pattern shift to keep
a close eye on over the next few days as it develops. Currently no
products issued.
