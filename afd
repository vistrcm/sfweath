.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 130 AM PDT Fri Mar 15 2024

Breezy offshore flow prevails this morning in the peaks of the North
Bay and East Bay as well as the Santa Cruz Mountains. They will
begin to diminish by late morning or early afternoon as the pressure
gradient begins to weaken. This afternoon will feature temperatures
in the low-to-mid 70s across the interior with mid-to-upper 60s at
the coast. Low temperatures tonight will range from the mid 40s to
lower 50s with the exception being the interior Central Coast where
upper 30s to lower 40s are expected.

.LONG TERM...
(Saturday through Thursday)
Issued at 130 AM PDT Fri Mar 15 2024

Slight cooling is expected at the coast Saturday and Sunday as
offshore flow becomes onshore. Still looking like coastal areas will
warm into the low-to-mid 60s while the interior areas will reach the
lower 70s. High pressure rebuilds across the region Monday through
Wednesday brining low-to-mid 70s across the interior with mid-to-
upper 60s at the coast.

A return to unsettled conditions is expected by the time we get to
the latter half of the upcoming week. This will occur as an upper
level trough approaches the region. However, at this time, rainfall
(if any) amounts are expected to be light.
