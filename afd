...New MARINE...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 112 AM PDT Wed May 7 2025

Warm and dry conditions through Saturday, unsettled weather
returns the second half of the weekend.

&&

.UPDATE...
Issued at 919 AM PDT Wed May 7 2025

A very deep marine layer is bringing stratus throughout all of the
North Bay, although dry air is keeping some parts of the remaining
interior Bay Area scattered. The biggest forecast challenge today
is high temperatures Friday-Saturday. Our current forecast is
based entirely on the National Blend of Models deterministic
output, which is running near the 25th percentile of the NBM
ensemble mean. While there is little uncertainty with the pattern
through Saturday, small changes in wind direction can have a big
impact/ For example, I looked back at past years when the 850 mb
temperature was measured between 17-18 C during the middle 2
weeks of May. While this is in the 90th percentile of
observations, the high temperature at King City has ranged from
75F to 98F within my small random sample of 6. This obviously
could have a big impact on any possible heat advisory for the
Southern Salinas Valley and, once I figure out the official
forecast blend, I will discuss my methods and reasoning on the
afternoon AFD.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 112 AM PDT Wed May 7 2025

Zonal flow will result in a pretty average Bay Area and Central
Coast day, at least weather wise. Temperatures will be near seasonal
normals and diurnal winds will return this afternoon. The marine
layer is being observed at 3,000 feet at the Fort Ord Profiler.
Satellite shows stratus filling in coastal and valley locations and
continuing to expand with the possibility of drizzle through the
morning. Stratus is expected to retreat towards and remain
confined to the coast during the afternoon hours. A dry cold front
will bring high cloud cover to the region this afternoon, so
perhaps a beautiful sunset is on tap for this evening.

.LONG TERM...
(Thursday through Tuesday)
Issued at 112 AM PDT Wed May 7 2025

20 degrees above normal Friday to 20 degrees below normal Tuesday is
the definition of a spring roller coaster, buckle up. The warming
trend kicks off Thursday as an upper-level shortwave ridge begins
to build in to the West. Friday will be the warmest day of the
week with moderate HeatRisk in the Southern Salinas Valley and
minor HeatRisk elsewhere. Heights begin to fall as the upper-level
shortwave ridge shifts eastward and troughing begins to develop
off the West Coast. There still remains uncertainty in the
strength and subsequently location and timing of the upper-level
low/trough, but generally speaking expect cool and windy
conditions, an increase in cloud cover, and light rain in the
North Bay the second half of the weekend and into early next week.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 500 AM PDT Wed May 7 2025

Stratus has penetrated much farther inland this morning, with
satellite imagery showing the majority of our valleys and coastal
areas blanketed by cloud cover. Sites have generally been reporting
MVFR cigs overnight, though there were some periods of IFR cigs.
Expect stratus to gradually erode throughout the morning leaving
most TAF sites with VFR conditions for the afternoon. The exception
looks to be at KHAF where the clouds should hug close enough to the
coast to keep MVFR cigs in place and while sea spray continues to
reduce visibility. Tonight, stratus surges inland again bringing
another night of widespread MVFR cigs to much of the region. There
is some uncertainty about East and South Bay valleys and sites,
though opted to hint at the potential given that some hi-res model
guidance is quite aggressive.

Vicinity of SFO...Stratus has more or less surrounded KSFO this
morning with VFR conditions holding overnight. Guidance has tried to
depict at the stratus closing in at the terminal for a few hours
around sunrise this morning, but confidence is low to medium in that
happening. Rather than carry BKN or OVC MVFR cigs for several hours,
opted to hint at that potential with a TEMPO and keeping the
prevailing as FEW010 or FEW015 later on this morning. We should see
stratus retreat by mid to late morning, leave us with an afternoon
of VFR conditions. Another tricky night is on tap, with models
struggling on whether or not the stratus settles over SFO. Opted to
hint at the possibility of MVFR cigs overnight but ultimately kept
VFR conditions in place. This will likely be dependent on how strong
the westerly moisture surge becomes.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...We are substantially more socked in with
stratus this morning compared to yesterday, with mainly MVFR to
localized pockets of IFR being reported so far. Expect cloud cover
to hold for the next couple of hours, and then gradually retreat as
the sun comes out and mixes things up. The question for today will
be, will the stratus retreat all the way to the coast and peninsula.
Most guidance suggests yes for a few hours of VFR conditions this
afternoon. The stratus surges back in this evening with another
night of MVFR cigs. There are some signs of IFR cigs possible but
opted to go with more of the persistence forecast based on the
observations we`ve seen the last two nights.

.MARINE...
(Today through Monday)
Issued at 933 AM PDT Wed May 7 2025

Moderate northwest winds persist over the northern coastal waters
through this evening before fresh gusts build back in Wednesday
night into Thursday. Elsewhere, gentle to moderate southerly winds
will gradually turn northwesterly throughout the day. Moderate
seas continue through the end of the forecast period. Moderate to
fresh northwest winds will continue ease through this morning.
Northerly winds strengthen Friday through Saturday with widespread
fresh to strong gusts expected as an upper level trough moves
inland.
