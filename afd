.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 118 AM PDT Wed Apr 10 2024

Warm temps continue through Thursday with afternoon highs 10-15
degrees above seasonal normals. Transition day set for Friday as
the next system moves in, bringing widespread wind and rain, as
well as a slight chance for thunderstorms for the Central Coast
Saturday.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 118 AM PDT Wed Apr 10 2024

Warmest day of the week so far on tap today as the broad ridge
sets up over the West Coast. Afternoon temps will largely be in
the 70s across the area, with a few inland locations making it
into the lower 80s. Areas along the coast will remain in the mid-
to- upper 60s. There is a slight chance of some high clouds
spoiling the high temps just a bit and keeping some locations a
couple of degrees cooler than the current forecast. However, even
at a couple of degrees cooler, it will still be the warmest that
we`ve seen in several months. There`s a minor heat risk,
particularly for sensitive groups (elderly and infants). Be sure
to never leave children or pets in unattended vehicles. If you`re
working or playing outdoors, be sure to hydrate with plenty of
water.

.LONG TERM...
(Thursday through Tuesday)
Issued at 118 AM PDT Wed Apr 10 2024

Another warm day Thursday with temps near to a couple of degrees
cooler than today. However, it was noted that the progression of
the incoming system has slowed slightly, which resulted in
nudging temps slightly upwards for Thursday. If the system slows
even further, high temps Thursday will need to be adjusted higher,
which may result in moderate Heat Risk for inland valley
locations. With a slower moving trough, more and more of the area
could remain rain-free through at least Friday afternoon (though
clouds will increase). The exception to this will be parts of the
North Bay (near and north of a Bodega Bay to Cloverdale line).
While the current forecast advertises around a 20-30 PoP late
Friday into Saturday, the more probable area for rainfall (closer
to 50%) will be across the North Bay during the daylight hours. As
the upper level low churns and drops southward through the pre-
dawn hours on Saturday, rain chances will fill in from north to
south.

As of this issuance, it appears that most of the rain will fall
during the Saturday morning time frame. Overall amounts and
intensities have not changed much from the previous forecast, with
1-2" for the Santa Lucia and Santa Cruz Mtns, 0.5-1" elsewhere,
and 0.25-0.5" for inland rainshadowed valleys. Additionally, there
does appear to be a hint of instability Saturday afternoon.
Depending on the arrival time and setup location of the surface
low, there is the potential for thunderstorms Saturday afternoon
into the evening, particularly from the Santa Cruz Mtns southward
along the Central Coast.

Forecast uncertainty continues through Sunday as the range of
solutions widens. If the upper low quickly translates eastward,
then morning rain showers will yield to improving conditions in
the afternoon. However, if the upper trough continues to amplify
(which would be more in line with the current trends), then there
will be a potential that showers and thunderstorms would linger
later in the afternoon. Stay tuned for updates as the forecast
still exhibits a degree of variability for the upcoming weekend.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 431 AM PDT Wed Apr 10 2024

Shallow/compressed marine layer developed overnight leading to low
clouds along the coast nudging inland. Additionally, patchy dense
fog also developed LIFR and VLIFR conditions. Biggest impacts are
confined to Sonoma Valley and Monterey Bay terminals. Otherwise,
expecting VFR at all terminals this afternoon. Tonight will be
tricky as a shallow marine layer will nudge inland again. A few
more terminals have low clouds for tonight, but confidence is
medium (50-60%) on low clouds developing.

Vicinity of SFO...Low clouds hugging the coast and into the gap,
but terminal remains VFR. Expecting VFR through early tonight.
Will bring a shallow cig in early Thursday, but probabilistic
guidance has about a 40-60% of cigs developing. Even if cigs
develop early Thursday they`ll dissipate by mid morning.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...VLIFR for KMRY, but VFR for KSNS. KSNS
conditions improved dramatically with cigs and fog rolling back to
Monterey coast. Do expect VFR this afternoon. Shallow marine layer
rolls back in early tonight with patchy fog possible.

.MARINE...
(Today through Monday)
Issued at 431 AM PDT Wed Apr 10 2024

Northwesterly winds continue along the California coast thanks to
high pressure over the Eastern Pacific. Winds are locally stronger
over the outer waters resulting in steeper wind waves and
hazardous conditions. Conditions over the waters deteriorate
Thursday night as a storm system returns bringing strong winds
and rain. Unsettled weather lingers into the weekend.
