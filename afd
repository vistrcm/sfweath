.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 1209 AM PST Thu Jan 9 2025

Offshore winds have largely ended across the region. Gusty
conditions this afternoon isolated to the ridgetops of the
interior North Bay. Quiet weather Friday with returning offshore
winds Saturday into early next week.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and Friday)
Issued at 1209 AM PST Thu Jan 9 2025

Gusty offshore winds have thankfully coming to and end across the
Bay Area this morning. Some isolated gusts along the ridgetops of
the interior North Bay mountains may linger through this
afternoon, but are expected to be very isolated to these higher
peaks. For example, as of writing, Mt. St. Helena is gusting to 60
mph, and Sonoma County Airport is at 0 mph. Overall today will be
a very nice day across the Bay Area and Central Coast with mostly
clear skies and temps in the 60s to lower 70s. Much of the same
Friday with temps perhaps a bit lower due to an incoming cold
front associated with a transient upper low set to push through
the Great Basin this weekend.

.LONG TERM...
(Saturday through Wednesday)
Issued at 1209 AM PST Thu Jan 9 2025

By Saturday, surface high pressure begins to build over the PNW
and Great Basin, once again promoting offshore winds. At this
time, the forecast has trended downwards slightly in terms of
magnitude, but winds will likely be more widespread across the
North Bay and Bay Area. The current forecast keeps things under
Wind Advisory criteria, but we are keeping a close eye on the
Saturday night/Sunday morning timeframe. The offshore pressure
gradient lingers through the first half of next week with a
deepening upper low moving into the Desert SW. However, there is
still a good deal of uncertainty with exactly how this slow moving
and nearly stagnant upper low pattern will play out, and the
uncertainty as of now mainly exists in varying degrees of
offshore wind. The other impactful bit of weather over the next
few days will be the cool overnight temperatures this weekend and
early next week. Overnight lows are currently forecast in the mid-
to- upper 30s in the North Bay valleys and interior Central Coast
beginning Sunday morning into the middle of the week.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 307 AM PST Thu Jan 9 2025

Offshore winds will ease today with dry conditions and VFR expected
through much of the TAF period. There is a signal for potential LIFR
fog at the KSTS terminal early Thursday morning and again Friday
morning.

Vicinity of SFO...VFR with light and variable winds continuing
through Thursday morning when winds increase marginally out of the
northwest in the afternoon. Winds ease and become light/variable
late Thursday night and into Friday morning.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...VFR with light southerly winds through the
Thursday morning. Winds will increase slightly Thursday afternoon
out of the north-northwest before becoming southerly once again
Friday morning.

&&

.MARINE...
(Today through Tuesday)
Issued at 307 AM PST Thu Jan 9 2025

High pressure over the Great Basin will result in generally light
offshore winds across the bays and coastal waters through late
Thursday night. On Friday the high pressure system weakens while a
low pressure trough moves eastward across the Pacific Northwest.
Surface high pressure then rebuilds over the Great Basin during
the weekend. This will bring a return of offshore winds to the
bays and coastal waters over the weekend. Seas and gusty north
winds gradually abate during the remainder of the week then build
again over the weekend into the early part of next week.

.MTR WATCHES/WARNINGS/ADVISORIES...

PZ...Small Craft Advisory from 3 PM to 9 PM PST Friday for Pt Arena
     to Pt Reyes 10-60 NM.
