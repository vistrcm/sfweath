...New AVIATION...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 233 AM PDT Mon May 26 2025

Seasonable temperatures and breezy afternoons through midweek.
Warmer temps 10-20 degrees above average by the end of the week
with a moderate risk for heat-related illness among those
susceptible to heat. Elevated risk for grass fire starts for
inland areas this weekend as well with very dry conditions
anticipated.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 233 AM PDT Mon May 26 2025

A slew of high clouds moving through the region this morning in
response to a weak upper level trough. Not much notable change today
compared to yesterday aside from some mixed cloud layers. A few
inland locations may end up a bit cooler than yesterday due to the
increased cloud cover. Otherwise looks like a beautiful Memorial Day.

.LONG TERM...
(Tuesday through Sunday)
Issued at 233 AM PDT Mon May 26 2025

Still anticipated to be quiet through the middle of the week with a
subtle warming trend on tap, peaking this weekend. By Thursday we
start to see above average temperatures spread across much of the
region, increasing further into the weekend. Friday looks to be the
warmest day of the forecast period with highs 10 to 20 degrees above
normal (low end near the coast, high end inland). Conditions will be
hazardous for those who are sensitive to heat, and those without
adequate cooling and/or hydration across interior areas and South
Bay urban areas. In terms of fire weather, Friday is expected to be
very dry inland with RH in the 15-25% range and poor overnight
recovery above 2,000 feet. Winds do not appear critical at the
moment, but we will begin messaging elevated fire danger late week
and going into the weekend. The building ridge of high pressure
responsible for this pattern appears to be very well advertised
among ensemble members. Thus, confidence is high. Potential for the
heat to be curtailed and cooler, more seasonable temperatures return
by the beginning of next week.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 422 AM PDT Mon May 26 2025

Challenging forecast again this morning. This time due to a
dissipating surface boundary and passing upper level trough.
Marine layer is trying to reform over the coastal with patchier
cloud cover along the coast and locally inland. A mixed bag of
IFR, MVFR, and VFR. Some locations had cigs earlier and have since
cleared while others had stratus form late. Breezy onshore flow
this afternoon with cigs returning tonight, but mainly Monterey
Bay, the coast, and poss KSFO. Overall conf is low to moderate.

Vicinity of SFO...It took some time earlier in the night, but as
high clouds cleared low clouds in the gap were able to spill over
the terminal. The terminal continues to be on the edge of cigs.
Will keep a BKN deck through 18-19Z.

SFO Bridge Approach...This is one of those situations where the
approaches VFR with no impacts.

Monterey Bay Terminals...Earlier cigs have cleared. Will keep VFR
through 14z-ish. Offshore stratus continues to inch closer and a
late arrival is still possible. Cigs linger into the afternoon
then VFR. Cigs return early tonight.

.MARINE...
(Today through Saturday)
Issued at 233 AM PDT Mon May 26 2025

A weak dry cold front will sweep through the region today. Behind
the front winds will increase out of the north Monday afternoon.
Winds will remain breezy to gusty through Tuesday. The stronger
winds will lead to hazardous conditions with steep wind waves.
Conditions improve midweek before another round of Small Craft
Advisories due to breezy to gusty winds begins late week.
