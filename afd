...New AVIATION, MARINE...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 1207 AM PDT Fri Sep 27 2024

Temperatures will run between 5 and 10 degrees above normal
today. Cooler, more seasonal weather is in store this weekend. The
main story is offshore wind early next week ushering in hotter
and drier weather, elevating fire concerns.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)Stratus continues to bring LIFR conditions to Monterey Bay terminals
this morning, meanwhile it is VFR elsewhere. Stratus this morning
is expected to clear away from the coast towards sunrise as
daytime heating begins. Winds will be generally out of the W/NW in
the afternoon and breezy around 10-12 knots generally. Winds will
ease into the late night of Friday to become light. Stratus will
likely make an appearance late Friday night or early Saturday
morning. However, stratus is not likely to make a meaningful push
into any terminals, with the exception of Monterey Bay towards the
end of the TAF period, bringing IFR/LIFR conditions.

Vicinity of SFO...VFR through the TAF period. Breezy NW winds return
in the afternoon, but ease to become light into the late night
tonight.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...LIFR CIGs and reduced visibilities from
fog/mist persist through sunrise. It is not until closer to the 16-
17Z window that stratus and fog is expected to begin to mix out and
erode. Beyond this timeframe, a return of VFR conditions is
expected, lasting through the evening Friday. Models seem to
indicate that stratus will be late to return, with no CIGs forming
until closer to 11-12Z Saturday.Issued at 1207 AM PDT Fri Sep 27

A high pressure ridge is causing the marine layer to compress to
around 500 ft. Stations south of Santa Cruz within the shallow
marine layer are either under low stratus or dense fog. These
conditions will persist until 8 AM or so when daytime heating
should help the saturated air quickly mix out. The fog hasn`t
impacted stations in the Bay Area yet, but with dew point
depressions continuing to fall, fog may still develop before the
sun comes up. After the fog mixes out, ample sunshine and high
pressure will help contribute to a warm afternoon. Inland
temperatures will reach the mid 90s, which is about 10 degrees
above normal. Coastal areas will be in the 70s and 80s, or about 5
degrees above normal.

.LONG TERM...
(Saturday through Thursday)
Issued at 1207 AM PDT Fri Sep 27 2024

The combination of an upper-level trough moving into the PNW and a
mid-level cut-off low near the Channel Islands will begin to take
a bite out of the ridge by Saturday. This will help to briefly
regulate the temperature this weekend. The lower pressure will
also allow the marine layer depth to rebound from 500 to 1,000
ft, which should limit further dense fog advisories. Overall the
weather will be pretty standard this weekend.

The biggest story of this forecast period arrives Monday and
Tuesday. The ridge will continue to push inland while the Channel
Island low meanders offshore. There is high confidence that the
gradient between these two features will support a period of
weak offshore winds Monday-Tuesday, particularly in the North
Bay. Offshore patterns bring warm weather all the way to the
coast, as well as much drier air. This combination brings elevated
fire weather concerns. Inland areas will reach the low 100s, or
roughly 20 degrees above normal. Most coastal areas have a good
chance to reach 80 degrees Tuesday afternoon, with eastern parts
of San Francisco in the mid 80s and downsloping winds pushing Santa
Cruz in the upper 80s. Meanwhile, the RH will drop into the teens
or lower for the inland hills, drying the fuels to critical
levels. Fortunately the actual wind speed doesn`t look too strong
at the moment, with wind gusts around 10-15 mph. Nevertheless the
hot weather will increase the risk for heat related illness and
elevate fire weather concerns. This pattern should break down by
Wednesday with cooler weather expected to return. The uncertainty
balloons by next weekend, and I can`t give much information about
the longer range weather at this point.

.MARINE...
(Today through Wednesday)
Issued at 427 AM PDT Fri Sep 27 2024

Dense fog is impacting much of Monterey Bay this morning, limiting
visibility down to a quarter of a mile. Fog is expected to improve
beyond sunrise. Fresh northwesterly winds over the northern outer
waters continue through the weekend, with moderate winds
elsewhere. Wave heights will build over the northern outer waters
over the weekend with significant wave heights between 10 to 12
feet expected. Rough seas, and fresh to strong gusts will continue
through the end of the forecast period.
