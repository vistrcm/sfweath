...New AVIATION...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 329 AM PDT Wed Jun 14 2023

Night and morning low clouds clearing back to the coast afternoon
and evening hours. Temperatures will run near or slightly below
normal today with a few degrees of warming inland Thursday through
Saturday as high pressure builds. Long range trends drop another
trough into the Pacific Northwest keeping temperatures below
normal Sunday through the middle of next week as onshore flow
persists.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 329 AM PDT Wed Jun 14 2023

Marine layer is around 2200 feet deep this morning with low clouds
covering most of the Bay Area and spreading down the Salinas
Valley while some high clouds pass overhead. Profiler data shows
some warming at around 3000 feet where temps are around 15-20
celsius which is supported by some of our higher elevations
weather stations that are reporting temperatures in the 60s early
this morning above the marine inversion layer while most of the
Bay Area will wake up to cloudy skies and temps in the 50s. Near
shore sea surface temps have warmed slightly the past few days
with light winds and little or no upwelling, for example the
Monterey Bay buoy is now reporting a 60 sst. Look for low clouds
to clear back to the coast by late morning with pleasant inland
temps warming into the 70s once again with only 80s for the most
interior portions of the Central Coast (think Pinnacles NP).

Expect the marine layer to spread back inland this evening with
steady onshore pressure gradients staying in place and a marine
layer depth around 2000 feet.

.LONG TERM...
(Thursday through Tuesday)
Issued at 329 AM PDT Wed Jun 14 2023

High pressure over the East Pac will slowly nose/build over CA
Thursday through Saturday. This should compress the marine layer
slightly, leading to more fog in the morning with slightly warmer
temps for inland areas during the afternoon. But still looking at
mainly 70s and lower 80s for interior portions of the Bay Area
with no hint of above normal temps for early summer.

By Sunday an abnormally strong trough will develop over the Pac NW
and far Northern California. This will increase onshore winds as
the airmass aloft cools notably. This should setup a tight
pressure gradient off the coast of Cape Mendocino and induce
strong upwelling again across our coastal waters Sunday through at
least the middle of next week. Looking at ECMWF Extreme Forecast
Index we see numbers that support unseasonably cool temps with
breezy onshore winds at least through Tuesday or Weds of next
week. Upshot being no hot weather in site which will keep early
season fire danger in check with Energy Release Components (ERC)
running below normal. If your summer plans take you to the
mountains next week, check the forecasts and plan accordingly for
inclement weather.

7-10 day cluster analysis shows no strong signal for ridging with
West Coast trough most likely through next week. Deterministic
10-15 day model runs show this as well. Good news for keeping the
energy bills down for those that usually run the AC this time of
year.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 440 AM PDT Wed Jun 14 2023

Widespread MVFR-IFR stratus across the region. Expect clearing of
inland terminals by 17-18Z with coastal terminals clearing out
later. A generally northwesterly onshore flow develops this
afternoon with wind speeds up to 10-15 knots. An early return of
MVFR stratus is expected around 2-3Z, with the highest confidence at
the Monterey Bay region, moderate to high confidence in the North
Bay, and lower confidence across the main SF Bay Area terminals.

Vicinity of SFO...MVFR stratus clears to VFR by around 18Z. A
westerly flow develops this afternoon with wind speeds to 12 knots,
gusting to around 15 knots. Moderate confidence (50-60% probability)
that MVFR stratus develops over the terminal this evening, with a
slightly higher confidence at OAK.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...IFR stratus persists through the day with
clearing around 18Z, at least for SNS. Moderate confidence (40-50%
probability) that MRY will clear to VFR, but an MVFR ceiling during
the afternoon is virtually certain (over 90% probability). Stratus
returns early with MVFR ceilings developing at 2-3Z, with a low
confidence for IFR ceilings at this time.

.MARINE...
(Today through Monday)
Issued at 258 AM PDT Wed Jun 14 2023

Gusty northwesterly winds across the northern coastal waters
through Friday with winds building across the waters this weekend.
Gusty afternoon and evening winds each day across the San
Francisco Bay mainly north of the Bay Bridge. Seas will be a mix
of long period southerly swell and shorter period NW swell.

.MTR WATCHES/WARNINGS/ADVISORIES...
CA...None.
PZ...Small Craft Advisory from 3 PM this afternoon to 9 PM PDT this
     evening for PZZ530.

     Gale Warning until 3 AM PDT Thursday for PZZ570.
