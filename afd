...New AVIATION, MARINE...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 232 AM PST Mon Mar 4 2024

As a weak system approaches the Central Coast, overcast skies and
periods of light rain will continue through Wednesday. Thursday
and Friday will be cool, dry and clear, with a moderate northerly
wind. Light rain may return this weekend.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 232 AM PST Mon Mar 4 2024

Technically Monday is a transition day, but that might not be
obvious on the ground. We are wrapping up a 4th day of rain
showers triggered by a cold, Alaskan air mass. Through the day,
winds will begin to shift from northerly to southwesterly as an
approaching low pressure system in the Pacific becomes the
dominant feature. Unfortunately this looks like it will be a
seamless baton pass between the two weather systems, and we wont
get much of a break from overcast skies and some light rain
showers. The shifting winds and higher humidity will bring warmer
overnight temperatures, and frost advisories are not anticipated
for Monday night/Tuesday morning.

.LONG TERM...
(Tuesday through Sunday)
Issued at 232 AM PST Mon Mar 4 2024

Light rain showers will be focused in the North Bay Tuesday
morning and spread southward through Tuesday night. The low
pressure system looks to come ashore somewhere along the Central
Coast on Wednesday, which may trigger a few stronger showers. As
the low continues to push inland, the southerly winds will flip
back to northerly as subtropical high pressure slides into the
driver`s seat. Thursday and Friday look to be the nicest days of
the week with clear skies, mild temperatures and a moderate
northerly breeze. The clouds and rain return with a cold front
expected over the weekend. The current guidance suggest rain will
be light to moderate, and mostly confined to the North Bay. All
rain this week looks to be mostly beneficial, with no widespread
flooding concerns.

Looking way ahead, ensemble guidance and the Climate Prediction
Center are both suggesting we will move out of this cold wet
pattern in mid-March.

Generally VFR with mid- to high-level clouds through the TAF period.
Exception is fog and low stratus observed earlier tonight in the
Russian River valley, impacting STS earlier tonight and potentially
again sometime this morning, although confidence in timing is too
low to include in the TAF. Isolated showers will diminish through
the morning, then a period of dry conditions before showers return
to the North bay and SF Bay area later today into the overnight
period. Breezy southwest to west flow develops this afternoon, with
gusts up to 15-20 knots.

Vicinity of SFO... VFR with mid- to high-level clouds. Light and
variable winds through the morning morning, then breezy southwest
flow developing in the afternoon with gusts up to 15-20 knots.
Isolated showers developing again near the end of the TAF period.

SFO Bridge Approach... Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals... VFR with mid- to high-level clouds. Light
and variable winds tonight, with breezy west winds developing this
afternoon and evening. Next band of showers not expected until after
the end of the TAF period.

and slight chances for storms build later today and last through
