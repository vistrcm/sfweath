...New AVIATION...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 352 AM PST Sat Nov 23 2024

showers forecast across the region today. After many days of wet
weather, drier weather may try to make an appearance mid to late
next week.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 352 AM PST Sat Nov 23 2024

We are moving into a post frontal environment today, which means
showers are forecast to linger across the region. The good news is
that we were able to cancel the following products: the Wind
Advisory, the Flood Watch for the North Bay, the Flood Warning for
south central Sonoma County, and finally the Marin, Sonoma, and Napa
Flood Advisory. Flood Warnings remain in place for central Sonoma
County and on the Russian River at Johnsons Beach at Guerneville. If
traveling in the North Bay today, be on the look out for lingering
flooding and heed any road closure notifications.

In terms of highs, most areas will generally be in the upper 50s to
low 60s, though higher elevations range from the mid 40s to mid 50s.
New rainfall amounts, should a shower pass over should around or
below 0.25". Tonight, chilly temperatures in the 40s will be
realized for much of the region with higher elevations falling into
the mid to upper 30s.

.LONG TERM...
(Sunday through Friday)
Issued at 352 AM PST Sat Nov 23 2024

Cluster analysis shows an upper level low working its way to and
across the PacNW through the early portion of the work week.
Scattered showers are forecast from Sunday through Wednesday, with
models varying some on timing and placement of these batches of
rain. Total rainfall amounts for this period generally remain the
same, around 0.5 inches to 2.0 inches for the Bay Area, 1.0 to 2.0
inches for Central Coast, and 2.0 to 3.0 inches for the Santa
Lucias. Cluster analysis continues to both ridging over the eastern
Pacific and some troughing as well. Current thinking is there should
be at least brief period of dry weather late Wednesday into Friday;
however, confidence remains a bit low on that due to the differences
in the clusters and models. Looking beyond in the 6-10 day outlook
from the CPC, we look to be near normal temperatures and have below
normal chances for precipitation.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 400 AM PST Sat Nov 23 2024

Conditions continue to improve at all terminals this morning in a
post-frontal regime.  Generally speaking cigs range from 2-4k feet
with pockets of clear.  KMUX radar also shows some lingering
showers. These showers will be handled mostly by VCSH or not in
TAF due to very low confidence. Tonight will feature a very
moisture low level boundary layer. Some prob guidance shows patchy
fog. At this point will only include fog for KSTS, but will need
to watch for others.

Vicinity of SFO...VFR with SW flow light to moderate. Hi-res
guidance does show a low chance for afternoon showers passing
through, but conf is too low for inclusion in TAF. Winds will
switch to light SE overnight.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...VFR with a few passing showers with in 10
miles of terminals.
