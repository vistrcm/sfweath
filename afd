...New UPDATE, MARINE...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 1219 AM PDT Tue Apr 22 2025

Generally quiescent weather persists through the week. Warm
conditions continue today, with a cooling trend through the rest of
the week. Light rain and drizzle are possible Friday and Saturday.

&&

.UPDATE...
Issued at 913 AM PDT Tue Apr 22 2025

Adjusted the cloud cover to try and reflect the current status of
the stratus across the Bay Area and Central Coast. Watching
satellite you can see hints of the cloud cover mixing out along
the edges in the valleys. Guidance still indicates clearing at
most locations perhaps as early as later this morning, but perhaps
closer to the afternoon hours. Opted for the more optimistic
trend, with lower confidence around the Monterey Bay area and
north Salinas Valley. Should stratus linger, the high temperature
forecast could be at risk.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 1219 AM PDT Tue Apr 22 2025

Satellite imagery is showing coastal stratus moving as far north as
the Marin Headlands, with the stratus moving inland across the
Monterey Bay region and down the Salinas Valley, while an isolated
patch develops near Berkeley. Stratus will continue to develop
inland through the rest of the night, before mixing out through the
morning. Patchy dense fog is possible along the coast and across the
coastal valleys.

Today marks the last day of warm temperatures in the region with
high temperatures ranging from the middle 70s to the lower 80s in
the inland valleys, the middle 60s to the lower 70s along San
Francisco Bay, and the upper 50s to the lower 60s along the Pacific
coast. A gentle to moderate onshore breeze will develop this
afternoon, which will be enhanced in the later part of the day as a
shortwave trough develops over the West Coast, leading to light but
still perceptible onshore flow overnight.

&&

.LONG TERM...
(Wednesday through Monday)
Issued at 1219 AM PDT Tue Apr 22 2025

A cooling trend begins across the region as an upper level trough
approaches and deepens across the eastern Pacific. The models
continue to converge on the general upper level pattern, but differ
on the strength of the incoming trough, with some of the model
solutions (particularly the European ensemble model members) leaning
towards a more vigorous trough or perhaps a cutoff low across the
West Coast. Robust onshore flow and widespread stratus will develop
on Wednesday and Thursday, with a few hours of clearing in the
afternoon and gusts reaching 25 to 30 mph through the gaps and
passes. Friday and Saturday will be the coolest days, with highs
coming in around 5 to 10 degrees below the seasonal averages. The
inland valleys will see highs in the lower to middle 60s while
coastal regions will hover in the middle 50s to the lower 60s. Light
rain and drizzle will also be possible on those two days, although
the expected pattern of rainfall is still somewhat unclear. The
stronger model solutions suggest more extensive coverage of light
rain across the Bay Area and Central Coast, while the majority of
the other models show rain confined to the North Bay. Have continued
to lean on the deterministic NBM solution, which does focus the PoPs
across the North Bay.

Ridging should return after the trough moved out, with daytime highs
rebounding to near the seasonal average in the early part of next
week.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 505 AM PDT Tue Apr 22 2025

Low CIGs continue along the coast and around the Monterey Bay as
well as APC, with fog affecting STS and HAF. These CIGs look to last
into the mid to late morning before eroding or scattering. Winds
increase into the afternoon becoming moderate for most areas, but
lean on the breezy side around the SF Bay. These winds reduce into
the evening with IFR CIGs returning to the coast and around the
Monterey Bay. CIGs will continue to push slowly farther inland later
into the night, but look to fill for the SF Bay terminals into
early Wednesday.

Vicinity of SFO...VFR lasts into early Wednesday. Expect mostly light
to moderate winds through the morning before breezy to gusty west
winds build in the mid afternoon. Gusts reduce into the night, but
winds will stay moderate. IFR CIGs fill around the SF Bay into early
Wednesday, and don`t look to erode until closer to noon that day.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...LIFR/IFR CIGs are affecting the Monterey
Bay with some reductions in visibilities due to mist and fog. Winds
stay light until the late morning, before more moderate winds
arrive, which will allow CIGs to erode. These winds reduce into the
evening as IFR CIGs return.

&&

.MARINE...
(Today through Sunday)
Issued at 913 AM PDT Tue Apr 22 2025

Strong northwesterly winds over the outer waters will continue
through Wednesday with gale force gusts expected over the
northern outer waters. Rough seas will be expected in the outer
waters through Wednesday. Moderate northwesterly winds and
moderate seas will prevail Thursday through Saturday with a chance
for light rain or drizzle Friday.
