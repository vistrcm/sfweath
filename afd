.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 219 AM PDT Mon Oct 9 2023

An approaching cold front will bring cooler temperatures,
overcast skies and some rain today. A second front will keep rain
in the area through Tue night. Wed will be windy following the
second front. Thu-Fri will be dry and return to near normal
temperatures before the next cold front arrives this weekend.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 219 AM PDT Mon Oct 9 2023

There has been some fluctuation in the rainfall forecast with the
expected amount increasing overnight after decreasing on Sunday`s
forecast. As the system has moved into view of the neighboring
Radar in Eureka, CA, the models should stabilize and the forecasts
will get more precise as the day goes on. Speaking of the Radar
signature, the main band approaching far northern California looks
quite healthy this morning with composite reflectivity in the
35-50 dBZ range. This will likely look much less impressive when
it gets in range of the Oakland Radar as the IR satellite doesn`t
show the deep convective clouds firing along the southern portion
of the front. Cloud top temperatures approaching northern
California are -40C to -50C and only near freezing approaching
the central coast, indicating they are much shallower. The current
forecast calls for about 1/10th of an inch in the North Bay on
Monday. Less than 1/10" of rain is expected in coastal areas down
to the Monterey Bay. Rain should stop by Mon night with another
round expected Tuesday.

.LONG TERM...
(Tuesday through Sunday)
Issued at 219 AM PDT Mon Oct 9 2023

A developing storm force low in the central North Pacific is
moving quickly towards the NE Pacific. This will bring another
cold front to the Bay area Tuesday afternoon. A second round of
light rain is likely to begin around mid-day Tuesday and last
through late Tuesday/early Wednesday. The impacted areas are
similar to Monday`s event, though the expected accumulation is
slightly less.

This second cold front is moving fast. Post frontal NW winds will
be fresh across the area Wednesday. Winds will be strong to near
gale force over the water and in the mountains. There is some
discrepancy in the models regarding the wind strength, and the
forecast confidence is pretty low at the moment. Fortunately the
humidities will be elevated following multiple cold front
passages, limiting fire weather concerns during the stronger
winds.

Things will calm down Thursday through Friday with lighter winds
and near normal temperatures. The next system looks to bring light
rain to the region on Saturday.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 409 AM PDT Mon Oct 9 2023

Mostly MVFR ceilings are in place for the terminals this morning
as the marine layer deepens to around 2000 feet. Light southerly
winds will prevail ahead of a cold front this morning, with
onshore winds developing along the coast during the afternoon.
Scattered light showers are possible ahead of the front during the
late morning to mid afternoon hours for the Bay Area terminals.
Impacts appear minimal, but brief sub-VFR conditions are possible
should a shower directly impact an airfield. Improvement to VFR-
MVFR later this afternoon with ceiling development/redevelopment
likely for the coastal terminals early this evening.

Vicinity of SFO...Low clouds have finally reached the terminal.
It`s possible observations continue bouncing between VFR and MVFR,
with a trend towards MVFR anticipated this morning. Expect
westerly winds early this morning to back more S-SE through the
late morning to early afternoon hours. Somewhat lower confidence
in exact timing, but a switch more towards the SW should occur
around/before 00Z Tuesday. Speeds should remain light at
generally 10 kt or less. Ceilings gradually improving to VFR-MVFR
this afternoon, with a likely return to IFR around/after 00Z
Tuesday.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to KSFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...The region remains socked in with IFR-
MVFR clouds. This condition should persist through late morning
with afternoon improvement to MVFR-VFR as the marine layer
deepens. Light onshore winds with a few light showers this
afternoon. confidence in airfield impacts is too low for
inclusion in the TAFs, and any impacts (if realized) should be
quite minimal. Medium to high confidence in sub-VFR ceilings
redeveloping around/after 00Z Tuesday.

.MARINE...
(Today through Saturday)
Issued at 409 AM PDT Mon Oct 9 2023

A cold front will approach the northern waters this morning
causing a wind shift from southerly to north-northwesterly early
this evening. Scattered rain showers will accompany the front
today. Stronger northerly winds will arrive on Tuesday into
Wednesday with fresh to strong northerly breezes developing.
Elevated seas are expected as a 9 to 11 foot moderate period
northwest swell arrives on Tuesday. The combined winds and seas
will result in hazardous conditions for small craft operators for
mid to late week.

.MTR WATCHES/WARNINGS/ADVISORIES...
CA...None.
PZ...Small Craft Advisory from 3 AM to 3 PM PDT Wednesday for PZZ540-
     560-570-575.

     Small Craft Advisory from 9 AM Tuesday to 3 PM PDT Wednesday for
