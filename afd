...New AVIATION, MARINE...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 109 AM PDT Wed Oct 25 2023

Cooler temperatures arrive today with small chances for light rain
or drizzle for the Bay Area tonight. Temperatures remain cool into
late week with breezy conditions at times. More clouds and perhaps
another shot at light rain or drizzle on Friday into Friday night.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 109 AM PDT Wed Oct 25 2023

A low pressure system moving onshore to our north will migrate
through the Pacific Northwest region as an attendant surface cold
front drops south through the Bay Area into tonight. Moisture with
the front appears rather meager, so only small chances for very
light rain and/or drizzle are anticipated mainly from the Golden
Gate north. Amounts will be light and on the order of a few
hundredths of an inch or less for most. Breezy northwest winds will
accompany the frontal system with afternoon/evening gusts of 20-30
mph in the usually windier spots such as gaps, summits, and passes.
Coastal profilers suggest some modest deepening of the marine layer
has occurred with its ceiling around 1500 feet. This should keep low
stratus clouds in place through the mid to late morning hours,
although the may start to mix out some from north to south as the
frontal system approaches. Patchy fog should be around this morning
as well, with locally dense spots possible in the North Bay valleys.
This will be the start of a multiday cooldown, and afternoon highs
will only top out in the 60s to around 70 for most. With late night
clearing expect a chilly night with North Bay lows dipping into the
upper 30s to lower 40s. Still looks a bit too warm for frost
formation, but it`s a reminder that we`re getting into that time of
year. Lows across the remainder of the region should range from
around 50 along the coast to the mid to upper 40s inland.

.LONG TERM...
(Thursday through Tuesday)
Issued at 109 AM PDT Wed Oct 25 2023

Thursday:

Cool post-frontal conditions are anticipated. Highs will generally
be in the 60s. With near-calm winds this will be a good radiational
cooling night with interior lows dipping into the upper 30s and 40s.
The urban and coastal areas will be a bit warmer with lows in the
upper 40s to lower 50s.

Friday through Sunday:

Cyclonic flow will encompass much of the western CONUS with a
longwave trough progressing through the region. A cold front will
move through the Bay Area on Friday night with little fanfare. While
previous forecasts did bring some light rain with this, the
potential appears to be waning. Can`t rule out a little bit of light
rain or drizzle, but impacts should be minimal to none in the
precipitation department. By Saturday strong high pressure centers
over the Northern Rockies as the pressure gradient tightens across
the Sierra. A modest push of offshore flow looks to take place on
Saturday night into Sunday morning but fire weather concerns appear
minimal given recent rainfall and moisture. Initially cool
temperatures on Friday should rise towards seasonal averages over
the weekend.

Early Next Week:

A shortwave ridge aloft should set up over the region bringing dry
conditions and slightly warmer temperatures. However the pattern
appears a bit more unsettled towards mid week as upstream troughing
approaches the region from the Pacific.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 501 AM PDT Wed Oct 25 2023

Currently seeing VFR at all TAF sites with the exception of STS and
SNS. Winds are breezy and onshore in the bay areas and calm in the
valleys. Confidence has been raised as it seems that terminals that
have not had a ceiling develop yet tonight are now out of the woods.
With the incoming cold front, the marine layer has deepened, so if
ceilings were to develop they should be MVFR. The cold front that
will pass over the region later today will begin to dry, keeping
chances for light drizzle mainly in STS; however, it is not out of
the question for the other TAF sites.

Vicinity of SFO...Currently VFR with a westerly breeze. Winds will
remain westerly and breezy before picking back up by about 17Z this
afternoon. Winds will begin to diminish by about 12Z tomorrow
morning. There is medium confidence now that SFO will not develop a
ceiling this morning as there have been no signals that have
increased the probability. As for precipitation, the cold front will
begin to dry up as it approaches the area, so while light drizzle is
not completely ruled out, it will not amount to a lot and should not
bring any reductions to visibilities.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...Currently seeing light onshore breezes at
both terminals with SNS seeing MVFR conditions and MRY seeing VFR
conditions, although stratus is expected to make a push back over
the terminal. With the incoming cold front and the subsequent
deepening of the marine layer, MVFR ceilings should be clearing by
about 17Z. Winds will stay onshore and light until the afternoon
when they become breezy and westerly. Tomorrow afternoon winds will
peak at about 11 knots for Monterey and about 14 knots for
Salinas.

.MARINE...
(Today through Monday)
Issued at 501 AM PDT Wed Oct 25 2023

Winds and waves gradually diminishing for most areas into
tonight. Gusty winds return for the latter half of the week as a
cold front moves through the local waters. This will bring a
continuation of hazardous conditions for small craft operators.

.MTR WATCHES/WARNINGS/ADVISORIES...
CA...None.
PZ...Small Craft Advisory from 3 PM this afternoon to 9 PM PDT this
     evening for PZZ535-560.

     Small Craft Advisory until 9 AM PDT this morning for PZZ540-545-
     570-575.

     Small Craft Advisory until 9 AM PDT Thursday for PZZ565.
