.LONG TERM...
(Saturday through Thursday)
Issued at 350 AM PDT Fri Mar 21 2025

Zonal flow gives way to upper level ridging building late Saturday
into Sunday, which will be the start of the gradual warming trend.
High pressure continues to build and then hold through early next
week, leading to high temperatures being 5 to 15 degrees above
normal on Monday and Tuesday. The pattern begins to change late
Tuesday into Wednesday as upper level troughing develops over the
eastern Pacific. Cluster analysis and deterministic models favor a
more PacNW solution with rain chances for us favoring the North Bay
at this time from Wed through Friday. There`s still uncertainty on
timing and placement with this system so stay tuned to the forecast
for updates.

Looking beyond Day 7, the  CPC outlooks still highlight
leaning above normal chances for precipitation. Deterministic and
ensemble guidance favors a late March/early April shot at rain.
Given this is even more out in time there is still a lot time for
things to change, so be sure to check back as we get closer towards
the end of the month.
