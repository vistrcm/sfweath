.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 350 AM PDT Tue Jun 20 2023

Broad troughing pattern persists aloft. This will maintain breezy
winds through mid-week coupled with below normal daytime highs.
Slight warming today and Wednesday followed by a cool down on
Thursday when an upper low develops directly over the Bay Area.
Coastal drizzle possible for Thursday into Friday with increasing
cloud cover for mid to late week.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 350 AM PDT Tue Jun 20 2023

With the marine layer mixed out, nighttime satellite imagery is
showing fairly clear skies across our CWA. There are a few patches
of marine stratus over the SF Peninsula and then another patch
between Milpitas & Pleasanton in the East Bay. Down in Central CA,
a small patch of stratus is sitting to the Southwest of the
Monterey Airport. With these patches of stratus, folks could see
some partly cloudy conditions at the start of their day. However,
we are not expecting a widespread blanket of low coastal clouds to
develop and transition inland.

Temperatures as of 3 am were in the upper 40s to mid 50s across
the CWA (warmest inland). Winds are showing a diminished trend
compared to 24 hours ago. The SFO-SAC onshore pressure gradient
was 1.6 mb at 3 am compared to the 3.5 mb yesterday at the same
time. Though winds won`t be as strong this afternoon/evening,
models still indicate an enhanced onshore gradient later today
which will create breezy conditions at 15 to 30 mph. Highs today
will be similar to a touch warmer than yesterday with 70s inland
and 60s at the coast.

.LONG TERM...
(Wednesday through Monday)
Issued at 350 AM PDT Tue Jun 20 2023

Though a general troughing/upper low pattern will persist
throughout the 7 day forecast, conditions will be fairly dry with
below normal temperatures. However, coastal drizzle is possible.
Temperatures may not oscillate much this week beyond a range of
5-10 degrees, but models are consistent that Thursday should be
the coolest day. That`s when the general troughing pattern
transitions into a closed upper low aloft for Thursday into
Friday. This pattern will keep temperatures on the cool side,
deepen the marine layer, and bring a return to more coastal
clouds. The marine layer also appears sufficiently deep for some
drizzle to ensue during the late week as well. Expect onshore
winds to enhance again on Thursday as the GFS and NAM indicate
that the onshore gradient will rise up to around 4 mb. Slight
warming is expected over the weekend into early next week with
highs peaking in the mid 70s to low 80s inland...but temperatures
will still be 5-10 degrees below normal.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 421 AM PDT Tue Jun 20 2023

Marine layer remains nearly completely mixed out this morning as
the upper low continues to sit over the region. Satellite only
showing limited stratus development near coastal regions of the SF
peninsula. Skies expected to remain clear once again today with
VFR through the bulk of the TAF period for most terminals. Another
gusty day ahead today with NW/onshore flow generally 10-15 kts
with gusts to 20. Winds diminish into the evening hours and
expecting some return of cloud cover tonight as gradients relax
and the marine layer is able to reform. Some degree of limited
moisture should keep stratus confined to coastal areas overnight
tonight into Wednesday morning.

Vicinity of SFO...Small patch of stratus cover should remain west
of the terminal this morning, allowing VFR through the day today.
Gusty W/NW winds this afternoon 25-30 kts, diminishing through the
evening hours. The aforementioned return of cloud cover is a low
confidence scenario for SFO, as much of the stratus tonight should
stay mostly confined to the coastal areas. Nevertheless, will
likely see at least some degree of cloud cover into the SF Bay
Area overnight tonight as the atmosphere stratifies and the marine
layer reforms.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...Clear skies and VFR through the day with
stratus remaining mostly offshore this morning. Gusty NW winds
this afternoon 12-18 kts, diminishing through the evening hours.
Return of stratus expected into early Wednesday morning with MVFR
cigs along coastal areas.

.MARINE...
Issued at 300 AM PDT Tue Jun 20 2023

Strong and gusty northwesterly winds with occasional gale force
gusts persist across the coastal waters through this afternoon as
a deep upper level low and dry surface cold front move over the
region. Occasional gale force gusts developing this afternoon and
evening at the immediate coast between Point Arena and Point
Reyes, near the Golden Gate, between Davenport and Point Pinos
including within Monterey Bay, and south of Point Sur. Breezy
northwest winds will continue Wednesday through Friday with low
pressure along the West Coast. Long period southerly swell and
shorter period northwesterly swell persists through the weekend.
