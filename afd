.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 204 AM PST Sun Dec 8 2024

Slightly cooler conditions today before breezier conditions begin on
Monday. Chilly temperatures are expected Monday and Tuesday morning
with widespread inland lows in the 30s. Chances for light rain
increase midweek, with the best chances for accumulating rain Friday
into the next weekend.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 204 AM PST Sun Dec 8 2024

High clouds, haze, and patches of fog blanket the region as a weak
cold front comes through the region. No appreciable precipitation is
expected tonight, as low temperatures drop into the low to mid 40s
in the coldest interior valleys, up to near 50 along the coast. High
clouds will clear out through the day, but linger into the evening
hours, contributing to a slightly cooler day today with the interior
valleys reaching the upper 60s, with the coastal and Bayshore
regions seeing highs in the lower to middle 60s and the higher
elevations in the middle to upper 50s.

.LONG TERM...
(Monday through Saturday)
Issued at 204 AM PST Sun Dec 8 2024

Later on Sunday into Monday, a shortwave trough over British
Columbia deepens as it digs into the intermountain West, combining
with a high pressure system over the Great Basin to create favorable
conditions for gusty offshore winds in the North Bay interior
Mountains, East Bay Hills, and Santa Cruz Mountains. Gusts in the
North Bay interior mountains reach 30-40 mph, especially in eastern
Napa County, while those in the East Bay and Santa Cruz Mountains
reach 20-30 mph. Widespread fire weather concerns are not expected,
although dry conditions continue in the interior Central Coast.

Clear skies will return to the region as upper level ridging takes
hold. High temperatures remain relatively similar through the
midweek, with a slight cooling across the North Bay into the
northern San Francisco Bay Area on Tuesday. With the clear skies
promoting more radiational cooling late Monday into Tuesday, low
temperatures reach the low to mid 30s in the inland valleys, with
the coldest temperatures taking hold in the Sonoma County valleys
and southern Monterey County; temperatures below freezing are
expected in areas close to the border with San Luis Obispo County.
Confidence in the necessity of a Frost Advisory continues to
increase, and one is likely to be issued sometime later today. Low
temperatures will warm up through the rest of the week as high
clouds return to limit radiational cooling.

The forecast looks a lot more interesting towards the latter part of
the week as rain chances reenter the picture. Some scattered rain
chances arrive later Wednesday into Thursday, with the possible
arrival of a shortwave trough. Confidence is quite low, given that
the European ensemble model mean shows the shortwave coming into the
West Coast, while the American and Canadian ensemble means showing
zonal flow continuing through the period. In contrast, confidence is
increasing for an upper level low coming to the western United
States on Friday into the next weekend. It`s a little too far out to
place much faith in forecast storm totals, but as things stand,
significant rainfall is possible across the North Bay. Speaking
probabilistically for a moment, for the period from 4 AM Friday to 4
AM Sunday, there`s a 40-60% probability of at least 1 inch of rain
across the North Bay, with the highest probabilities in the higher
elevations of Sonoma and northern Napa Counties, while probabilities
for 1 inch of rain across the northern San Mateo Peninsula, the
Santa Cruz Mountains, and the Santa Lucia range range from 20% to
40%. It`s a good reminder that we are entering the climatic peak of
our rainy season, and to expect more storms as the pattern gets more
active.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 432 AM PST Sun Dec 8 2024

High clouds are blanketing the area as a weak cold front moves
through. The latest balloon measured these cloud bases at just
over 20,000 feet. Foggy conditions will persist through the late
morning in the North Bay. With light winds and a strong
inversion, haze may drop the visibility to MVFR at times,
especially for the valley terminals.

Vicinity of SFO...The visibility has been variable at SFO with
some combination of haze and mist. MVFR conditions are likely as
the dew point depression is now down to 1C on the latest
observation. As the diurnal winds increase, the visibility will
improve, and VFR conditions will prevail for the remainder of the
TAF period under high clouds.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...Fairly high confidence that VFR
conditions will persist through the afternoon, however SNS may
develop some haze issues if the winds don`t pick up. A drying
trend should help keep VFR conditions in place overnight.

&&

.MARINE...
(Today through Friday)
Issued at 432 AM PST Sun Dec 8 2024

As a cold front moves through the coastal waters, strong
northerly winds and rough seas will continue through the day.
Winds will decrease substantially overnight, allowing seas to
abate by mid-day Monday. Gentle, shifting wind and a moderate NW
swell will persist through the remainder of next week.

&&

.MTR WATCHES/WARNINGS/ADVISORIES...

     for CAZ506-510-513>516-518-528.
