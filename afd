...New AVIATION, MARINE...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 108 AM PDT Sun Sep 8 2024

A few more days of above average temperatures region-wide before a
cool down occurs on Tuesday in response to an upper level trough
digging into the Pacific Northwest.

&&

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 108 AM PDT Sun Sep 8 2024

Only subtle cooling will occur this afternoon with high temperatures
forecast to be in the mid 80`s to mid 90`s across the interior, 70`s
and 80`s around the Bay Shoreline, and 60`s and 70`s near the coast.
The warmest interior parts of the Central Coast will warm between
100 and 105 degrees. This slight "cool down" is in response to a
mid/upper level through impacting the northern half of the region.

Tonight, the marine layer will deepen slightly with further inland
penetration of low stratus into the coastal adjacent valleys. Patchy
fog is also expected once again over night, especially near the
coast and in the North Bay valleys. Temperatures will drop into the
low to upper 50`s across much of the region, near 60 degrees across
the Santa Clara Valley and interior East Bay, and 60`s to upper 70`s
in the higher peaks of the Central Coast.

&&

.LONG TERM...
(Monday through Saturday)
Issued at 108 AM PDT Sun Sep 8 2024

Monday will cool down by a few degrees, especially across the
interior as 500mb heights lower and the airmass aloft cools.
However, temperatures will remain above seasonal averages again on
Monday. Onshore flow will persists and deepen the marine layer to
around 1,500 feet in depth by Monday night.

A more pronounced upper level trough will drop into the Pacific
Northwest by Tuesday and Wednesday. This will drop temperatures back
to near or below seasonal averages with mid 70`s to mid 80`s across
the interior and more widespread 60`s at the coast. Some offshore
flow is possible as the low shifts across the Intermountain West on
Thursday, especially in the higher elevations. However, it does not
appear to be a great setup for stronger offshore winds.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 513 AM PDT Sun Sep 8 2024

Patchy fog is developing throughout the North Bay and Central Coast
with visibilities down to 1/4SM observed in the last hour. Fog
coverage remains fairly patchy in nature with temporary improvements
in visibility possible, however, visibilities are generally expected
to be poor and less than 1SM. Night Fog shows stratus developing
over the SF Bay with low level clouds expected to fill in over OAK
and SFO within the next 1 to 2 hours. Low to moderate confidence
that patchy stratus will reach SJC with Night Fog showing stratus
currently filtering into the South Bay. Fog and stratus coverage
should dissipate by 16-18Z with a return to VFR conditions during
the afternoon/evening. Stratus is expected to return again this
evening but confidence remains low on the exact timing as models
have been consistently forecasting too early arrivals for the past
few days. Light and variable winds persist through late morning with
more moderate west to northwest winds returning during the
afternoon/evening.

Vicinity of SFO...Stratus is filtering in over the SF Bay and across
the SF peninsula. Current thinking is stratus and IFR CIGs will
reach SFO by 13Z with ensemble guidance indicating 12-14Z as the
most likely stratus arrival timeframe. CIGs will be on the IFR-LIFR
border with other sites reporting CIGs around 300 to 400 ft. Stratus
is expected to clear by late morning with VFR conditions through the
late evening when stratus and IFR CIGs return. Moderate northwest
winds persist with gusts up to 25 knots possible during the
afternoon/evening.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...Patchy dense fog is being reported in the
Monterey Bay region. Visibilities at both MRY and SNS have been
fluctuating up and down over the last few hours with visibilities as
low as 1/4SM reported. Patchy fog is expected to persist through the
late morning with VFR conditions returning after it dissipates.
Looking at an early stratus return this evening with low to moderate
confidence on the exact timing. Lighter variable to slightly
offshore flow will continue through the morning hours before
moderate northwest winds return during the afternoon/evening.

&&

.MARINE...
(Today through Friday)
Issued at 513 AM PDT Sun Sep 8 2024

Moderate northerly to northwesterly winds continue through the
weekend with occasionally gusty winds over the southern waters. An
upper level low pressure system will arrive midweek bringing
widespread fresh to strong northwesterly winds and elevated wave
heights across the coastal waters. Unsettled conditions will then
persist through the end of the week as a second upper level low
arrives next weekend.

&&

.MTR WATCHES/WARNINGS/ADVISORIES...
CA...Dense Fog Advisory until 9 AM PDT this morning for CAZ528>530.

PZ...Dense Fog Advisory until 9 AM PDT this morning for Mry Bay.
