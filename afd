.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 1205 AM PST Sat Feb 24 2024

A pleasant weather weekend ahead with no rain, only light winds
and warm afternoon temperatures. A weak system will likely bring
some rain back on Monday. Dry again for mid week with rain
returning late week into next weekend.

&&

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 1207 AM PST Sat Feb 24 2024

High pressure aloft will remain centered over Mexico with the
corresponding ridge axis extending into the central Great Basin. A
closed upper low will hold court offshore from CA. Meanwhile surface
high pressure will center over the Great Basin while promoting light
offshore flow today. High clouds across the area early this morning
should thin out a bit today and allow for a decent amount of
afternoon sunshine. Mild daytime readings will ensue as afternoon
highs climb into the upper 60s to lower 70s area-wide. By tonight
the trough will gain greater influence over the area with onshore
flow developing. This will result in more coastal stratus along with
areas of fog, particularly in the North Bay. Lows will be seasonal
and in the 40s.

.LONG TERM...
(Sunday through Friday)
Issued at 1207 AM PST Sat Feb 24 2024

Sunday and Monday:

Look for increasing clouds and cooler temperatures on Sunday, with a
weak weather system impacting the region on Monday. Rain amounts
from this system still appear rather meager, and storm total rain
amounts have trended lower. Look for rain amounts of a tenth of an
inch or less for most areas, with up to a quarter inch possible for
the Santa Lucias and Santa Cruz Mountains. Temperatures will be
seasonal, with highs in the lower to mid 60s and lows in the 40s.

Tuesday and Wednesday:

High pressure will bring dry conditions, northerly winds, and cooler
temperatures. Look for highs in the upper 50s to around 60, with
lows in the upper 30s to lower 40s.

Thursday and Friday:

A closed upper low will migrate south from the Gulf of Alaska to
just offshore from the Pacific Northwest states. A leading surface
front will trek south towards NorCal by late week, bringing a
resulting uptick in rain chances. So far the moisture tap with this
system doesn`t appear overly impressive (precipitable water values
around 0.8" per the deterministic GFS), but we are expecting rain to
continue beyond this time.

Next Weekend and Beyond:

Precipitation chances will extend into next weekend. The latest
Climate Prediction Center threats outlook now keeps the greatest
heavy rain potential north of Santa Rosa, but we`ll keep watching
trends. Expect colder temperatures and lowering snow levels so some
of our higher peaks may get in on some snow action as well. Stay
tuned as the details become clearer...

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 327 AM PST Sat Feb 24 2024

VFR through a majority of the TAF period with stratus looking to
make a return towards the end. With the exception of APC and STS,
winds will become onshore this afternoon.

Vicinity of SFO...Currently VFR and calm. Winds will become westerly
this afternoon and become southerly going into the overnight hours.
Stratus looks to make a return to the area, although looks to remain
above the MVFR threshold ceiling wise.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...Currently VFR with breezy drainage flow at
both terminals. Winds become onshore this afternoon, helping to
return stratus to both terminals towards the end of the TAF
period.

.MARINE...
(Today through Thursday)
Issued at 327 AM PST Sat Feb 24 2024

High pressure will allow for generally favorable conditions to
persist through the weekend. A cold front will bring a strong NNW
breeze and hazardous, rough seas to the coastal waters by Monday
afternoon. Light rain will primarily be exclusive from the Golden
Gate southward.
