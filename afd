...New UPDATE...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 300 AM PST Sat Feb 10 2024

An area of high pressure will result in benign weather this
weekend into early next week with chilly mornings continuing.
Unsettled weather is expected to return for the latter half of the
upcoming work week lasting through next weekend at least.

&&

.UPDATE...
Issued at 832 AM PST Sat Feb 10 2024

Mostly clear skies and relatively light winds led to another
frosty/chilly start to the day. While the coast and urban areas
were spared from the coldest temperatures it is still chilly with
temps in the upper 30s to mid 40s. Interior locations on the
other hand plummeted in the mid and lower 30s. Even saw a few
spots in dip into the upper 20s across southern Monterey/San
Benito. Frost Advisory will remain through 9 AM.

After the chilly start, today will end up being a pleasant with
sunshine and temperatures in the upper 50 and 60s - or close to
seasonal averages for early February.

No update needed.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 300 AM PST Sat Feb 10 2024

Coastal Flood Advisory remains posted for areas adjacent to the San
Francisco Bay until 1 PM PST this afternoon. Additionally, a Frost
Advisory remains in effect until 9 AM PST this morning for interior
parts of the Central Coast and Eastern Santa Clara Hills.

Today, expecting mainly clear sky conditions with temperatures
ranging from the upper 50s to lower 60s regionwide (40s for the
peaks). This is as a ridge of high pressure continues to build
eastward over the region. Tonight, temperatures will cool into the
low-to-mid 30s across the interior portions of the Central Coast and
Eastern Santa Clara Hills where Frost Advisories have been posted
once again for tonight/tomorrow morning. Elsewhere, expecting
mid/upper 30s to mid 40s.

&&

.LONG TERM...
(Sunday through next Thursday)
Issued at 1217 PM PST Fri Feb 9 2024

Ridging persists into Sunday, making for a nice day for any
game day BBQs or parties you may have on the calendar with highs
in the upper 50s to low 60s with mostly sunny skies and light
winds.

By early next week, the 500 mb ridge will deamplify and the upper
level flow will start to become more zonal. Ensemble guidance is
in moderate agreement on this solution (with about a third of ensemble
solutions show ridging persisting through the whole week, so
there`s still uncertainty). If the pattern becomes more zonal by
midweek, it will set the stage for the next round of unsettled,
wet weather (opening the "storm door") as early as late Wed-
Thurs. This initial round of rain would be a result of a quick-
moving upper level disturbance, bringing light rain to the region.
NBM features a 20-30% chance of over 0.5" for the N Bay and
coastal mountains and less for surrounding areas.

Ensemble models come into better agreement by the weekend with the
arrival of a strong upper low, giving more confidence to the
possibility of widespread and potentially more impactful rain and
wind. Details remain fuzzy as we are still a week plus out from
this event. However, Climate Prediction Center does again
highlight the entire state of CA for high likelihood of above
average precip from Feb 17-23 (8-14 day outlook). Stay tuned!
Winter is certainly not over yet.
