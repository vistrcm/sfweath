.UPDATE...
Issued at 922 AM PDT Fri Sep 5 2025

Stratus is starting to recede across the interior with cloud cover
likely to dissipate by late morning into the early afternoon. Some
coastal drizzle was observed this morning with several sites across
the Bay Area reporting one to two hundredths of drizzle this
morning. Otherwise, the forecast remains on track with high
temperatures in the 70s to mid 80s across the interior and 60s along
the coastline.

.SHORT TERM...
Issued at 1214 AM PDT Fri Sep 5 2025
(Today and tonight)

A deep marine layer is bringing extensive stratus coverage across
the CWA. Some measurable drizzle has been reported along the
North Bay coast, with more to come through the morning. The
overall pattern is dominated by a slow moving trough off the coast
that will bring a cooling trend with continued marine layer
clouds and coastal drizzle Saturday morning.

.LONG TERM...
Issued at 1214 AM PDT Fri Sep 5 2025
(Saturday through Thursday)

The pattern is dominated by a building trough off the coast
through the middle of next week. There is a competing ridge over
northern Mexico that will likely make some impact this weekend
before troughing takes back over. As this trough slowly deepens
and pushes closer to the coast, 850 temps will fall from 21C
(75th percentile) measured on the latest balloon, to around 12C
(10th percentile) by Tuesday. Moisture will also be higher than
normal with a notable push of PW over 1" on Monday followed by an
early season cold front and upper level trough axis on Tuesday.
This combination will bring a good chance for light rain,
especially to the North Bay, starting Monday. There is also a
slight chance for stronger convection or even thunderstorms when
the cold upper air moves in on Tuesday. Model support is meager at
the moment, but the ingredients are there and it`s worth keeping
an eye on. The chance for precipitation is increasing, but exact
amounts remain uncertain. Most likely we`ll see a few locations
north of Golden Gate record 1/10" or more, with more novelty rain
further south. There is more confidence is the temperature
forecast, with highs dropping 5-10 degrees below normal by early
next week.
