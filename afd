...New UPDATE, MARINE, and FIRE WEATHER...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 339 AM PDT Wed Oct 2 2024

Hot and dry conditions continue with dangerous heat and elevated
fire weather concerns area-wide. Gradual decline in temperatures
by the end of the work week, with potentially critical fire weather
conditions today through Thursday across portions of the interior
Central Coast.

.UPDATE...
Issued at 915 AM PDT Wed Oct 2 2024

Blue bird skies around the Bay Area and Central Coast thanks to
strong high pressure and weak offshore flow. The shallow marine
layer clouds that snuck up the coast yesterday are completely
gone. Some interesting notes this morning: The Oakland sounding
had an 850mb temp of 25.95 C, while not a record for 12Z on Oct 2
it is still higher than the moving max. So what does that mean?
The airmass associated with this high pressure is really warm
around 5,000 feet. This is definitely reflected in the morning
temperatures in the hills. Many locations in the hills had stayed
in the mid 70s to upper 80s. A few stations even had temperatures
in the 90s! at 6-7 AM. Those same areas are running 3-10 degrees
warmer than 24 hours. To put into further perspective about 15-35
degrees above normal for early October.

That being said, given the hot start heat will be a big issue
again. More widespread areas of Extreme HeatRisk today than
yesterday, especially interior/hills regions. Current heat
products remain with a mix of Excessive Heat Warnings and Heat
Advisories. No update needed this morning, but we`ll definitely be
tracking temps through out the day.

Forecast focus with afternoon package will be heat impacts through
much of the upcoming week and when do we actually see relief.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 500 AM PDT Wed Oct 2 2024

Key Points:
* Record breaking heat continues to impact entire forecast area
* A mix of Heat Advisories and Excessive Heat Warnings currently
  in effect
* Limited overnight cooling in the hills - upper 70s to near 90
* Red Flag Warning and Near Critical Fire Weather Conditions (see
  fire weather section below)
* Heat related impacts look to continue into the weekend

Decided to extend the excessive heat warnings and heat advisories
through 11 pm Thursday night.

The daily record high temperatures for October 2nd through October
5th were added at the bottom of the discussion.

An approximately stationary and strong high pressure system with
594 decameter height per Tue afternoon Oakland upper air sounding
was near the early October max moving average. The 850 mb and 925
mb temps slightly exceeded (within a few tenths to approx 1.5 deg
Celsius) the early October warmest on record (period of record since
1948). The 4 am ACV-SFO, WMC-SFO and SAC-SFO pressure gradients are
5.6 mb, 6.8 mb and 0 mb respectively. This pattern will continue
to bring hot and dry weather today. The marine layer is compressed
to near sea level. There may be local influxes of cooler marine
air, but sea-breezes will be limited again today. There`ll be some
radiative cooling tonight in the lower elevations combining with
cooler marine air nearest the coastline. Most inland locations
including at elevation in the hills and mountains tonight will
remain warm to very warm within the strong lower level temperature
inversion.

&&

.LONG TERM...
(Thursday through Tuesday)
Issued at 500 AM PDT Wed Oct 2 2024

Well above normal to near record breaking hot weather continues
into late week possibly including the weekend. The high pressure
system is stuck and lodged in between a strong zonal flow to the
north and otherwise weaker low pressure systems on the periphery.
Long wave ridging is nearly stationary over the western states.
The strong warm core high is also coupled to surface heating,
however eventually the westerlies will break the pattern down.
No appreciable sign of a southerly wind reversal yet. Please stay
tuned to updates.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 510 AM PDT Wed Oct 2 2024

VFR through the TAF period. The marine layer continues to remain
suppressed as high pressure continues to dominate the region. A few
sites this morning are reporting light offshore (E/SE) winds this
morning, though these are expected to turn to become onshore in the
afternoon, generally reaching around 10-12 knots for the majority of
terminals. In the late evening tonight, winds will begin to weaken
to become light, but will maintain a more onshore component.

Vicinity of SFO...VFR through the TAF period. Light NE winds are
present this morning at the terminal. Expect winds to turn to flow
out of the NW this afternoon, with speeds around 10 knots. Winds
ease into the evening to become light.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...Both KMRY and KSNS are reporting light SE
winds this morning. However, KSNS is likely to see SE winds
strengthen to around 10 knots briefly this morning. Towards the late
morning, winds will turn to become more onshore and out of the NW
and breezy. In the early morning of Thursday, winds weaken and turn
to become more SE.

&&

.MARINE...
(Today through Monday)
Issued at 857 AM PDT Wed Oct 2 2024

A fresh to strong NW wind continues, building rough seas in the
northern outer zones. The gradient will relax over the next 24
hours allowing winds to decrease tonight. The sea height will
respond and abate below 10 feet through the day Thursday.
Relatively calm conditions are expected Friday before winds pick
back up to a fresh NNW breeze over the weekend.

&&

.FIRE WEATHER...
Issued at 920 AM PDT Wed Oct 2 2024

Just finished fire weather calls with N and S Ops for California.
The general consensus is that elevated fire weather concerns will
persist through the upcoming weekend. Dry fuels, hot temperatures,
and low humidity will combine to create and mix of NEAR CRITICAL
to CRITICAL fire weather conditions. The one factor that is in our
favor are the winds. Generally speaking the winds are not overly
strong. That being said, there is still periods of offshore flow
forecast for the Central Coast through Thursday evening.
Therefore, while low end conditions still warrant the ongoing Red
Flag Warning for Zone 517,518,516. One potential period of concern
will tonight as a weak ripple rolls through the upper atmosphere.
Winds at 2,500 feet do pick up over the N Bay, E Bay, Santa Cruz
higher terrain Wednesday night into Thursday.

Still valid: Other concerns from a fire weather perspective are
the fuels. Latest observations suggest critically dry fuels.
Current 100 and 1000 hr fuels are near or slightly below avg, but
trending drying Current 10 hr fuels are critically low as well.
Additionally, latest intel with Live Fuel Moisture shows values
trending toward the 60% threshold. Simply put, fuels are receptive
to fire starts.
