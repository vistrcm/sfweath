.UPDATE...
Issued at 848 AM PDT Sat Oct 18 2025

Localized fog and low clouds are visible on satellite within the
East Bay with the Byron Airport and Concord Airport both reporting
5SM visibilities and mist. Any lingering fog and low clouds are
expected to dissipate as we head into the late morning and
temperatures warm up. Interestingly, increased radiational cooling
in the North Bay allowed Santa Rosa to reach an overnight low
temperature of 45 degrees in comparison to the forecasted low
temperature of 50 degrees. Lows generally hovered in the upper 40s
to 50s this morning which is slightly warmer compared to
yesterday`s low temperatures. A few locations in the higher
elevations of the Gabilan Range and Santa Lucia Range in the
Central Coast saw low temperatures drop into the upper 30s.
Otherwise, forecast remains on track with highs in the 70s to mid
80s across the interior today.

.SHORT TERM...
Issued at 106 AM PDT Sat Oct 18 2025
(Today and tonight)

Satellite imagery shows generally clear conditions across the region
with a few patches of stratus. With California under the influence
of a ridge across the western US and a cut off low off the coast of
Baja California, the marine layer remains compressed and light
offshore flow continues in the higher elevations. Thus, minimal
stratus development is expected through the night and skies remain
generally clear through the day with a light onshore breeze in the
afternoon. There is still a slight risk for fog development in the
North Bay, mainly across the Sonoma County valleys, where early
morning commuters are advised to prepare for reduced visibility and
slow down if they encounter patches of fog.

Low temperatures this morning range from the lower to middle 50s
across most of the region, with some of the higher elevations
reaching the upper 50s to the lower 60s while the far interior
Monterey and San Benito County valleys seeing lows dipping into the
middle to upper 40s. Today`s highs range from the upper 70s to the
middle 80s inland, to the middle 70s to lower 80s along the Bays,
the middle 60s to lower 70s along the Pacific coast, and the middle
to upper 60s along the ridgelines.

A Beach Hazards Statement is out through 11 PM tonight due to an
increased risk for sneaker waves and rip currents. Further
information can be found in the Beaches section below.

.LONG TERM...
Issued at 106 AM PDT Sat Oct 18 2025
(Sunday through Friday)

Temperatures remain near or slightly above the seasonal average
through Tuesday with the ridge continuing across the western United
States. A slight cooling trend begins on Wednesday as the cut off
low moves into southern California, with a rebuilding marine layer
being the main impact to sensible weather. Light offshore is
possible in the interior mountains, keeping those areas drier, but
recent rainfall and high fuel moistures will alleviate the fire
weather concerns.

There has been little change in the forecast for the later part of
next week, when a deep trough forms in the Gulf of Alaska and
migrates towards the West Coast. The previous discussion still
applies: Looking farther out, the CPC is continuing to advertise a
potentially significant Atmospheric River impacting the West Coast
10/25-10/27. The major changes since the overnight update was to
expand the high risk of heavy precipitation into the North Bay and a
moderate risk of heavy precipitation into the the rest of the Bay
Area and majority of the Central Coast. The CPC is additionally
highlighting a moderate risk of high winds for the North Bay and a
slight risk of high winds for the rest of the Bay Area and Central
Coast with this system. This system is still over a week out so the
exact system of the track and QPF totals are likely to fluctuate as
we get closer. Residents should stay up to date on the forecast as
this system approaches in order to have the most accurate
information as to what weather to expect.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 441 AM PDT Sat Oct 18 2025

VFR conditions are expected through the TAF cycle with winds
generally remaining around 10kt or less.

Vicinity of SFO...No changes to the forecast as VFR conditions will
prevail over the TAF cycle. Winds will gradually increase today,
with 10kt westerly winds returning mid to late afternoon. Winds
decrease as we head into the evening hours, though they will remain
from the west.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...Quiet weather is expected with VFR
conditions likely prevailing through Friday. Winds should remain
light and around 10kt or less through the period, with winds less
than 5kt during the overnight hours. Some guidance hints at stratus
making a short appearance early Saturday morning. Guidance shows
CIGS around around low end MVFR / high end IFR conditions, but
confidence was too low to do anything other than hint at this
possibility.

.MARINE...
(Today through Thursday)
Issued at 250 AM PDT Sat Oct 18 2025

Fresh to strong northwest gusts will continue for the northern
outer waters into the evening. A longer period northwesterly
swell arrives this weekend 7 to 10 feet at 15 seconds. Northerly
winds should become fresh to strong late Sunday into Monday, with
near gale to gale force gusts expected for the outer waters north
of Point Pinos. Elsewhere during this time, gusts will generally
range from fresh to strong breezes. Near gale force gusts will be
possible near shore north of Point Reyes.

&&

.BEACHES...
Issued at 106 AM PDT Sat Oct 18 2025

A Beach Hazards Statement is in effect through 11 PM tonight as a
long-period swell impacts the Pacific coast. The San Francisco and
Point Arena buoys have begun reporting swell periods of 19 seconds.
The long-period swell increases the risk of sneaker waves and rip
currents across the Pacific coast, potentially catching unaware
swimmers off-guard. Never turn your back to the ocean! Swim near a
lifeguard if possible! If caught in a rip current, swim parallel to
shore until you escape its influence.

Beyond the expiration of the Beach Hazards Statement, another long
period swell arrives in the early part of next week with a Beach
Hazards Statement or a High Surf Advisory possible depending on how
the forecast evolves.

&&

.MTR WATCHES/WARNINGS/ADVISORIES...
CA...Beach Hazards Statement through this evening for CAZ006-505-509-
     529-530.
