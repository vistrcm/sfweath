...New AVIATION...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 315 AM PDT Fri Jul 12 2024

Heat highlights remain in effect through this evening. A nice cool
down this weekend, with near normal temps by early next week.
Otherwise fairly quiet weather through the forecast period.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 315 AM PDT Fri Jul 12 2024

The persistent high pressure responsible for all the recent heat is
currently centered over Utah and will slowly migrate east today and
tomorrow towards the Four Corners region. A weak offshore upper
level low on the eastern periphery of the high, will gradually slide
north over the next couple of days from SoCal to the Central Coast
latitude. Todays highs will continue to be well above normal with
the Excessive Heat Warning and Heat Advisories remaining intact
until 8pm later tonight. Interior temperatures will remain in the
90s to low 100s with some elevated locations approaching 110. A
welcomed cooling trend in temperatures begins on Saturday with many
interior locations seeing a 10 degrees drop in highs from today to
tomorrow afternoon. The offshore upper level low will advect cooler
low level temperatures and moisture as slowly lifts north.

.LONG TERM...
(Saturday through Thursday)
Issued at 315 AM PDT Fri Jul 12 2024

The slow moving upper level low on the western periphery of high
pressure centered over the Four Corners region on Sunday, will
continue to help moderate temperatures in the wake of the recent
heat wave. Mostly zonal flow to our north will begin to buckle and
absorb the upper level low as it moves up the coast of the Pacific
Northwest for the first half of next. Unfortunately, as the upper
low/trough shifts north over water, the persistent area of high
pressure over the desert southwest begins to amplify again across
western CONUS. A warming trend can be seen for the end of next week,
and may be more pronounced than currently progged if the signal for
amplification gets stronger, which allows for the center of the high
to retrograde back to the west closer to central California.
