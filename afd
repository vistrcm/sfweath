.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 455 AM PDT Fri Oct 6 2023

Heat Advisory extended through Saturday for the SF Bay and
Monterey Bay areas. Significant cool down expected by Mon.

&&

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 455 AM PDT Fri Oct 6 2023

Clear skies continue with the Bay Area in the center of the long
wave ridge. Some areas are staying warmer than expected this
morning, mainly due to adiabatic warming from local down slope
flow. For example, Monterey Regional Airport is reporting 71 F at
4:30 AM, actually increasing from 66F around midnight. Meanwhile
the dew point dropped sharply about 10 degrees with ENE winds
brining warm, dry air from the surrounding hills. This trend is
not universal, as the North Bay Valleys have dropped into the
upper 50s this morning.

Temperatures today will be very similar to yesterday and the
forecast remains relatively unchanged. The daily record was broken
at Half Moon Bay Thursday, and there is a chance another record or
two could be challenged today. Specifically 93 at San Rafael
(1976) and 95 at San Jose (1987 and 1930) seem vulnerable.

.LONG TERM...
(Saturday through Thursday)
Issued at 455 AM PDT Fri Oct 6 2023

The Heat Advisory was extended through Saturday.

While the forecast finally stabilized for Friday, significant
upward adjustments were necessary for Saturday`s temperatures.
Based on ensemble and deterministic model consensus, it was clear
that the National Blend was very likely continuing its cold bias
into Saturday. In fact, Saturday may actually be the hottest day of
the week for inland areas of the Diablo Range and into the
Sacramento Valley. Most coastal areas will see a few degrees of
cooling from Thu-Fri, but the cumulative effect of several warm
days in a row will have an impact on vulnerable populations.

There is a growing risk for fire weather concerns Saturday as the
warm dry week has created low humidities and helped dry fuels
across much of the area. The good news is that winds still look
to be light through the driest period.

Sunday will be 5-10 degrees cooler, but remain above average for
this time of year. A significant change is in store Monday as a
cold front ushers in a new air mass. This front will likely bring
some rain to the North Bay and much cooler temperatures to the
entire Bay Area.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 455 AM PDT Fri Oct 6 2023

High pressure will bring VFR conditions and light winds to the
terminals. Breezy onshore flow through the coastal gaps during the
late afternoon and early evening. Light offshore breezes
overnight.

Vicinity of SFO...VFR. Light winds through early afternoon, with
breezy onshore winds into early evening. Light winds return
overnight.

SFO Bridge Approach... Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...VFR. Light offshore/valley drainage
winds this morning. Winds turn light and variable by late morning
with onshore breezes during the early afternoon and evening.

&&

.MARINE...
(Today through Wednesday)
Issued at 455 AM PDT Fri Oct 6 2023

Gentle to moderate breezes will persist into the weekend with
diminishing northwest swell. Increasing winds and waves are
expected by early next week with an arriving northwest swell
train. Cloudier conditions and light rain should affect the
northern waters on Monday into Tuesday.
