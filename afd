...New UPDATE...

.KEY MESSAGES...
Updated at 916 AM PDT Thu Aug 21 2025

 - A Heat Advisory goes into effect at 10 AM for much of the Bay
   Area and Central Coast away from the immediate coastline.

 - Today will be the hottest day for coastal and bayshore areas
   with temperatures in the 70s and 80s respectively.

 - Inland areas will stay hot through Saturday and the heat
   advisory has been extended as a result.

.UPDATE...
Issued at 916 AM PDT Thu Aug 21 2025

The heat advisory has been extended for inland portions of the
East Bay and South Bay, as well as the North Bay interior
mountains, through Saturday. As the previous shift mentioned
below, the ridge actually peaks on Friday or Saturday, so it
makes sense that those days will stay hot inland. For the coast,
it`s a different story. There are some offshore winds at 925 mb
that will push the heat all the way to the beach today. Those
winds will break down late this afternoon, causing the standard
onshore air conditioning to bring some quick relief to the coast
this evening.

.SHORT TERM...
Issued at 215 AM PDT Thu Aug 21 2025
(Today and tonight)

Pretty quiet overnight with mostly clear skies. Satellite imagery
shows less stratus, but still seeing a patch or two near Monterey
Bay and SF Peninsula. Other item of note on the satellite is the
broad area of upper level clouds streaming in from the south.
More on that later.

Temperatures will be the big weather impact over the next 24
hours. Wednesday`s interior warmth was only a preview of what we
can expect the next few days. The 4-corners ridge that scorched
the Desert SW will make its presence known today across a large
portion of the forecast area. If you`re near the coast onshore
flow will keep temperatures in check thanks to some natural AC off
the ocean, but temps will still be above seasonal average. Away
from the coast the well above normal 850mb temps (forecast to be
above 90th percentile) will yield temperatures in the 90s to lower
100s. Could see a few records fall at our climate sites today.
The warmer air aloft has already arrived, as noted by current
temps in the 80s for the hills. A mild start to the day combined
with daytime interior heat HeatRisk values will be in the Moderate
to Major category today. As such, Heat Advisories will go into
effect for interior locations and the SF Bay Shoreline. Tonight
will feature another night with active thermal belts and mild
temps in the hills with little relief.

.LONG TERM...
Issued at 303 AM PDT Thu Aug 21 2025
(Friday through Wednesday)

A slight adjustment has been made for the Friday forecast.
Temperatures near the coast will be within a few degrees of
Thursday`s max temps, but interior locations will warm a few more
degrees as 850mb temperatures make a run at record values.In some
cases, Friday will actually be the hottest day of this round of
heat. Saturday will be a transition day as the ridge begins to
ease its grip. While temps begin to cool on Saturday far interior
locations are still in the triple digits, especially interior
Central Coast. Therefore, extended the Heat Advisory for interior
Monterey/San Benito counties with HeatRisk staying in the
Moderate to Major with a few pockets of Extreme. This blends well
with our neighboring counties. Temperatures will remain above
seasonal average into next week, but do expect a gradual cooldown
Sunday through Wednesday. Temperatures will drop 3 to 5 degrees
each day, which will lower HeatRisk concerns each day too.

Now for the wrinkle and wildcard in the forecast. The high clouds
currently streaming in from the south is upper level monsoonal
moisture wrapping around the ridge of high pressure. Models
continue to vary on details with the monsoonal moisture and its
impacts. However, most show solid upper level moisture, decent
lapse rates from 700-500mb, MUCAPE (some CAMS are very high),
critical modified Total-totals, and classic inverted V point
soundings. One piece of the puzzle is a more pronounced lifting
mechanism or trigger. After coordinating with neighboring offices
will continue to advertise this as a non-zero chance for
thunderstorms. Given the profile developed storms would have a
higher chance to be dry. The threat for convection still remains
focused on Friday and Saturday over the Central Coast.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 441 AM PDT Thu Aug 21 2025

Patchy coastal stratus and fog /IFR-LIFR/ continues this morning
and redevelops tonight and Friday morning otherwise it`s VFR.

Vicinity of SFO...VFR. Northwest to west wind 5 knots increasing
to 16 to 22 knots this afternoon to mid evening, then west wind 10
knots shifting to light northeast Friday morning.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...Patchy coastal stratus and fog /IFR-LIFR/
this morning and tonight to Friday morning otherwise VFR. Mainly
onshore winds 5 to 15 knots.

.MARINE...
(Today through Tuesday)
Issued at 215 AM PDT Thu Aug 21 2025

Breezy to gusty northwest winds will prevail through Friday
morning, especially across the outer waters and coastal jet
regions near  Point Sur and Point Reyes. This will result in
widespread hazardous conditions for small craft. Wind and seas
will gradually ease Friday  afternoon and evening, leading to
calmer conditions over the weekend and well into the next work
week.

&&

.FIRE WEATHER...
Issued at 305 AM PDT Thu Aug 21 2025

Will continue to carry a headline in the forecast through the
weekend for elevated fire weather concerns due to hot/dry
conditions day/night with daily sea breeze winds. Critical
humidity values will be reached afternoon with little to no
relief at night. Winds don`t appear to be strong enough for an
extended period of time to warrant a Red Flag. ERC charts will be
responding to the warm up. In addition, we are monitoring a surge
of monsoonal moisture set to arrive on Friday through the weekend,
which will bring a very low, but non-zero, chance for elevated
convection across the Central Coast. Greatest concern for any
developed storm would be dry lightning.
