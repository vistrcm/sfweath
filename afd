.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 422 AM PST Thu Nov 16 2023

Showers with isolated storms will be possible through much of the
day. Moderate rains and a more defined rain band moves through
Friday afternoon and into the night. Additional showers and storm
chances are expected after the main rain band exits. The forecast
dries and begins to warm Sunday.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 422 AM PST Thu Nov 16 2023

It has been a fairly calm night in between the rain makers, with mid
to high clouds continuing to build into the area. The low pressure
that has been the main focus of the forecast for the last week
continues to churn to the west. The system has been producing storm
cells and fairly frequent lightning roughly 300 miles to the
southwest, but these cells look to remain at sea.

Some of the potential for convection begins to move east in the
early morning, turning focus on storm development in the marine
zones. Convection potential increases into the afternoon and begins
to spread overland along with some scattered showers. Chances for
isolated storms last through the afternoon and linger into the
evening. Luckily these storms do not look to be widespread, but
locally heavy rain, strong winds, and lightning will be possible.
Shower and storm chances reduce into the night.

.LONG TERM...
(Friday through Wednesday)
Issued at 422 AM PST Thu Nov 16 2023

The overnight forecast updates continue to show a slowing of the low
pressure`s movement, resulting in a delay in the next rain band and
widespread rainfall. The current forecast calls showery and drizzly
conditions Friday morning with increasing southerly winds. Peak
winds and gusts are expected ahead of the arrival of the rain band
and it`s low pressure center, both moving inland in the late
afternoon and becoming spreading over the CWA into the night. The
low will collect additional moisture from the south and push it into
the Central Coast, resulting in the strongest rain chances and
increased rainfall along the Big Sur Coast. Behind the main rain
band, showery conditions will linger with chances for isolated
storms spreading inland once again. Convection potential decreases
Saturday night but scattered showers will persist. Showers weaken
through Saturday, but linger until early Sunday morning.



The overnight forecast package calls for the following rainfall
amounts between now and through Sunday morning:


0.30" to 0.60": Santa Clara Valley, Interior East Bay, Northern
Salinas Valley

0.61" to 1.00": San Francisco, San Mateo Coast, Oakland, East Bay
Hills, Interior North Bay, San Mateo Co, lower elevations of Santa
Cruz Co, San Benito Co, Southern Salinas Valley,

1.01 to 1.50": Santa Cruz Mtns, Coastal North Bay

1.51" to 2.50": Big Sur Coast

Higher elevations along the Big Sur Coast look to pass the inch mark
as will as the highest peaks in the Santa Cruz Mtns and Mt Tamalpais
in the North Bay.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 422 AM PST Thu Nov 16 2023

At this time, conditions are VFR across the region with the
exception of KSTS and KSFO where ceilings are just barely MVFR, but
expected to lift to become VFR into the mid morning. Otherwise, VFR
conditions are expected through the TAF period, with mid to high
clouds continuing to be present. Winds today generally out of the
S/SE strengthen into the afternoon to become breezy, then easing
into the evening to become light as the next chances of rain begin.
Highest confidence is in rain beginning to impact terminals into the
evening hours tonight, near 01-03Z.


Vicinity of SFO...Low clouds are expected to lift to bring VFR
conditions towards the mid morning hours. Current MVFR conditions
are expected to be brief. Beyond the mid morning, VFR persists
through the TAF period though mid to high level clouds remain. Winds
generally light out of the SE, but become variable into the
afternoon and evening. Rain chances begin towards 01Z.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...VFR through the TAF period, with mid to
high level clouds present. Winds out of the SE strengthen into the
afternoon today to become moderate to gusty specifically for KSNS
with sustained speeds up to 20 knots, and gusts of 25 knots. Towards
nightfall, winds begin to weaken for all terminals becoming light.
Rain approaches the region into the evening.

.MARINE...
(Today through Tuesday)
Issued at 422 AM PST Thu Nov 16 2023

Rain chances continue across the waters as a low pressure system
impacts the region, with isolated thunderstorm chances continuing
predominantly over the southern and outer waters through at least
early Saturday. Into the night of Saturday, rain chances look to
decrease. Fresh to strong southerly breezes are expected through
at least the first part of the weekend, with gales developing
Friday morning. Gales reduce to become fresh to strong breezes
into the evening of Friday. Quieter and dry weather returns for
early next week.
