of marine stratus and cooler temperatures. Cool temperatures
persist into next week with troughing along the West Coast.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 310 AM PDT Sun Jun 18 2023

Latest surface analysis reveals a dry cold front knocking on the
Bay Area`s doorstep overnight. The dry cold front is forecast to
move through the Bay Area and CEntral Coast this morning into
early this afternoon. The fropa is in response to an upper low
dropping southward from BC to the PacNW. So what does this mean
for our local weather? Ahead of the front some morning stratus is
possible with patchy drizzle, mainly San Francisco Peninsula coast
southward. Similar to the last few mornings a hundredth or two of
precip is possible with the drizzle, especially in terrain
favored locations like the Santa Cruz mountains. The fropa itself
will be dry, but the more notable change will be the increase in
winds, drop in temperatures, and mixing of the stratus deck.
Winds:
behind the front cold advection combined with increased onshore
flow will lead to stronger winds. Still just under Wind Advisory
criteria, but gusts in the 30-40 mph range seem plausible. Winds
will be strongest over the coastal waters, coastline, coastal
gaps, and inland passes. Of note, hi-res models continue to
highlight the East Bay passes with some rather strong winds today.
Ensembles give a 30-40% chance of exceeding 45 mph for a brief
window this afternoon. Winds will remain ease a little this
evening, but remain breezy tonight into Monday. Temperatures:
While Saturday featured milder temperatures today will be much
cool and given the wind it will feel cooler too. Highs today will
be in the 60s to lower 70s coast/bays and 70s to lower 80s inland.
Still several degrees below seasonal averages. Stratus deck:
better mixing and cooler air aloft will help to make the stratus
deck more diffuse and mix it out. Expect more sunshine this
afternoon with less clouds tonight overall. However, San Mateo
coast and Monterey Peninsula still have a 60-70% chance of see
some patchy stratus develop late tonight/early Monday.

.LONG TERM...
(Monday through Saturday)
Issued at 327 AM PDT Sun Jun 18 2023

Cool and breezy to start off the week behind the departing weekend
cold front. The longwave pattern through mid week doesn`t change
very much. Broad upper level troughing with breezy onshore flow
with cool temperatures. Second half of the upcoming weekend
continues to show a slight change in the longwave pattern aloft.
The broad upper trough deepens into an cut-off upper low over
Central CA Thursday/Friday. The upper low will help to
reform/deepen the marine layer. Additionally, drizzle-fest will
likely return too. More coarse resolution medium range model
guidance is showing QPF Thursday/Friday, which is usually a good
sign for drizzle. Temperatures will remain on the cool-side for
both daytime highs and overnight lows through the week. In fact,
both 6-10 and 8-14 day outlooks from CPC show below normal
temperates for the Bay Area and Central Coast. At this rate, June
Gloom will quickly turn into No Sky July.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 423 AM PDT Sun Jun 18 2023

High clouds clearing off to the south reveal a layer of stratus
hugging the coast of the San Mateo Peninsula and across the Monterey
Bay region, extending inland into Gilroy and Hollister and down the
Salinas Valley. In addition, a patch of stratus is set up on the
Berkeley Hills near OAK. Minimal stratus expansion expected for the
rest of the night, while an approaching dry cold front brings gusty
winds throughout the day. Northwesterly flow will persist across the
region, with winds gusting to 20-30 knots at the terminals.
Sustained surface winds will diminish somewhat overnight, before
becoming gusty again during the day on Monday, beyond the end of the
TAF period. Low to moderate confidence in developing MVFR stratus
this evening with the best chances around the Monterey Bay region
and lower confidence across the East Bay Hills into the eastern
Santa Clara mountains.

Vicinity of SFO...VFR today and high confidence (80-90% probability)
that it lasts through the TAF period. Very strong west-northwest
winds gusting to 30-35 knots starting this afternoon, continuing
through the night and into Monday. A low to moderate confidence (30-
50% probability) of wind gusts at or above 35 knots.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...MVFR-IFR stratus through around 15-17Z.
Moderate to high confidence (60-70% probability) that MRY clears out
by around 17Z, with NBM output still suggesting a later clearing
around 19Z. West-northwest winds gusting up to 15-20 knots this
afternoon. Moderate to high (60-70% probability) of MVFR stratus
returning to MRY after midnight, with lower confidence (30-40%
probability) at SNS.

.MARINE...
(Today through Friday)
Issued at 248 AM PDT Sun Jun 18 2023

Strong gusty northwest winds continue through Thursday, creating
steep and hazardous wind waves across the waters. Gale force gusts
expected today and Monday along the immediate coast between Point
Arena and the Golden Gate, and south of Point Sur. Occasional
gale force gusts are also possible on Monday between Davenport and
Monterey, including into Monterey Bay. Gusty winds will also
impact the San Francisco bay and flow into the Delta, especially
in the afternoon and evening hours. Longer period southerly swell
continues alongside shorter period and light northerly swell.
