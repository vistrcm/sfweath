...New UPDATE, MARINE...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 1237 AM PDT Sun May 26 2024

Warmer today as a warming trend kicks off through the week.
Afternoon highs slightly above normal on tap for next weekend.

&&

.UPDATE...
Issued at 854 AM PDT Sun May 26 2024

Much less marine layer influence to start the day. Visible
satellite imagery still shows some coastal stratus nudging its
way locally inland, but coverage is much less than 24 hours ago.
It goes with out saying, much less in the way of drizzle this
morning too. Only one or two reports of drizzle.

Morning clouds are expected to clear back to the coast with some
patchy stratus hugging the coast through the afternoon. All in
all, a pleasant Sunday with warmer temperatures than Saturday.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 1237 AM PDT Sun May 26 2024

Continued quiet weather to round out the weekend. Warmer today
compared to yesterday as the upper low responsible for the drizzle
the last couple of days finally moves out and a broad ridge builds
in its wake. Temperatures warm to around seasonal normals with
highs inland in the mid-to-upper 70s and lower 60s closer to the
coast. Though dry weather persists, as does onshore flow,
providing decent moisture return through the week.

&&

.LONG TERM...
(Monday through Saturday)
Issued at 1237 AM PDT Sun May 26 2024

Seasonal temps last through the week with no real large-scale
change in the pattern. A progressive, deep upper low traverses
through the Pacific NW midweek to flatten the ridge a bit. This
will keep any further warming at bay through the middle of the
week, but isn`t expected to bring any other notable change to the
sensible weather. As this feature departs, the ridge builds back
and a secondary warming trend continues into the weekend. Not
staring down any major heat wave by any means, but there`s a good
chance our afternoon highs are slightly above normal by next
weekend.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 400 AM PDT Sun May 26 2024

MVFR low clouds are affecting most of the coastal terminals early
this morning and will persist through the late morning to early
afternoon hours before clearing back towards the coast. Thereafter
look for breezy onshore winds, although not as strong overall
compared to the past few days. Low clouds return early this
evening for the Monterey Bay terminals and later tonight around
the Bay Area.

Vicinity of SFO...MVFR low clouds persisting until around 21Z
today before scattering out. Breezy onshore winds this afternoon
with gusts to around 25kt. MVFR clouds return tonight around/after
08Z with winds easing to around 10 kt.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...MVFR low clouds persisting until around
20Z before scattering out. Clouds may linger a bit longer in the
vicinity of KMRY. Expect onshore breezes generally around 10 kt or
less this afternoon, except 15-20 kt gusts through the Salinas
Valley after 20Z. Winds easing early this evening with MVFR to
high end IFR stratus returning around/after 03Z.

.MARINE...
(Today through Friday)
Issued at 854 AM PDT Sun May 26 2024

Northwest breeze over the outer waters persists through Memorial
Day weekend creating hazardous conditions for small crafts. Fresh
to strong northwest and onshore winds across the coastal waters
and bays during the afternoons mid next week. Wave heights
beginning to increase by the middle of the work week up to 11 to
13 feet. Otherwise mostly quiet marine conditions through the
forecast period.
