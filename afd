...New SYNOPSIS, UPDATE...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 805 AM PDT Sun Sep 1 2024

A weak upper level system will continue to dominate our weather
through Labor Day, with dry and cooler conditions along with gusty
onshore winds prevailing. High pressure will then rebuild across
the region for Tuesday through Thursday, with a warming trend
will develop for the majority of the work week.

&&

.UPDATE...
Issued at 805 AM PDT Sun Sep 1 2024

Water vapor imagery shows a weak upper level system, centered
near 39.3 North and -129 West, digging off the Northern
California Coast this morning. This system will continue to be the
primary weather influencer over the next 36 hours, keeping
temperatures near to below normal across the region and gusty
onshore flow prevailing. With that said, the marine layer is being
a bit fickle, despite the approaching trough and deepening to
between 1600 feet and 2000 feet, according to the 12z KOAK
sounding and Fort Ord profiler. Visible imagery shows this, as it
is significantly more patchy in nature this morning. Despite less
cloud cover across the San Francisco and Monterey Bays,
temperatures are still running within 2 degrees of this time
yesterday morning. Expect temperatures to remain 5 to 10 degrees
below normal today for most areas. The southern San Benito and
Monterey Counties may be the one exception though, as temperatures
will once again likely top out around 100 degrees. Did a quick
update this morning to back off of the cloud cover for this
morning and to remove any mention of drizzle. Palmer

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 156 AM PDT Sun Sep 1 2024

An upper-level trough 400 miles off the coast of the
California/Oregon border will dominate weather in the region through
Monday. Temperatures will be near normal to slightly below normal
with the exception of higher elevations and winds will remain
onshore with gusty conditions expected through gaps and passes. The
marine layer is currently being observed at 1,200 feet and is
expected to deepen to 2,000 feet as the upper-level trough
progresses east. This somewhat deep marine layer in addition to the
lifting mechanisms of the upper-level trough and the terrain will
allow for coastal drizzle. Low clouds will wander into coastal and
valley locations this morning before giving way to abundant sunshine
this afternoon.

Let`s talk holiday weekend safety. While the weather is relatively
quiet, it does not mean that there are not other hazards out there.

Water safety:

-Whenever possible, swim at beaches with lifeguards. The chances of
drowning at a beach with lifeguards are 1 in 18 million.

-Do what experienced surfers and lifeguards do: watch the ocean for
at least 20 minutes. Study its wave patterns. Get a feel for the
pattern of the waves before relaxing on the beach or engaging in
recreational activities.

-Cold water shock can be just as severe and dangerous from water
temperatures of 50-60F as it is from water at 35F. Wearing a
life jacket significantly increases chances of survival.

-Never turn your back on the ocean.

Fire safety:

-Use grills/smokers on gravel or paved surfaces.

-Keep water stored near campfires, fire pits, grills, smokers,
burning brush, etc.

-Maintain vehicle brakes and tires, and secure tow chains to avoid
dragging. Don`t drive on dry grass or brush.

.LONG TERM...
(Monday through Saturday)
Issued at 156 AM PDT Sun Sep 1 2024

Tomorrow will be very similar to today with the exception of the
marine layer. The marine layer will further deepen to 2,500 feet
tomorrow morning as the upper-level low traverses inland, but high
pressure and accompanying subsidence will quickly build into the
region tomorrow night compressing the marine layer to 500 feet.

The aforementioned high pressure will yield widespread moderate
HeatRisk with Wednesday forecast to have the greatest impact. Fire
weather concerns will increase Tuesday-Thursday in the higher
elevations due to poor relative humidity recoveries and
northerly/offshore winds during the overnight and morning hours,
albeit weak. A minor cooling trend and the return of onshore flow
will begin Friday.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 358 AM PDT Sun Sep 1 2024

MVFR and IFR CIGS are forming across the region will become
widespread in the mid morning. Expect mostly light winds through
much of the morning. Moderate to breezy winds build into the
afternoon after CIGS erode with some breezier winds along the
coast. These winds look to reduce become lighter into the evening.
Cloud cover looks to have difficulty returning until early
Monday.

Vicinity of SFO...MVFR CIGS are building and look to last through
the late morning. CIGS erode in the late morning with breezy
winds returning in the mid-afternoon and last into the early
night. Winds stay moderate for overnight with MVFR CIGs returning
Monday morning.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO

Monterey Bay Terminals...IFR/MVFR CIGs and lighter winds last
into the late morning. Expect moderate winds and VFR into the
afternoon and through the evening before lighter winds return.
CIGs build in early Monday.

.MARINE...
(Today through Friday)
Issued at 358 AM PDT Sun Sep 1 2024

Gusty, westerly winds build through the Golden Gate and into the
northern San Francisco Bay this afternoon. Northwesterly winds
will strengthen over the southern coastal zones, specifically near
Point Sur, this weekend and into early next week resulting in
building moderate seas. By early next week, northwest winds are
expected to strengthen over the outer waters with seas over the
northern waters in particular becoming rough.
