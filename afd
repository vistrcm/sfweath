.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 224 AM PDT Wed Sep 13 2023

High temperatures around the seasonal average today with breezy
winds. A slight cooling trend begins Friday and persists into the
early part of next week.

&&

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 224 AM PDT Wed Sep 13 2023

A band of stratus has developed along the coast south of the Golden
Gate, with extensive inland development around Monterey Bay, into
the Morgan Hill-Gilroy area and down the Salinas Valley.
Expecting further stratus development inland for the rest of the
night, with most areas clearing out in the morning. Areas at the
immediate coast of the San Mateo Peninsula and southern Monterey
Bay will scatter out for a couple of hours in the afternoon before
stratus returns pretty early in the evening. With a deep marine
layer of around 1500-2000 feet, drizzle is possible through the
night and into the morning, primarily along the coast south of the
Golden Gate.

High temperatures today will generally be around the seasonal
average, generally into the mid to upper 60s along the Pacific
coast, the mid 70s to lower 80s at the Bayshore, and the upper 80s
to lower 90s in the inland valleys. Breezy onshore flow will develop
in the afternoon with wind speeds generally up to 10 to 15 miles per
hour, with winds up to 20 miles per hour possible near Soledad and
Greenfield, and later this evening, through the Altamont Pass.

.LONG TERM...
(Thursday through Tuesday)
Issued at 1235 AM PDT Wed Sep 13 2023

An upper trough will progress from the central Great Basin into the
Four Corners region on Thursday, with high pressure building in
its wake. Light offshore winds and high-elevation drying is
possible initially over the North Bay hills, but impacts to fire
weather appear minimal. Look for slight warming and a marine layer
compression on Friday with high pressure around the area. An
upper low develops along the CA coast this weekend and persists
into early next week. This will bring stronger onshore winds,
cooler temperatures, and a deepening marine layer. The most likely
forecast outcome keeps meaningful precipitation north of our area
but can`t rule out some light accumulations in drizzle along the
coast given the favorable pattern.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 417 AM PDT Wed Sep 13 2023

Generally IFR stratus along the coast from Point Reyes southward,
with significant inland coverage around the city of San Francisco,
Monterey Bay, the Morgan Hill-Gilroy area, and down the Salinas
Valley. Expecting expanded coverage of stratus across the SF Bay and
the North Bay valleys until sunrise. A moderate to high confidence
(60-80% probability) that SJC remains VFR through the night.
Considered adding a TEMPO for BKN IFR ceilings, but opted against
it for now. Meanwhile at STS, confidence in stratus coverage has
decreased as model guidance has backed off on coverage in the
area. Have retained a TEMPO group around the time of the greatest
potential for ceilings.

Stratus will generally mix out through the morning, with the coastal
areas south of the Golden Gate potentially staying clouded through
the day. Breezy onshore winds develop in the afternoon, diminishing
in the evening. Stratus will start to expand inland early in the
evening near Monterey Bay, with further development across the
inland regions through the night.

Vicinity of SFO... SFO and OAK have remarkably remained clear
through the night so far, as the stratus slowly makes its way across
the city of San Francisco. Expecting at least a temporary ceiling
across the northern SF Bay before sunrise, with clearing throughout
the morning. West-northwesterly flow develops in the afternoon with
gusts up to 15-20 knots. Stratus will develop after midnight into
Thursday, clearing again in the morning.

SFO Bridge Approach... Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals... IFR-LIFR through the night. SNS clears in
the morning, with moderate to high confidence (60-70% probability)
that MRY scatters out for a brief period in the afternoon. Breezy
onshore winds up to 10 knots develop in the afternoon, followed by
stratus redeveloping early in the evening or perhaps late afternoon,
through the end of the TAF period.

&&

.MARINE...
(Today through Monday)
Issued at 224 AM PDT Wed Sep 13 2023

Gusty northwest winds across the outer waters and the coastal jets
will start to diminish later this morning, becoming gentle to
moderate by Thursday and remaining so through the weekend.
Meanwhile, light southerly swell continues to traverse the region,
in  addition to light northerly swell with a moderate period
around 11 seconds. A new lighter, long period southerly swell
train arrives midweek.
