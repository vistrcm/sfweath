...New UPDATE, MARINE...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 221 AM PDT Mon Aug 5 2024

Warm temps continue early this week. Hot Tuesday where a Heat
Advisory has been issued. Cooling trend kicks off Wednesday with
normal temperatures expected by the end of the week.

&&

.UPDATE...
Issued at 900 AM PDT Mon Aug 5 2024

Widespread stratus is beginning to lift and recede back towards
the coast this morning. The forecast remains on track with a Heat
Advisory in effect from 10 AM to 10 PM tomorrow for the Santa
Clara Valley, Eastern Santa Clara Hills, Southern Salinas Valley,
and interior portions of Monterey and San Benito Counties. No
anticipated changes to the forecast at this time.

&&

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 221 AM PDT Mon Aug 5 2024

High temps today very similar to yesterday, as is the marine layer
depth due to not much significant strengthening of the ridge
aloft. A quick check of temperature trends early this morning
elucidates this with temps running about the same to 1-2 degrees
cooler than 24 hours ago. Marine layer compression will begin to
take place tonight as we finally start to see the 500 mb heights
rise.

&&

.LONG TERM...
(Tuesday through Sunday)
Issued at 221 AM PDT Mon Aug 5 2024

Tuesday looks to be the warmest day of the week when 500 mb
heights reach their peak. Compared to the previous forecast,
temperatures have increased by a few degrees, ultimately leading
to widespread moderate HeatRisk across the interior Central Coast
and the Santa Clara Valley with isolated pockets of major
HeatRisk. These areas were teetering on the edge of an advisory in
previous forecasts. Given the increase in risk, a Heat Advisory
has been issued for these areas in effect from 10 AM to 10 PM
Tuesday. Elsewhere outside of the advisory area will still be
plenty warm, but will see better overnight relief and overall less
risk due to the temps not being as far above normal as the
those in the advisory area. A cooling trend kicks off Wednesday
lasting into the weekend. By Thursday onward, most areas are
likely to see near normal temperatures. For the latter half of the
week, there is a chance of seeing some moisture brought forth by
the plethora of tropical systems in the EPac west of Mexico. As of
now it just looks like some mid-to-high clouds and no other major
impacts. Just something to note.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 436 AM PDT Mon Aug 5 2024

Widespread IFR-LIFR stratus across the valleys is expected to
persist through the late morning, with patchy fog possible in the
North Bay valleys and Monterey Bay region. Breezy onshore flow
developing in the afternoon as inland stratus mixes out. Stratus
builds back inland during the evening and overnight hours.

Vicinity of SFO... IFR-LIFR stratus continues through the late
morning. Breezy west-northwest winds with gusts up to 25 knots
expected to develop this afternoon. Moderate confidence that stratus
returns to the terminal late this evening, but some guidance has the
terminal on the edge of stratus flowing in through the Golden Gate.

SFO Bridge Approach... Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals... LIFR stratus present across the region
through the morning, with patchy fog possible especially at the
immediate coast. Breezy onshore flow develops this afternoon before
stratus returns to the area in the early evening hours.

&&

.MARINE...
(Today through Saturday)
Issued at 900 AM PDT Mon Aug 5 2024

Expect breezy northwesterly winds gusty conditions for the outer
waters, with light northwesterly winds continuing across the inner
coastal waters. Across the northern outer waters, seas will become
rough and wave heights will build to 8 to 10 feet by Tuesday.
Seas will and wave heights will ease by late week before starting
to build again over the weekend.
