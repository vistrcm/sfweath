Chilly overnight temperatures continue with a Frost Advisory
currently in effect in the southern Salinas Valley until 9 AM and a
new Frost Advisory for the inland Bay Area and Central Coast on
Tuesday morning. Gusty offshore winds continue today through early
Tuesday morning across the higher elevations of the Bay Area. Slight
chance for rain midweek with better rain chances Friday into the
early part of next week.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 117 AM PST Mon Dec 9 2024

The forecast for cold temperatures is on track tonight, as clear
skies promote radiational cooling throughout the region. As of
midnight most of the region is reporting temperatures in the 40s,
with the coastal and higher elevation regions seeing temperatures
into the low to mid 50s. Across southern Monterey County,
temperatures at midnight were 33 at the Bradley RAWS, 35 at the
Parkfield RAWS, and 38 at the Fort Hunter Liggett RAWS. A Frost
Advisory is now in effect for the southern Salinas Valley (beginning
halfway between Soledad and Greenfield, extending to the south) and
the area around San Antonio Lake, as low temperatures reach the low
to mid 30s across the region. Elsewhere, the inland valleys see lows
in the upper 30s to lower 40s while lows in the mid to upper 40s are
expected along the coast and Bayshore.

Gusty offshore winds are also developing across the higher
elevations of the Bay Area and Santa Cruz Mountains, as an "inside
slider" descends through the Great Basin. The highest gusts recorded
so far are a pair of 40 mph gusts at Mount Saint Helena and the
Santa Fe Geothermal PG&E station. Winds will continue building
through the night, with gusts topping out around 35-45 mph across
eastern Napa County and 25-35 mph across higher elevations elsewhere
in the Bay Area. Significantly lower gusts are expected in the
valleys, and across the Central Coast. Winds will start to diminish
through the day Monday but will remain gusty into the early hours of
Tuesday morning.

High temperatures today range from the middle to upper 60s in the
inland valleys, into the upper 50s to lower 60s along the coast, and
down into the lower to middle 50s in the higher elevations.

.LONG TERM...
(Tuesday through Sunday)
Issued at 117 AM PST Mon Dec 9 2024

Upper level ridging will continue to promote clear skies through the
next couple of days as high temperatures remain relatively similar
through the midweek, with a slight cooling across the North Bay into
the northern San Francisco Bay Area on Tuesday. The clear skies will
help cooler temperatures take hold on Tuesday morning. A Frost
ADvisory has now been issued from midnight through 9 AM on Tuesday,
due to low temperatures in the low to mid 30s in the North Bay
valleys, the interior East Bay, the Santa Clara Valley and east
Santa Clara hills, the southern Salinas Valley, and the interior
mountains of Monterey and San Benito counties. Elsewhere, low
temperatures in the low to mid 40s are expected along the coastal
and Bayshore regions. Wednesday sees the return of high clouds
across the region with an advancing front, slightly cooling the
daytime temperatures but helping warm the nights by inhibiting
radiation of heat into space.

To prepare for these cold temperatures, remember the Four P`s of
Winter Weather:

People: Dress in layers and wear a hat that covers the ears. Pay
special attention to children and the elderly, who are more
vulnerable to the cold.
Plants: Bring potted plants indoors and keep outdoor plants and
trees protected.
Pets: Bring all pets indoors. Pets and other animals that have to be
kept outdoors should have an enclosed shelter.
Pipes: Make sure all external water pipes are insulated. Keep an
interior faucet running at a drip to prevent ice buildup.

Model guidance continues to indicate that the pattern will become
more active towards the middle and late part of the week. Some
scattered rain chances arrive later Wednesday into Thursday, with
the possible arrival of a shortwave trough. The ensemble models are
beginning to converge onto the shortwave trough coming into the
western US, but chances for coastal drizzle remain quite low (up to
10-30% through Wednesday and Thursday) with accumulating
precipitation not expected. A stronger low pressure system arrives
on Friday, bringing more impressive rain potential but with
continuing uncertainty and fluctuation over the rain totals. The
overall trends are still the same: greatest totals in the North Bay,
with half an inch to an inch of rain in the valleys, potentially up
to 2 inches in the higher elevations, with generally less than half
of an inch across the rest of the Bay Area and Central Coast.
Throughout all of this, there is still room for fluctuation in the
rainfall totals through Friday. Ensemble cluster analysis reveals a
group of around 30-40% of the ensemble members that continue to
advertise a potential for rainfall totals higher than the current
forecast. Thus, continued attention to forecast updates is strongly
advised.

Peeking into the early part of next week, ensemble model runs show
the potential for a brief lull in the rain towards the end of the
upcoming weekend, with another system possible for the early part of
the week. CPC outlooks suggest that temperatures lean above seasonal
averages into the third week of December, with precipitation total
outlook just leaning above seasonal averages across the North Bay,
and just leaning below seasonal averages in the Central Coast.&&

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 349 AM PST Mon Dec 9 2024

As high pressure builds over a dry airmass, there is high
confidence in VFR conditions through the TAF period. Winds will be
mostly gentle, but with an offshore gradient developing, the
direction may shift through the day.

Vicinity of SFO...High confidence VFR through the TAF period. Some
high clouds this morning will clear by the afternoon. There will
be a bit of a battle between synoptically forced offshore winds
and diurnally driven onshore winds. Despite the direction
uncertainty, the wind speed will stay gentle through the TAF
period.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...High confidence VFR through the TAF
period with a gentle offshore breeze.

&&

.MARINE...
(Today through Saturday)
Issued at 904 AM PST Mon Dec 9 2024

Rough seas will abate through the day as favorable conditions
return. Shifting light to moderate wind and moderate seas will
prevail through mid week. Guidance continues to show the
potential for a strong offshore storm that could bring very rough
seas to the coastal waters this weekend.
