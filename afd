.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 1249 AM PST Sun Nov 12 2023

Pleasant weather continues Sunday before a pattern change brings
widespread rainfall later this week.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 1241 AM PST Sun Nov 12 2023

High pressure aloft will be the primary influence on our weather
today as the storm track remains to our north. A few high clouds
will appear from time to time across the Bay Area along the
periphery of an upper level jet but otherwise sunny conditions will
prevail. Light offshore winds will persist through midday given a
modest SFO-WMC offshore pressure gradient with a transition to
onshore winds by late afternoon. This will occur as high pressure
gradually loses influence by tonight in response to digging
troughing over the eastern Pacific. As better onshore flow commences
look for a bit more low stratus development tonight over the waters
and along portions of the coast. Better odds for some fog
development over portions of the North Bay valleys as well tonight
based on a consensus of high resolution model guidance. Mild
temperatures will prevail today with highs in the 70s to near 80
away from the coast. Lows tonight will dip into the 40s except near
50 along the coast and bays.

.LONG TERM...
(Monday through Saturday)
Issued at 1249 AM PST Sun Nov 12 2023

A gale force low pressure system in the Gulf of Alaska will dive
southeast over the next 36 to 48 hours, eventually stalling about
500 miles west of the Bay Area. This set up will bring moist
southerly flow to the region through the week. After several days
meandering in the eastern Pacific, the system will eventually
weaken and move onshore somewhere along the California coast by
late week. The biggest impact from this system will be periods of
moderate rainfall across the Bay Area and rough conditions in the
coastal waters.

Significant uncertainty remains in the exact rainfall totals
through the week. The current forecast calls for rain to begin
late Monday and continue through Friday, with roughly 2-3 inches
for most areas. More rain is expected in the coastal mountains
with less in any valleys with terrain shelter to the south.
While the forecast hasn`t changed significantly, the ensemble
guidance continues to indicate a wide range of possible outcomes.
In fact, the NBM 90th and 10th percentiles were almost outrageous,
with over 10 inches on the high end and only a trace on the low
end. While that`s a safe range, it`s not very useful. The GEFS
and ECMWF EPS are more reasonable, but still show an equal
potential for 1/2" or 4". Normally this spread would be tighter by
now, but the fact that the main driver is a quasi-stationary low
makes the forecast more uncertain that a typical fast moving cold
front, for example. One look at the deterministic GFS vs ECMWF
show that by Friday the low could still be spinning in the waters
off the Bay Area, or making landfall as an open trough in Southern
California. Without much steering flow, it`s difficult to pin
down the details and the uncertainty will likely remain high even
as the event begins.

With persistent southerly flow increasing the humidity, there is
a hint of instability developing during this event. As such, a few
thunderstorms are possible Wednesday or Thursday. Otherwise,
mostly cloudy skies will keep the afternoons cool and the
mornings mild. Expect temperatures to range from the high 40s/low
50s in the mornings to mid/upper 60s in the afternoons.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 308 AM PST Sun Nov 12 2023

VFR through today outside of the small potential (10-15%) for
sub-VFR visibility at KSTS this morning. Look for increasing high
level clouds into tonight with low stratus developing along
coastal areas. Better potential tomorrow night for
ceiling/visibility restrictions at KSTS, with moderate confidence
(40-50%) in IFR ceilings developing at the Monterey Bay terminals.
Light drainage winds this morning will become onshore this
afternoon and evening.

Vicinity of SFO...VFR with some high clouds today. Low stratus may
approach the terminal by this evening but low confidence in
ceiling development. Trends will be monitored with future TAF
issuances. Light winds this morning becoming onshore by late this
afternoon.

SFO Bridge Approach... Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...VFR into early this evening. Moderate
confidence (40-50%) in IFR ceilings developing this evening but
low confidence in exact timing. Watch for updates. Light drainage
winds this morning become onshore around 10 kt this afternoon.

.MARINE...
(Today through Friday)
Issued at 1241 AM PST Sun Nov 12 2023

Gentle to moderate northerly breezes are expected across the local
waters into tonight. A northwest swell around 12-16 seconds will
produce elevated seas through this evening resulting in hazardous
conditions for small craft operators. Winds turn southerly by
Monday as a strong low pressure system brings rain, hazardous
winds and seas, and the potential for a few thunderstorms from mid
to late week.

&&

.MTR WATCHES/WARNINGS/ADVISORIES...
CA...None.
PZ...Small Craft Advisory until 9 PM PST this evening for PZZ570.

     Small Craft Advisory from 9 AM this morning to 9 PM PST this
     evening for PZZ575.
