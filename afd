...New UPDATE, MARINE...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 304 AM PST Sat Nov 16 2024

Cool temperatures and clear skies continue today. Quick shot of
rain Sunday and overnight into Monday, then very cold temps once
again Monday night. Subtle warming trend trough the end of the
week with additional but uncertain rain chances into the weekend.

.UPDATE...
Issued at 900 AM PST Sat Nov 16 2024

Skies are generally clear to mostly clear this morning.
This morning`s low temperatures were cold with temperatures at or
below the freezing point observed across the interior Central
Coast, scattered in the higher elevations of the Bay Area, and a
few places in the Sonoma County valleys. The coldest temperature
recorded was at the Argyle Road PG&E station near Fort Hunter
Liggett, where a low of 20 degrees was recorded. For now, the
Freeze Warning was extended for tonight through Sunday morning in
the southern Salinas Valley and the interior mountains of Monterey
and San Benito Counties. The next forecast update will include an
investigation into any other regions that could necessitate a
freeze or frost product.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 304 AM PST Sat Nov 16 2024

Chilly temps across the region this morning as skies remain clear
and winds very light. Some small areas of stratus are popping up
on satellite along some of the coastal terrain (and seen on
webcams), but conditions are expected to remain mostly clear
through the morning. Temperatures are running right along with
the forecast as of writing, so no adjustments needed overnight,
and the Freeze Warning and Frost Advisory will stand until its
expiration at 8 AM. Today will be a beautiful fall-like day with
mostly clear skies and cool temperatures...highs in the 50s to
around 60. Large scale subsidence dominates the pattern through
today, but another transient upper low approaches through the PNW
going into Sunday morning. Temperatures will be a bit warmer
across the region tonight, but still expecting areas of frost and
freezing temperatures in the southern Salinas Valley.

.LONG TERM...
(Sunday through Friday)
Issued at 304 AM PST Sat Nov 16 2024

Rain chances increase again early Sunday with the approach of the
aforementioned upper low, but thanks to its trajectory and robust
upper level flow upstream of the trough base, it is expected to
dig south and inland fairly quickly. This would place much of the
Bay Area and Central Coast under some degree of large scale
subsidence on the backside of the trough, as well as the right
exit region of a modest jet streak...promoting further subsidence.
Therefore, any rainfall that does develop Sunday is expected to
come to an end fairly abruptly Monday morning, leaving the second
half of Monday on the drier side and mostly clear. If you have
something important planned Monday night, like a championship rec
softball game, it should be dry, but bundle up!! This combination
will again promote cold temperatures overnight Monday into Tuesday
morning, where additional and perhaps more widespread frost and
freeze hazard products may be needed. Currently expecting low
temperatures in the 30s nearly across the board, with locations
along the Bay shoreline in the lower 40s. Isolated areas in the
upper 20s in interior Monterey county. Based on the current
forecast, there is about a 60% chance of seeing low temps below
32F in the North Bay valleys, 60-70% for the Santa Cruz Mtns and
San Benito county, and 80-90% for the southern Salinas Valley and
interior Monterey county.

Through the rest of the week, a little more uncertainty has been
introduced into the forecast as a high amplitude wave develops
across the northern and eastern Pacific, and the resultant trough
lingers off the West Coast. Rainfall chances increase through the
week, beginning around Wednesday. The best chances through the
middle of the week will be for the North Bay as the better jet
energy lingers to the north. It isn`t until around Friday that an
extension of the subtropical jet moves northward around SoCal and
interacts with our system to the north. The not only helps advect
the trough eastward, but also increases rain chances further south
across the rest of the region. It still looks like there will be a
warming trend into the latter half of the week as warm, moist
southwest flow increases across the warm sector of the storm
system.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 400 AM PST Sat Nov 16 2024

High confidence for VFR conditions to prevail through the TAF
period. Onshore winds increase by this afternoon before diminishing
late this evening. A few high clouds will stream across the region
ahead of our next approaching frontal system.

Vicinity of SFO...VFR. Winds increase this afternoon to become
moderate. Onshore winds diminish late in the night and become
variable/southerly early Sunday morning.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...VFR. Onshore winds increase this afternoon
to become light to moderate. Winds diminish and become variable by
late evening.

.MARINE...
(Today through Thursday)
Issued at 900 AM PST Sat Nov 16 2024

High pressure to the west and a storm system over the Pacific
Northwest will keep northwesterly winds over the coastal waters
through the weekend. The strongest winds on Saturday will be over
the outer waters before weakening on Sunday. Another cold frontal
passage on Monday will bring the return of strong northwesterly
breezes and very rough seas.

&&

.BEACHES...
Issued at 400 AM PST Sat Nov 16 2024

Moderate to large swell will begin to subside later this morning,
with the latest buoy observations showing swell heights of 10-13
feet high at 12-14 seconds. A High Surf Advisory is in effect
through 11 AM this morning due to breaking waves up to 12-15 feet,
up to 18 feet along northwest facing beaches.

King tide season is here and will bring high tides up to 1-1.5 ft
above normal today - Monday. The late morning tide cycle will be
the one to watch, especially for exposed ocean beaches when high
surf combines with the king tide. Areas that typically flood during
king tides will very likely flood within a couple hours before to
a couple hours after the daily highest tides. The next high tide
at San Francisco is expected on Saturday at 10:43 AM, with a
height of 7.01 feet.
