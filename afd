.UPDATE...
Issued at 841 AM PDT Fri Jul 11 2025

Did a quick update to the Max T for today. Based on the how the
forecast did yesterday, a few degree cooler than observations, and
based on the 24 hour temp change so far this morning, running a
few degrees warmer than this time yesterday, opted to bring
today`s Max T up by a few degree. These increases were held to
areas away from the immediate coast. Weak onshore flow and cool
SSTs will keep temps in directly water adjacent areas moderated.
Even with the slight bump up in temp, there remains no need for
issuance of a heat advisory for today. That said, Livermore had a
Max T of 80 on July 8th and 99 yesterday. Today should be about
the same as yesterday. A jump of 20 degrees in 2 days can take a
tool on the body. Treat this heat seriously and stay hydrated and
out of the sun as much as possible.

.SHORT TERM...
Issued at 305 AM PDT Fri Jul 11 2025
(Today and tonight)

Satellite imagery and profiler data show that the marine layer
remains compressed around 1000 feet, with stratus confined to the
coastal areas and in the Salinas Valley. Expect this to remain hold
with stratus retreating to the coast by mid to late morning. Another
warm and dry day is then on tap, with high temperatures peaking in
the upper 80s to 90s for most interior locations. Conditions will be
cooler by the coast or where influenced by stratus, with highs
varying from the upper 50s to low 70s.

.LONG TERM...
Issued at 305 AM PDT Fri Jul 11 2025
(Saturday through Thursday)

No major changes to the forecast this period as upper level ridging
looks to hold into early next week. That means we can expect to see
a fairly repetitive forecast, with onshore flow leading to cooling
trend this weekend and into early next week. Upper level troughing
looks to dip back into the forecast mid week, which should usher in
additional cooling and potentially deepen the marine layer. Expect
daily cloudy nights and mornings, with clouds receding to the coast
each afternoon.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 426 AM PDT Fri Jul 11 2025

Isolated IFR around the Bay Area and fairly socked in along the
coast. Most Bay Area terminals may see some relatively brief
reductions in cigs, but low confidence thanks to shallow marine
layer. Higher confidence that the immediate coastline will at
least hold on to some stratus coverage. IFR cigs expected again
tonight along with pockets of DZ and FG.

Vicinity of SFO...VFR so far this morning with patchy IFR stratus
lingering around the Golden Gate. Low confidence, but there is a
low chance of seeing some stratus invof of the terminal through
sunrise, then high confidence in VFR through the rest of the day.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...LIFR cigs socked in along the coast and
down the Salinas Valley. Expecting to clear to VFR through 16-18Z
with moderate confidence.

.MARINE...
(Tonight through next Wednesday)
Issued at 522 PM PDT Thu Jul 10 2025

Strong northerly breezes over the outer waters will continue
through Saturday with the most hazardous conditions in the far
northwestern portion with gale force gusts and very rough seas.
Sunday and Monday will have a gentle breeze with moderate to
rough seas.

.MTR WATCHES/WARNINGS/ADVISORIES...
CA...None.
PZ...Small Craft Advisory until 3 PM PDT Saturday for Pt Arena to Pt
     Reyes 10-60 NM.

     Small Craft Advisory until 9 AM PDT this morning for Pigeon Pt
     to Pt Pinos 10-60 NM.
