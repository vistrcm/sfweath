...New UPDATE...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 348 AM PST Wed Mar 5 2025

Better chances for rain are building into the region as an upper
level low enters the region. The low is expected to exit the
region late Thursday, with shortwave ridging building for Friday
and then holding through much of the weekend. The next chance for
rain arrives Sunday.

.UPDATE...
Issued at 849 AM PST Wed Mar 5 2025

Light rain persists from Livermore to San Jose and points southward
this morning. Rainfall amounts have generally been light, not
amounting to much more than 0.10" per hour across the Central Coast.
Light rain will taper off by this afternoon and evening before rain
showers and possible thunderstorms (10-20%) return overnight and
into Thursday. The ongoing forecast remains on track this morning
with no updates anticipated at this time.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 348 AM PST Wed Mar 5 2025

For the first part of the night, rain failed to make it all way to
the ground due to a bit of a dry layer under the cloud bases,
meaning there has been plenty of virga. But as things cooled off
into the night and moisture (left over from yesterday`s dissipated
front) has begun to move inland. We`re starting to see a few
hundredths to a few tenths of an inch of rain falling around the
Monterey Bay and along the Central coast.

As of per my last few (5?) overnight forecast updates, this system
has been a bit of a weirder set up than usual. Mostly with regards
to the front decaying before it made landfall on Tuesday, then the
parent low pressure picking moisture left behind. And that low will
be really picking up the slack today and tomorrow.

The offshore moisture plume is currently being directed inland along
the Big Sur coast and Monterey Bay. Initial rains have been fairly
light, but rain rates look to increase in the mid to late morning
for the southern counties. Rainfall amounts look thinner for areas
to the North, but scattered shower activity through the day and into
Thursday will still offer good chances for light rain across much of
the Bay Area.

.LONG TERM...
(Thursday through Tuesday)
Issued at 348 AM PST Wed Mar 5 2025

Scattered showers look to persist district-wide through Thursday.
Additionally, as the low pressure builds into the Bay Area and
Central Coast, colder air begins to mix into the area. Some of that
mixing will lead to thunderstorm chances starting early Thursday and
lingering into that evening. Non-zero thunderstorm chances will be
district wide, but the peak chances (10-20%) will be around the
Monterey Bay and into the interior portions of Monterey and San
Benito counties. The environment for these storms would lean toward
locally heavier rain and the potential for hail production.

And if I haven`t covered enough precip types, let`s talk about snow.

The cold air flowing within the low pressure will reduce snow levels
to 2500 to 3100 ft. Now bear in mind, the areas with the lowest snow
levels will be in the driest portion of the low pressure, so no luck
there for snow. However, higher elevations in the Santa Lucias, The
eastern Santa Clara Hills, and in Southern San Benito Co, all have
fairly decent chances for some snow fall early Thursday as the cool
air meets that lingering moisture feed.

As of the current forecast, the remaining mid week rain adds up to:

up to 0.10" for the interior North Bay

0.10" 0.35" for the Bay Area

0.40" to 0.75" for the San Mateo Coast, the southern Santa Clara
Valley, as well as Santa Cruz, Monterey, and San Benito counties.

0.75" to 1.00" Monterey, and San Benito counties.

1" to 1.75" for the Santa Lucias and Big Sur. (with some snow mixed
in)

Behind this rain session, a short ridge builds, leading to clearing
skies, cold mornings, and warmer afternoons.

Rain looks to return on Sunday, and longer term models continue to
show the the upper level pattern pushing a series of low pressures
into the area for the nex work week. Some of the extended forecast
guidance shows signs that next week`s rains could be more impactful.
Again the longer term forecast could still see some changes, so the
prolonged wet pattern isn`t a sure thing, but be sure to keep
checking back in for updates!

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 348 AM PST Wed Mar 5 2025

Currently VFR at all terminals with light rain beginning to impact
the southernmost terminals of MRY, SJC, and SNS. Rain is expected to
increase in coverage and intensity through the morning with rain
showers expected after 00Z. Ceilings are expected to deteriorate to
MVFR with the steady rain with sub-VFR visibilities expected at MRY,
SJC, and SNS during that time. For the terminals farther north,
expect generally light rain moreso in the form of rain showers.
Winds will remain diurnal and gusty through the TAF period. A slight
chance for thunderstorms emerges towards the end of the 24-hour TAF
cycle and into the 30-hour TAF cycle which would pose the threats of
locally heavy rainfall and gusty winds, lightning, and small hail.

Vicinity of SFO...Currently VFR with northerly flow. Generally light
rain will impact the terminal through the morning giving way to rain
showers by the afternoon. Winds will remain diurnal and gusty
through the TAF period.

SFO Bridge Approach...It is highly likely that the San Mateo Bridge
Approach will experience lower ceilings and visibilities and more
rainfall than SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...Currently VFR and calm at MRY and VFR with
drainage flow at SNS with light rain impacting both terminals. Rain
will increase in intensity through the morning with light rain
expected in the afternoon and rain showers in the evening. The
terminals will likely experience sub-VFR conditions through the
morning once the higher intensity rainfall begins. Winds will remain
diurnal and gusty through the TAF period.

&&

.MARINE...
(Today through Monday)
Issued at 348 AM PST Wed Mar 5 2025

A fresh northwesterly breeze and moderate seas will prevail
today. Widespread rain is expected through the morning with rain
showers this afternoon through tomorrow. There`s a slight chance
for thunderstorms tomorrow with the primary hazards being locally
heavy rainfall and gusty winds, lightning, and small hail. A
strong northwesterly breeze and rough to very rough seas will
prevail Thursday and Friday. Moderate seas and winds are expected
Saturday before building and increasing respectively Sunday.
