...New UPDATE, MARINE...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 339 AM PDT Tue Oct 8 2024

Today marks the beginning of a gradual cooling trend across our area
that extends into the weekend. However, today`s temperatures are
still above normal, especially across some of our elevated interior
locations. A Heat Advisory is in effect from late this morning until
early this evening for the East Bay Interior Valleys, Eastern Santa
Clara Hills and the East Bay Hills.

&&

.UPDATE...
Issued at 945 AM PDT Tue Oct 8 2024

Most locations across the forecast area are undergoing cooling per
24 hour trends. However, farthest inland locations where it`ll still
be hot today like the East Bay and the Eastern Santa Clara Hills are
under a heat advisory until 7 pm this evening. The SFO-SAC pressure
gradient has increased a little since Monday, this will help result
in afternoon and early evening sea-breezes.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 339 AM PDT Tue Oct 8 2024

A progressive shortwave upper level ridge---embedded in the
broader synoptic ridging pattern---is helping to keep temperatures
above normal area wide today, especially across some of our
elevated interior locations. A Heat Advisory is in effect from
late this morning through the early evening across the East Bay
Interior Valleys, Eastern Santa Clara Hills and the East Bay
Hills. Some uncertainty remains on whether Wednesdays highs are
quite high enough, as H5 heights are mostly unchanged, however,
thickness values begin to subtly decrease across our area later in
the day on Wednesday. The only locations that may reach advisory
level HeatRisk tomorrow would be far eastern interior locations,
with a shift south from todays spots into southeast Santa Clara
County and San Benito County.

.LONG TERM...
(Wednesday through Monday)
Issued at 339 AM PDT Tue Oct 8 2024

As the synoptic pattern shifts from upper level ridging aloft to a
deepening trough off the coast of NORCAL the next couple of days,
we`ll see the marine layer get reestablished, and its influence
shift farther inland by the weekend. Deterministic guidance is
currently struggling with the depth and progression of a developing
trough that may bring some rainfall across the Bay Area and points
north as soon as late Friday night. Cluster analysis favors the
northern half of our CWA for measurable precipitation, though a
slight chance of rain (and drizzle mixed in) extends up and down our
entire coastline from late Friday night through late Saturday
night. Temperatures return closer to normal for the weekend as more
robust onshore flow brings a return of low coastal stratus and the
aforementioned rain chances.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 509 AM PDT Tue Oct 8 2024

VFR is expected to prevail through the forecast period for all
terminals, however there is a slight chance of low stratus IFR
ceilings to develop after midnight with some onshore flow and the
marine layer beginning to rebound.

Vicinity of SFO...Breezy onshore flow will develops this afternoon
and persist into the evening hours.

SFO Bridge Approach...Same as SFO, VFR with breezy afternoon and
early evening surface winds.

Monterey Bay Terminals...VFR is expected to prevail through the
forecast period but a slight chance of occasional IFR marine layer
low stratus ceilings in the predawn hours through the early half
of Wednesday morning cannot be ruled out.


&&

.MARINE...
(Today through Sunday)
Issued at 913 AM PDT Tue Oct 8 2024

Moderate to fresh northerly breezes are forecast today,
particularly across coastal waters 10 to 60 nautical miles from
shore. Moderate to at times fresh northwesterly swell persists
today, translating to hazardous boating conditions for smaller
vessels.  Hazardous conditions are forecast to persist through at
least  Friday. A passing storm system and associated frontal
boundary  will bring the next opportunity for rain with subdued
winds and  seas this weekend.

&&

.MTR WATCHES/WARNINGS/ADVISORIES...
CA...Heat Advisory until 7 PM PDT this evening for CAZ510-514-515.
