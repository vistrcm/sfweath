...New AVIATION, MARINE...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 1250 AM PDT Sun Sep 3 2023

An upper low will bring cooler temperatures, more cloud cover, and
a few light showers to the region this weekend. Quiet weather
thereafter with a slow warming trend later this week.

&&

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 1250 AM PDT Sun Sep 3 2023

A closed upper low initially over northwest CA will devolve to an
open-wave trough while progressing into the Great Basin. The primary
weather influence on our area will remain the same today with more
mid to high level cloud coverage, onshore flow, and a few light
showers. Highs region-wide should range from about 65 to 75 degrees,
with the warmest readings in the interior valleys. Lows tonight will
dip into the mid to upper 50s.

&&

.LONG TERM...
(Monday through Saturday)
Issued at 1250 AM PDT Sun Sep 3 2023

A mean troughing pattern will persist into mid week as another more
progressive low pressure area passes through NorCal. Thereafter the
upper flow regime becomes more WSW around a strengthening high
pressure ridge over the Four Corners region. This pattern should
promote a continuation of cool onshore flow initially, with a slow
warm-up late week into next weekend. Nothing looks particularly
notable in the heat department so far, but the warmest inland places
could be back into the 85 to 95 degree range towards the start of
next weekend.|

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 510 AM PDT Sun Sep 3 2023

Conditions across the area this morning are largely VFR, though
nighttime satellite imagery shows mid-level clouds continuing to
traverse the region as the upper-level low that has persisted the
last few days continues to circulate to our north. A few isolated
and light rain showers to drizzle may be possible this morning,
though generally not expecting anything widespread. Best chances are
towards Monterey Bay terminals. Light winds continue through the
mid morning, but steadily increase into the afternoon to become
onshore and around 8-12 knots. Into the evening hours, coastal
stratus and MVFR ceilings are expected to make a return as the
upper level low begins to exit the region. However, there exists
some uncertainty as to timing of stratus return. Moderate
confidence in a return in the early morning of Monday for most
terminals, slightly earlier for Monterey Bay.


Vicinity of SFO...Despite earlier thinking, conditions have remained
VFR through the night and are expected to persist through the late
night tonight. Mid level clouds will continue to be present through
much of the day. Winds expected to reach a maximum sustained speed
near 14 knots out of the west this afternoon and evening, then
decreasing into the night. MVFR ceilings look to develop near the
early morning hours of Monday, though confidence in this at this
point is low-moderate.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...VFR continues with ceilings currently
sitting around 5000 feet. MVFR ceilings not expected to develop
until towards 03Z Monday, though timing is generally uncertain.
Winds out of the W/NW up to 12 knots this afternoon.

.MARINE...
(Today through Friday)
Issued at 510 AM PDT Sun Sep 3 2023

Light southerly winds continue through at least the morning before
shifting to become northwesterly into the evening, becoming
breezy by Monday. With the return of breezy to gusty northwest
winds this upcoming week, steeper wind waves are expected by
midweek. Long period southerly swell is currently moving through
the waters alongside a new northwesterly swell train. This
northwesterly swell will slowly diminish into next week just as a
new southerly swell train builds in towards the end of this week.
