...New AVIATION...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 100 AM PDT Sat May 20 2023

Morning clouds and cool temperatures will prevail along the coast
with a robust marine layer. High pressure will bring warm
temperatures to inland areas through mid week, with slight cooling
expected thereafter. Breezy winds at times for the coastal waters
and along the coastal interface.

&&

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 100 AM PDT Sat May 20 2023

High pressure aloft will encompass much of the West with upstream
low pressure spinning over the Gulf of Alaska. Our area will be
along the western periphery of the upper ridge with modest onshore
flow provided via strengthening high pressure offshore. A relatively
deep and persistent marine layer will prevail keeping low stratus
and patchy fog in the picture for this morning with clouds slowly
clearing towards the coast by afternoon. Near-coastal locations may
have trouble clearing today however given stratus banking along the
coast and the afternoon sea breeze tending to pull them back in.
Temperatures will be seasonal today, but a touch cooler compared to
the past few days. Highs will mostly be in the 60s to 70s, with
lower 80s confined to the warmest inland valleys and across southern
Monterey and San Benito Counties. After a seasonal night with lows
in the 50s, look for similar conditions tomorrow with a slight
warming for inland areas where temperatures may creep into the mid
to upper 80s for locations closet to the Sacramento Valley.

.LONG TERM...
(Sunday through Friday)
Issued at 100 AM PDT Sat May 20 2023

The upper ridge will initially remain prominent across the area on
Sunday, but will weaken thereafter in response to upper level
troughing moving into the Pacific Northwest. A strong surface high
pressure area will center offshore from the West Coast through mid
week, with the resultant pressure gradient brining breezy conditions
to the local waters and coastal interface.

The upper trough should deepen by late week with a closed upper low
potentially evolving near central or southern CA. This has been
advertised via various deterministic model solutions recently,
although WPC cluster analysis depicts uncertainty in the amplitude
of the parent trough during this time. The deterministic GFS/ECM/GEM
have at various times advertised the potential for light
precipitation on Thursday into Friday, which isn`t impossible
depending upon how the large scale pattern plays out. That said,
around 1/2 or less of ensemble members are on board with trace
amounts, with only a handful suggesting anything measurable. This
will be worth watching in the days going forward however. Otherwise
the primary weather related changes should be cooling temperatures
and a continuation of breezy conditions given the unsettled
pattern.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 349 AM PDT Sat May 20 2023

A deep marine layer will provide IFR/LIFR stratus and BR/patchy
fog into the late morning/early afternoon. Low confidence in
clearing times for tomorrow but expect them to be on the late side
around 19-20Z. After a brief window of VFR, expect sub-VFR
ceilings to return for the coastal terminals ~01-03Z Sunday.

Vicinity of SFO...IFR ceilings overnight. Return to VFR possible
~19-20Z Saturday but low confidence in exact timing. After a
brief afternoon VFR window expect an early return to sub-VFR
ceilings ~02Z Sunday. Breezy onshore winds return tomorrow
afternoon at KSFO.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...LIFR ceilings overnight. Return to VFR
possible ~19-20Z but low confidence in exact timing. After a brief
afternoon VFR window expect a return to IFR ceilings ~01-03Z
Sunday with LIFR later that night.

.MARINE...
(Tonight through next Wednesday)
Issued at 443 PM PDT Fri May 19 2023

Breezy northwest winds continue across the coastal waters with
favored coastal jet regions getting occasional gale force gusts
during the afternoon today. Winds expected to increase over the
northern outer waters starting Sunday lasting into midweek next
week with gale force gusts likely, primarily north of Point Reyes.
These strong winds will lead to steepened wind wave heights.
Additionally, a long period southerly swell 3 to 5 feet at 15 to
16 seconds continues through the waters and will slowly decay into
the weekend.
