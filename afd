.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 1232 AM PST Thu Nov 21 2024

Key Messages:

-Numerous Flood Advisories cover the North Bay
-Flood Watch in effect for the North Bay through Saturday morning
-Wind Advisory in effect through early Thursday
-High Surf Advisory in effect through Friday morning

A classic atmospheric river is in full display as a narrow band of
water vapor, clouds, and rain stream across northern California.
This feature is more or less unmoving, keeping the major impacts
focused north of the Golden Gate. Once it started, the rain really
never backed off in the North Bay. 24 hour rainfall totals are
quite impressive, with 7.07" at the Santa Rosa airport and a few
reports over 10" in the coastal mountains of Sonoma County. As
expected, the rain totals drop off quickly south of the Golden
Gate, and Downtown San Francisco has only recorded 0.39" so far.

This trend will continue through Thursday. There may be a slight
decrease in the amount of North Bay rain today, but it`s still
looking like another washout by any measure, with 1-3" in the
valleys and up to 6" in the mountains over the next 24 hours. This
prolonged rain will continue to fill creeks and streams and flooding
concerns persist in the North Bay.

Strong southerly winds will also continue, and the combination with
heavy rain will lead to downed trees and potential power outages.
The winds are expected to decrease a bit today as the gradient
relaxes, but they won`t improve substantially until Friday evening.

For the rest of the Bay Area, the southerly flow is causing warm air
advection, and tomorrow will be surprisingly warm and humid under
overcast skies. Some rain is expected for areas north of San Jose,
but will be much lighter and more spotty. The Central Coast will
stay dry, with a few sun breaks. Your time will come on Friday as
the cold front finally pushes through and brings more widespread
impacts.

.LONG TERM...
(Friday through Wednesday)
Issued at 1232 AM PST Thu Nov 21 2024

If we zoom out on the current satellite loop, a new surface low is
being born in the cold air mass out in the Eastern Pacific. This
system is under a ~130 kt jet stream, which is causing plenty of
divergence aloft and thus lowering the surface pressure. This system
will undergo explosive cyclogenesis as it moves towards the
Pacific Northwest and occludes by Friday. The associated cold
front will come ashore on late Friday or early Saturday, bringing
another bout of heavy rain and strong winds in the prefrontal
environment through the day Friday. After the front passes, the
atmospheric river will end, but the rain won`t stop. Convective
showers are expected Saturday, though the threat of thunderstorms
has decreased to around 10%. Moderate rain is expected Sunday and
Monday as well, but the uncertainty is much higher. The active
weather pattern looks like it will continue into next week with a
series of weaker low pressure systems and fronts brining periods
of rain through the week. We don`t have a dry day in the full 7
day forecast.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 222 AM PST Thu Nov 21 2024

Gusty S/SE winds continue through the period as the strong
atmospheric river churns away into the North Bay. Rainfall becomes
more scattered today but will remain persistent enough to keep in
the TAFs for North Bay terminals. A bit more sporadic for the Bay
Area today. Winds generally gusting to 20-25 kts, the higher end
being coastal terminals and low elevation sites near NW-SE
oriented valleys. Higher confidence in an MVFR forecast for most
terminals north of the Monterey Bay, with North Bay sites
potentially going down to IFR cigs in between rain showers. More
persistent heavy rain enters the forecast Friday morning.

Vicinity of SFO...Gusty SE winds 23-27 kts through much of today.
Rainfall expected to remain scattered this morning before
subsiding this afternoon. Widespread heavy rain to enter the
forecast Friday morning. Moderate-high confidence in MVFR cigs
through the period, occasional IFR vis possible Friday during
heavy rain.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...Breezy S/SE winds through the
period...generally between 12-18 kts this afternoon, higher for
KSNS (23-27 kts). Chance for scattered showers through this
morning and midday. Moderate-high confidence in MVFR cigs this
evening as tomorrow`s cold front approaches, along with heavy rain
Friday.

.MARINE...
(Tonight through next Tuesday)
Issued at 842 PM PST Wed Nov 20 2024

Heavy rain and strong winds continue primarily across the northern
waters tonight into early Friday morning before pushing
southeastward Friday. Very rough seas up to 20 feet in the
northern zones are  propagating south through the coastal waters.
Gusty gale-force winds to near storm force winds are expected
across the waters tonight and linger into late week.
