.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 200 AM PDT Tue May 7 2024

Very few low clouds this morning, mainly favoring the Monterey Bay
region. Low clouds are likely to dissipate by early morning however.
Afternoon temperatures will be closer to normal (within 1-5 degrees)
yet still will be on the cooler side. Overall, expecting a mostly
sunny day with the possibility of a few passing high clouds.
Overnight conditions will cool into the mid-to-upper 40`s and lower
50`s near the San Francisco Bay. Do expect less in the way of cloud
cover tonight as the airmass aloft continues to dry.

.LONG TERM...
(Wednesday through Monday)
Issued at 200 AM PDT Tue May 7 2024

Warming trend kicks off on Wednesday with temperatures warming into
the lower 80`s in the warmest interior spots. Meanwhile, mid 60`s to
mid-to-upper 70`s are expected elsewhere across the region. Off
shore winds also return to the region Wednesday morning and will
continue through Thursday morning in the region`s peaks of the North
Bay and East Bay. Gusts could reach or exceed 50 mph in the highest
peaks.

By Thursday and more so Friday, temperatures are expected to
approach 90 degrees in the farthest inland spots. Slight cooling is
expected near the coast on Saturday, yet the interior will remain
similarly warm. Onshore flow returns to the region by late in the
weekend with a general cooling trend. However, temperatures will
still remain in the low-to-mid 80`s across the interior to upper
50`s to 60`s near the coast.

From previous forecaster: "All in all should be a very nice second
half of the week for everyone. That being said, folks should still
exercise caution when enjoying time outdoors as this swing from
below normal to above normal temperatures can catch people off
guard. Plan to pack some extra water and sun protection if you`re
planning to spend time outdoors. And the most important preparation
if you`re going to the coast or relaxing poolside...SUNSCREEN!!!"

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 448 AM PDT Tue May 7 2024

VFR prevails through the TAF period. Moderate to strong N/NW winds
will help to mix out any stratus and clouds, leaving behind clear
skies. That being said, winds will be strong and locally gusty at
terminals nearest to the coast this afternoon, with occasional
gusts up to around 25 knots at the strongest. Into the evening of
Tuesday, winds will slowly ease near the immediate surface, though
will remain elevated within the first 2000` and begin to develop
a more northerly component. As such, have introduced wind shear
for select terminals into the last portion of the TAF period.
These stronger winds aloft are expected to mix down, with surface
winds strengthening into the mid to late morning of Wednesday.

Vicinity of SFO...VFR prevails through the TAF period. Strong and
gust N/NW winds this afternoon, gusting to around 25 knots. Gusts
begin to cease into the late evening, though winds are expected to
remain above 7 knots through the night. Towards the early morning of
Wednesday, winds aloft strengthen and turn to become more N/NE while
winds at the surface are slow to respond, remaining below 10 knots
through about sunrise.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...VFR prevailing through the TAF. A FEW low
clouds are beginning to crowd the KSNS terminal, but highest
confidence is in maintaining VFR. Winds out of the NW this afternoon
and breezy. A few gusts above 15 knots are possible, but at this
time, not expected to be frequent enough to warrant including in the
TAF.

.MARINE...
(Today through Sunday)
Issued at 842 AM PDT Tue May 7 2024

Strong northerly winds continue through the midweek, with gale-
force  gusts expected over the outer waters and near the Big Sur
coast.  Towards the early Thursday morning, winds slowly ease to
become  fresh to moderate. However, as a result of strong winds in
the early  portion of the week, significant wave heights will
build to heights  of 15 to 16 feet over the outer waters by mid-
week. Sea conditions  will be hazardous Tuesday and Wednesday with
gale warnings issued  for portions of the coastal waters. By the
late week into the  weekend, winds ease to become gentle,
significant wave heights  gradually diminish to 5 to 7 feet, and
dry weather continues as high  pressure dominates.
