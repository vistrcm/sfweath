.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 103 AM PDT Tue Aug 29 2023

Temperatures continue to rise, peaking on Wednesday with inland
highs in the mid 90s to lower 100s. Breezy and locally gusty winds
build today into Wednesday. Dramatic cooldown on Friday, with
temperatures below the seasonal average through the upcoming weekend.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 103 AM PDT Tue Aug 29 2023

The upper level ridge continues to build across the state, with high
temperatures continuing to rise as a result. Low temperatures this
morning remain in the mid 50s to the lower 60s for the lower
elevations, with the higher elevations seeing morning lows in the
mid 60s to lower 70s. Highs today range from the upper 60s to lower
70s along the coast, the upper 70s to the lower 80s on the Bayshore,
and into the 90s in the inland valleys. A surface high pressure
starts to develop over Oregon and northern California, and combined
with a trough over the Central Valley, will create breezy
northwesterly flow today, with wind gusts up to 25 to 35 mph through
the valleys. For more information on the fire weather implications
of the gusty winds, see the fire weather section of the
Discussion.

.LONG TERM...
(Wednesday through Monday)
Issued at 103 AM PDT Tue Aug 29 2023

The upper level ridge, and consequently the warm temperatures, peak
on Wednesday, with coastal regions seeing highs from the upper 60s
to the mid 70s, the Bayshore seeing highs in the 80s, and the
interior valleys rising to the mid 90s to lower 100s. Lows remain
relatively stable through Thursday morning, with mid 50s to lower
60s for the lower elevations and mid 60s to lower 70s above the
marine layer. Breezy winds will continue into Wednesday, tapering
off as the surface high over Oregon moves off to the east.

An upper level low develops over the Pacific Northwest later on
Wednesday and migrates south, resulting in a rather rapid decrease
in temperatures through the end of the work week. Highs on Thursday
will represent a slight cooldown with coastal highs in the mid 60s
to low 70s and the inland valleys reaching the upper 80s to mid 90s.
Friday will represent a more significant cooldown, as a cold front
will develop to our north and come through the region. Coastal areas
will see highs drop to the 60s, while the interior valleys rise to
the mid to upper 70s, perhaps at or slightly above 80 in the warmest
places. On Sunday the highs will start to rebound, but that will
mean that the interior valleys will see highs around the mid to
upper 80s by the beginning of next week.

The other concern with the approaching cold front is a low
confidence for showers or drizzle Friday into the weekend --
emphasis on low confidence. Ensemble models still suggest the
possibility for... something during that period, but whether
anything will fall, when it will fall, and how much is an open
question. Right now the highest probabilities for rain appear to be
to our north, towards northern California and the Pacific Northwest.
Whether any of that rain makes it south to us remains to be seen.
The highest probabilities for rain appear to be focused on the
higher elevations of the coastal North Bay, where probabilities of
precipitation peak at around 20-30%. This is something to watch as
of right now, and we`ll continue to refine the forecast as the event
comes closer.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 423 AM PDT Tue Aug 29 2023

VFR through the TAF period for all but the Monterey Bay terminals
and OAK, which will offer IFR-MVFR conditions into the mid
morning. Winds stay breezy along the immediate coast and at SFO
while surface winds for most areas stay light through much of the
morning. Winds aloft remain strong, particularly in the North
Bay, causing LLWS concerns at STS through much of the morning.
Widespread VFR and increasing surface winds are expected for
the afternoon. Surface winds will reduce into Tuesday night, but
another round of LLWS will be possible in the North Bay as winds
aloft keep their strength.

Vicinity of SFO...VFR through TAF period. Winds stay moderate to
breezy through much of the morning. These winds increase into
afternoon, gusting above 30 kts. Expect gusty conditions to last
into the night before reducing.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...IFR conditions are expected as fog and
low stratus linger over the bay through much of the morning, then
clearing towards the late morning. VFR and moderate winds are
expected for the afternoon with winds decreasing into the night.
VFR lasts beyond the TAF period.

.MARINE...
(Today through Sunday)
Issued at 423 AM PDT Tue Aug 29 2023

Strong northwest winds continue across much of the waters with
near gale to gale conditions expected in the southern waters. Into
the afternoon, gale force gusts are expected to build across the
outer waters and last through Thursday with gentle to moderate
winds expected for the weekend. Light southerly swell at 11-14
seconds persists, in addition to light northerly swell. Steep wind
waves are expected as a result of gusty winds.

&&

.FIRE WEATHER...
Issued at 0431 AM PDT Tue Aug 29 2023

Elevated fire weather concerns across portions of the North Bay
through Wednesday due to increasing northerly winds and poor
humidity recoveries. A high pressure will build over OR/NorCal
with lower surface pressure over the Sac Valley, causing strong
north to south pressure gradient. Expect strong northerly winds
Tuesday afternoon and peaking Wednesday morning/afternoon. Winds
will be strongest over the higher peaks of Sonoma and Napa,
especially over favored peaks like Mt St Helena. Humidity
recoveries will be poor Tuesday night into Wednesday, but do not
get critically low. A few spots in the higher elevations will
approach critical levels (less than 30%), but it won`t be very
widespread. Lastly, predicted ERCs for the North Bay stay near or
below seasonal averages.
