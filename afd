.UPDATE...
Issued at 922 AM PDT Sat Aug 16 2025

The short term forecast was updated this morning to concentrate
the coverage of drizzle/very light rain near and south of the
Golden Gate Bridge this morning. Noticeable onshore flow, as
evidenced by wind gusts in excess of 25 knots at KSFO, continues
and will persist through the day today. With the depth of the
moist layer between 1500-2000 ft per ACARs data from KOAK in
tandem with convergence associated with frictional differences
between the ocean and land, widespread drizzle has resulted. In
fact, downtown San Francisco and Half Moon Bay have reported
measurable rainfall, with KHAF just under 0.10" of accumulation of
a moderate to heavy drizzle and/or very light rain. I anticipate
that coastal drizzle will continue along the aforementioned
corridor through at least early afternoon.

.SHORT TERM...
Issued at 236 AM PDT Sat Aug 16 2025
(Today and tonight)

Tonight`s forecast was brought to you in part by caffeine. Winds
across the region have peaked and have begun to reduce, but will
stay breezy in the interior East Bay for Saturday. Cloud cover
continues to build with drizzle and light rain affecting the
coast. A fair bit of polishing was done to the drizzle/light rain
chances into the morning and lingering into Saturday afternoon.

These precip chances come from some warm sector moisture ahead of a
cold front. Said cold front was associated with an atmospheric river
that affected the Pacific Northwest earlier today, but has since
lost much of its strength. So for us, it`ll cause cloudy and drizzly
conditions with some moments of light rain possible this morning.
Cloud cover will struggle to erode, with only the interior areas and
higher elevations seeing clearing skies. Short term models also hint
at coastal areas keeping drizzle chances through the day with
patches of fog; a very Fogust-like day for the 16th of August.
More organized rain chances look to stay to the North, but there
is a slight chance for some showers to move into the northernmost
portions of Napa and Sonoma counties into the evening along the
front itself. However if these showers break into the North Bay
counties, they don`t look particularly impactful.

Slightly drier air arrives behind the front tonight, leading to less
drizzle chances, and not as widespread cloud cover (but still fairly
cloudy for the coast, bays and immediate valleys).

.LONG TERM...
Issued at 236 AM PDT Sat Aug 16 2025
(Sunday through Friday)

Sunday sees continued cooling in the post-frontal environment,
making it the coolest day of the forecast for most of the CWA. The
pattern then begins changing to a ridge set up into the work week,
leading to some slight warming and less cloud cover for Monday. The
warming trend looks to continue through the work week as the ridge
builds and the marine layer compresses and retreats. As of the most
recent forecast update, Thursday and into the weekend look to see
the far interior break into the 100s. Confidence in this warming
trend is increasing amongst the longer term models, but the timing
of when the heat breaks and the next cooling trend is still hard to
narrow down. There are some hints that this ridge won`t be quick to
push east, meaning the heating could last through that weekend and
into the next week. This will be something worth checking back in on
as the forecast continues to update.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 421 AM PDT Sat Aug 16 2025

Currently a mixed bag of LIFR-VFR at the terminals with a marine
layer of 1,200 feet. Nuanced TAF period ahead with a tale of two
weather phenomena. The inconsistent and abnormal presentation of
stratus is a tangible representation of dry air getting entrained
into the marine layer. This is a result of the strong northerly
(drying) winds from yesterday that are still at least somewhat
present aloft as observed by wind profilers and ACARS soundings.
Towards the end of the TAF period, a cold front will sweep across
the region, which depending on the robustness of the marine layer
and the cold front, could mix things out entirely. Needless to say,
guidance/models are extremely pessimistic on VFR being achieved
through the TAF period at bayside and coastal terminals.

Vicinity of SFO...Currently VFR with gusty westerly winds. An MVFR
ceiling has been intermittent overnight, but satellite trends leads
me to believe that the terminal will fill back in this morning. Moderate
(20-50%) confidence on the terminal achieving VFR at all this TAF
period with models/guidance suggesting low stratus clouds
lingering.

SFO Bridge Approach...40% probability that low stratus clouds linger
across the San Mateo Bridge Approach through the TAF period.

Monterey Bay Terminals...Currently IFR with westerly flow at MRY and
IFR with northwesterly flow at SNS. Moderate (60%) confidence on the
terminals remaining sub-VFR through the TAF period, likely fluxing
between IFR and MVFR. Westerly winds will prevail through the TAF
period.

.MARINE...
(Today through Thursday)
Issued at 922 AM PDT Sat Aug 16 2025

The overall sea state will be dominated by moderate to fresh
northwest breezes, with northwesterly seas of 4 to 6 feet. Periods
are anticipated to hover around 5 to 7 seconds through tonight.
Hazardous boating conditions, due to steep to very steep waves are
likely to ensue, largely for smaller vessels and crafts across
area waters, including the bays. After tonight, periods are
anticipated to increase closer to 10 seconds which should help
decrease the overall steepness of waves, though boating conditions
may still remain hazardous. Otherwise, secondary southerly swell
will persist, courtesy of recent tropical activity in the eastern
Pacific. Southerly swell periods are anticipated to average
between 12 and 16 seconds with wave heights around 2 feet or less.
