...New UPDATE...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 102 AM PST Wed Feb 14 2024

A cold front will quickly move through the region today, bringing
light rainfall accumulations and brief, gusty southerly winds.
Thursday and Friday will be mostly dry. Potentially more
impactful rain is expected to begin early Saturday with unsettled
weather continuing into early next week, which increases the
chance for flooding concerns by late weekend into next week.

&&

.UPDATE...
Issued at 806 AM PST Wed Feb 14 2024

Post frontal rain showers are developing ahead of an approaching
front this morning. The front is anticipated to move through the
North Bay by late morning and then progress southward through the
afternoon and evening. Rainfall amounts are expected to total up to
0.75-1.25" in the coastal ranges, 0.50-1.00" in the North Bay
Valleys and East Bay Hills, and 0.10-0.50 elsewhere. Drier
conditions return by Thursday morning with additional rainfall
expected over the weekend.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 102 AM PST Wed Feb 14 2024

The respite from wet weather will soon be coming to an end as our
next round of precip approaches off the Pacific. An incoming,
relatively weak frontal boundary associated with a surface low
offshore the Pacific NW will approach the Bay Area late this
morning, bringing more rain and gusty southerly winds. This
boundary will push south/southeast fairly quickly through the day
today, so expecting the stronger winds with gusts of 25-30 mph (up
to 45 mph across highest peaks) to be short-lived during the time
of frontal passage. Due to its quick-moving nature and limited
moisture supply, we`re still expecting rainfall amounts to be on
the lighter side with generally 0.25"-0.75" (locally higher for
coastal mtns up to 1"). As a result, minor weather impacts are
expected with wet roadways and minor nuisance flooding being the
main concerns today. While gusty winds will not last long, cannot
rule out an isolated downed tree or two especially given anomalous
soil moisture values across much of coastal CA (per CPC daily
calculated soil moisture ranking).

.LONG TERM...
(Thursday through Tuesday)
Issued at 102 AM PST Wed Feb 14 2024

Rain tapers off tonight but some lingering showers possible into
Thursday morning. The remainder of the day Thursday through most
of Friday will be dry as transient ridge develops then pushes
east.

Another frontal boundary will approach the area late Friday/early
Saturday in association with a strong Gulf of AK low. This system
has better jet dynamics (i.e. better large-scale ascent),
moisture supply, etc., meaning that this system will be stronger,
bringing periods of moderate to heavy rain Saturday into Sunday as
well as more widespread gusty winds. Dangerous beach/surf
conditions are also expected this weekend thanks to a large incoming
westerly swell.

A brief break in the rain is expected early Sunday (timing may still
change), but unsettled weather is expected to resume later in the
day Sunday into early next week as a strong upper low off the
Gulf of AK drops south and approaches the CA coastline. This
system has trended wetter in ensemble guidance and is reflected in
the official forecast, but some uncertainty in rainfall amounts
remains especially beyond Sunday. While there is good agreement
among ensemble clusters in the scenario of a deep upper low
approaching the CA coast by Sun-Mon, there`s still some disagreement
in its strength and how long it lingers off the coast.

With back-to-back systems (Sat-Sun then Sun-Tues), flooding
concerns are higher especially for the Sun-Mon timeframe. There`s
generally still low potential for main stem river flooding by
early next week, but ensemble guidance via the CNRFC shows
elevated probabilities early next week. For example, the San
Lorenzo River at Big Trees has a 23% chance of reaching flood
stage by Monday afternoon and Russian River at Guerneville with a
33% chance of hitting flood stage by Tuesday morning. In addition
to minor to moderate flooding concerns, strong and gusty southerly
winds are expected again, increasing the chance for downed trees
and potential power outages.

We are still many days out so uncertainty remains for the final
system (Sun-Tues), but we have higher confidence that minor to
moderate flooding will be likely this weekend into next week.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 340 AM PST Wed Feb 14 2024

A mix of IFR, MVFR and VFR across the terminals early this
morning as cloud layers associated with an approaching cold front
move in. This front is quick-moving and will drop down from the
northwest today bringing widespread rain with MVFR ceilings and
visibility to a majority of the terminals. Southerly winds will
be strong ahead of the cold front before decreasing and shifting
to a moderate SW breeze behind the front. While the main band of
rain will be confined to a 3-6 hour window, scattered showers are
possible before and after frontal passage.

Vicinity of SFO...Currently VFR with gentle southerly winds. Winds
will gradually ramp up through the day, with frontal passage
expected around 00-02 UTC. The cold front will bring rain, an
MVFR ceiling, and MVFR visibility along with it. Winds will shift
to a moderate SW breeze behind the front as the steady rain turns
to scattered showers for Wed evening.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...Currently VFR with drainage flow at both
terminals. Winds will ramp up out of the south this afternoon
preceeding and throughout the afternoon cold frontal passage. The
cold front will bring rain and MVFR ceilings along with it.

.MARINE...
(Today through Monday)
Issued at 340 AM PST Wed Feb 14 2024

A quick-moving cold front will pass through the waters today,
bringing widespread rain and breezy to gusty winds. A series of
stronger weather systems are expected to move through the area
Friday into early next week, bringing more rain, stronger winds,
and elevated seas.
