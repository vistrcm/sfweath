.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 409 AM PST Wed Nov 13 2024

A busy weather week continues with periods of rain, strong wind,
high surf, minor high tide coastal flooding, and cold overnight
temperatures.

&&

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 409 AM PST Wed Nov 13 2024

Light precipitation has begun moving onshore across NorCal
overnight, with the broad moisture plume out ahead of the deepening
trough well depicted on satellite via nighttime microphysics RGB.
Upslope onshore flow along the coastal ranges will drive higher
precipitation amounts, mainly across the North Bay this afternoon
and evening with PWATs between 0.75-1". Portions of the North Bay
can expect between 0.5-1" of rainfall through today and this
evening, with lesser amounts inland and farther south through the
Bay Area and Monterey Bay seeing from a quarter of an inch to a few
hundredths. Thermal instability is limited, with CAMs indicating a
few hundred J/kg of CAPE at most, late this morning into the evening
hours across the North Bay. Any convection that may develop, should
remain isolated and short lived.

The upper trough deepens sharply overnight tonight into tomorrow,
bringing a colder airmass with it. Steeper midlevel lapse rates
tomorrow afternoon and evening could result in more isolated
thunderstorms, mainly along the coast as the primary cold front
moves south across our area tomorrow. Although coverage for
precipitation chances are widespread tomorrow, amounts are expected
to be less than a tenth of an inch.

&&

.LONG TERM...
(Thursday through Tuesday)
Issued at 409 AM PST Wed Nov 13 2024

Light rain chances will linger behind the cold front on Friday,
especially along the coast and interior locations of Monterey and
San Benito County as the trough axis becomes positively tilted and
moves inland. Drier air and increasing H50 heights will allow for
radiational cooling to drop temperatures well below freezing once
again across the southern Salinas Valley in Monterey County and
farther inland into San Benito County. A Frost Advisory or even a
Freeze Warning may be necessary for Saturday/Sunday morning over
those locations as the weekend approaches. Another more progressive
upper trough brings another round of light precipitation chances
later Sunday into early Monday, once again favoring the North Bay
with best chances. Ridging across the west sets in behind the
exiting trough by the middle of next week, bringing warmer, more
seasonal temperatures late in the extended forecast.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 441 AM PST Wed Nov 13 2024

.MARINE...
(Today through Monday)
Issued at 429 AM PST Wed Nov 13 2024

Rough seas continue through the week. Large swell early this
morning will diminish today. Large swell return Thursday and
Friday generated by a storm force low pressure system in the
Eastern Pacific. Otherwise cold upper level low pressure systems
will bring unsettled, wet weather through late week.

&&

.BEACHES...
Issued at 429 AM PST Wed Nov 13 2024

A High Surf Advisory is in effect through 6 AM this morning for
large breaking waves up to 15 ft, possibly near 20 ft along steep
NW facing beaches.

Moderate to large northwest swell return Thursday to Saturday. A
high Surf Advisory will is in effect 7 AM Thursday to 11 AM Saturday.

King tide season is here and will bring high tides up to 1-1.5 ft
above normal from Thursday - Sunday. The late morning tide cycle
will be the one to watch, especially for exposed ocean beaches on
Thursday when high surf combines with the king tide. Areas that
typically flood during king tides will very likely flood this
week.
