...New AVIATION...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 216 AM PDT Sat Aug 5 2023

Warming is expected through Sunday with areas of Moderate HeatRisk
developing for inland areas. Cooler temperatures return early
this upcoming week as upper ridge is replaced by upper trough.

&&

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 216 AM PDT Sat Aug 5 2023

Nighttime satellite imagery shows low clouds confined mostly to the
coastline, not making it as far inland as previous nights. This
makes sense given the compression of the marine layer to about 1000
feet, per area profilers. With a more compressed marine layer,
patchy dense fog is possible along the coast, specifically near the
Monterey Bay. NBM highlights a 20-30% chance of sub 1 mile vis near
the Monterey Bay up the coast to Half Moon Bay.

Zooming out, there is currently a strong, broad area of high
pressure centered over AZ/NM/TX. Models are in good agreement that
this area of high pressure will strengthen and nudge westward
throughout the day today today into southern and central CA. This
will result in rising geopotential heights/increasing thickness,
meaning a warmer airmass will be moving in (850 mb temps rising to
22 degC). Luckily we remain on the western periphery of the
strongest part of the ridge, so not expecting a super intense
warmup. However, temperatures today will still be warmer and
approach mid 90s to low 100s for interior Napa County, northern
Sonoma County, southern Santa Clara Valley, the East Bay, and
southern Monterey County. The aforementioned locations will also
see areas of Moderate HeatRisk starting to pop up today, so be
sure to practice heat safety. Tonight, overnight lows will be
warmer than usual with many spots in the upper 50s to low 60s.
Elevations above the marine layer (1000+ feet) will be warmer with
lows in the 70s.

.LONG TERM...
(Sunday through Friday)
Issued at 216 AM PDT Sat Aug 5 2023

The peak of the heat event will come on Sunday, with high
temperatures reaching the low to mid 100s across the inland valleys,
the upper 70s to mid 80s along the Bayshore, and the low to mid
70s along the Pacific coast. Low temperatures on Sunday and Monday
morning will rise into the mid 60s to lower 70s above the marine
layer, but will remain in the mid to upper 50s below the
inversion. Moderate HeatRisk persists into Sunday, meaning that a
risk of heat- related illnesses continues for sensitive
populations (children, the elderly, pregnant women, and those tho
work outside).

The upper level ridge will start to break down on Monday, causing a
slight cooldown in temperatures with highs into the mid to upper 90s
for the inland valleys, the mid 70s along the Bayshore, and the mid
to upper 70s along the Pacific coast. By Tuesday, a trough will
develop over the West coast and temperatures should return to the
seasonal average for the rest of the week. Inland valleys will see
highs in the 80s with some low 90s in the most interior locations.
The Pacific coast and bayshore should see highs in the mid 60s to
low 70s, and low temperatures should drop to the 50s for the lower
elevations and the low to mid 60s for the higher elevations.

We`re still monitoring the chance for a tropical system currently
off the southwestern coast of Mexico to migrate northward and bring
tropical moisture to California. It`s low confidence at this
time, but stay tuned for further details...

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 421 AM PDT Sat Aug 5 2023

IFR-LIFR stratus across the immediate coast, coming inland near
Point Reyes, across the SF Bay, and the Monterey Bay region and down
the Salinas Valley. A couple of patches of stratus have also formed
near APC.  Stratus continues to expand through the night, but a
compressed marine layer limits inland development. Still on track
for widespread stratus clearing around 17-19Z. Breezy onshore winds
developing this afternoon, with speeds around 10-15 knots. Expect
even less stratus development inland on Saturday evening, with
moderate to high confidence (50-80% probability) for any stratus
development in the Monterey Bay region, and low confidence for any
inland stratus across the rest of the area.

Vicinity of SFO...IFR ceilings through the rest of the night,
clearing to VFR around 17-18Z. Westerly winds developing this
afternoon with gusts approaching 30 knots. Very low confidence
(around 10% probability) for stratus development this evening into
Sunday morning.

SFO Bridge Approach...Stratus developing near San Carlos-Palo Alto
(SQL-PAO) may impact the approach path as it expands. Otherwise,
similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...IFR-LIFR stratus persists through the
night. Confidence in fog at MRY is decreasing as no reductions in
visibility have eventuated since around 03Z. However, not inclined
to improve visibilities as the ceilings remain the limiting factor.
Clearing expected around 17Z at SNS, and around 19-21Z at MRY, with
northwest winds developing in the afternoon with speeds up to 10-15
knots. IFR stratus begins to build this evening with high confidence
(60-80% probability) at MRY and moderate confidence (50-60%
probability) at SNS.

.MARINE...
(Today through Thursday)
Issued at 216 AM PDT Sat Aug 5 2023

Strong north to northwest winds continue across the outer waters
into early next week. A north-south oriented low level jet has set
up parallel to the coastline and will peak late tonight into
Sunday, persisting into Monday. This translates to increasing
surface winds into Sunday, resulting in gale force gusts over the
northern outer waters. Wind wind waves persist across the waters
and may become steep and hazardous as a result of strong winds.
Light, long period southwesterly swell and moderate period
southerly swell will continue into next week as well, slowly
diminishing.
