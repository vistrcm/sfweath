...New AVIATION...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 224 AM PST Fri Dec 1 2023

Cool, unsettled weather for the next few days followed by a
warming trend into early next week. An approaching trough of low
pressure towards the end of the next workweek will bring the
return of unsettled weather.

&&

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 224 AM PST Fri Dec 1 2023

Cool and unsettled weather will persist today with mid/upper
level troughing aloft. Temperatures will struggle to warm much
beyond the lower 60s (upper 40s to lower 50s in the highest
elevations). Breezy northerly winds are also expected especially
near the coast and in the higher elevations. A few passing high
clouds are also likely.

Tonight, warmer conditions are expected with lows generally in the
40s for much of the region. The exception will be the interior areas
of the Central Coast which will dip into the mid/upper 30s.

&&

.LONG TERM...
(Saturday through Thursday)
Issued at 224 AM PST Fri Dec 1 2023

Saturday will feature a slight chance of rain showers, mainly
over the North Bay and San Franciso Bay Area. However, wetting
rains will be spotty at best. Rain chances retreat northward as
high pressure builds in from the south on Sunday.

This will kick off a warming trend to start the next workweek as
temperatures are expected to warm into the 70s (across the
interior) by Tuesday.

Unsettled conditions return by late week as a trough of low pressure
approaches the West Coast. However, aside from coastal Sonoma
County, widespread wetting rains are unlikely.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 348 AM PST Fri Dec 1 2023

Post-frontal breezy northwest winds of 10 to 15 knots will
continue through the afternoon today across the region. VFR
conditions expected to continue through the evening as well.
Another weakening cold front will move through NorCal into the Bay
Area late tonight, bringing VCSH across the North Bay. Widespread
MVFR cigs (and isolated LIFR-IFR at KSTS) possible early Saturday
morning as moisture (PWATs) increase and flow turns W/SW,
although confidence on timing/duration of cigs is moderate at this
time.

Vicinity of SFO...NW winds prevail and will increase through the
afternoon with gusts up to 20 knots. VFR likely through tonight
with better chance for MVFR cigs developing after 13z Saturday
morning. Low to moderate confidence exists on whether or not cigs
will develop over the terminal due to disagreements among model
guidance. However current thinking is that cigs may be
intermittent Sat morning.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...Breezy NW winds of 10 to 15 knots this
afternoon diminishing by the evening. VFR through the TAF period,
but chance for MVFR cigs possible later in the morning Saturday
(after 12z).

&&

.MARINE...
(Today through Wednesday)
Issued at 224 AM PST Fri Dec 1 2023

Northwest winds will continue to diminish across the northern
waters while fresh northerly breezes will persist generally south
of Point Pinos for much of the day today with occasional gale
force gusts possible near Point Sur through the afternoon.
Moderate period northwest swell continues and will build into the
weekend. Unsettled weather through the weekend may continue to
bring intermittent rain showers across the northern waters through
the weekend. Long period northwest swell will arrive early next
week.
