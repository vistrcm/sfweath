.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 306 AM PST Wed Nov 6 2024

A Red Flag Warning remains in effect through 7 AM Thursday for
critically dry conditions and strong offshore flow. A Wind Advisory
remains in effect for the North Bay Interior Mountains through 3 PM
today for strong offshore winds of 30-40 mph with gusts up to 60 mph
and locally higher gusts of 70+ mph for locations above 2,500 feet.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 306 AM PST Wed Nov 6 2024

A Red Flag Warning remains in effect for all interior Bay Area
zones, as well as the city of San Francisco, the San Francisco
Peninsula Coast, the Bay Shoreline, and higher terrain of Central
Coast through 7 AM Thursday as strong offshore winds and critically
dry conditions continue. It is important to remember that a Red Flag
Warning is both a relative humidly and a wind decision. The higher
the relative humidity, the higher the sustained wind speed has to be
to hit Red Flag Warning criteria. The converse is also true, the
lower the relative humidity, the lower the sustained wind speed has
to be to hit Red Flag Warning criteria. For example, Fort Hunter
Liggett is reporting a relative humidity of 17% with sustained
northerly winds of 10 mph while Atlas Peak is reporting a relative
humidity of 31% with sustained northerly winds of 16 mph, both of
these are within Red Flag Warning criteria. So while winds will
diminish this afternoon, critical relative humidity will persist
through the night, allowing for Red Flag conditions to linger
through tomorrow morning.

The SFO-WMC pressure gradient is currently observed at
-10.5 mb and is expected to continue to strengthen through the
 morning peaking near -15 mb as the pressure gradient tightens
 between high pressure over the northern Great Basin and a coastal
 trough. As the surface pressure gradient tightens, it will
 support widespread strong northerly (drying) winds of 20-30 mph
 in bayside, coastal, and valley locations. The 925 mb pressure
 gradient will be supportive for strong offshore winds with gusts
 up to 50 mph in higher terrain, across ridgelines, and through
 gaps and passes. A Wind Advisory is in effect through 3 PM today
 for the North Bay Interior Mountains for offshore winds of 30-40
 mph with gusts up to 60 mph. Isolated locations like Mt. St.
 Helena will continue to gust to 70+ mph.

.LONG TERM...
(Thursday through Tuesday)
Issued at 306 AM PST Wed Nov 6 2024

Winds will diminish through the day Thursday as the cutoff low exits
to the east and the pressure gradient is allowed to relax. Poor
overnight relative humidity recovery Thursday night will allow for
critical to near-critical relative humidity to persist through
Friday. Rainfall chances are renewed by the weekend for the North
Bay as a weak cold front skirts the region. A second, stronger cold
front will bring widespread wetting rains to the area Monday.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 330 AM PST Wed Nov 6 2024

VFR through the period. Only real aviation impact will be the
winds. Previous tafs carried LLWS and see no reason to drop it.
LVK had one pirep yesterday showing some LLWS. Did tweak the LLWS
height and put the stronger winds near 2k feet. Shear will be most
likely through mid morning before the winds aloft begin to ease.

Vicinity of SFO...VFR Gusty northerly flow. Will not reach AWW.
LLWS shear poss through 15-17Z

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...VFR. Breezy NE flow, but no LLWS in the
forecast.

&&

.MARINE...
(Today through Monday)
Issued at 306 AM PST Wed Nov 6 2024

High pressure to the north will maintain northerly flow over the
coastal waters. However, winds will gradually weaken through the
day. Strongest winds will remain over the outer waters. Weaker
winds and a decaying northerly swell will lead to an improved sea
state.

&&

.FIRE WEATHER...
Issued at 350 AM PST Wed Nov 6 2024

As noted above Red Flag Warnings remain. Offshore gradient
continues to ramp up and is now near -13mb. The response at the
surface is being seeing with the highest peaks over the N Bay
gusting 50+mph. Even with RH values up a little 40-50% winds of
that magnitude will still create fire weather concerns. RH values
are much lower on the lee slopes due to the downslope flow with
values in the 20-30%. The peak winds are forecast through mid
morning then they`ll gradually weaken through the day. Lower RH
will persist keeping fire weather concerns in place. RH recoveries
Wednesday night into Thursday will be moderate to locally poor.
Winds will be much less and may not reach RFW criteria. Day shift
can coordinated with fire partners and possibly end the RFW
sooner.
