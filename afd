...New AVIATION, MARINE...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 1230 AM PDT Wed Jul 24 2024

Slightly cooler weather today with more cooling through the end of
the week. Heat Advisories are in effect for many inland areas
outside of the North Bay until 11PM tonight.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 152 AM PDT Thu Jul 25 2024

So far, as of midnight, the night remains fairly warm with
temperatures still in the 70s inland, the 60s closer to the coast,
and the upper 50s to low 60s directly along the coastline. Overnight
lows are expected to cool into the 50s for most areas except for
interior portions of the South and East Bay where temperatures will
only cool into the 60s. The marine layer remains compressed tonight
with the Fort Ord profiler showing a maximum depth of about 1000 ft
which will confine any stratus that develops closer to the coast.
Given how compressed the marine layer is, patchy fog may develop for
areas along the Monterey Bay and northern most portions of the
Salinas Valley during the early morning.

Today`s high temperatures are expected to be 2-5
degrees cooler than yesterday as the upper level ridge continues to
move eastward. As the ridge moves away, it will be replaced by an
upper level trough moving inland into the Western United States
which will contribute to a more significant temperature cool down
beginning Friday. Temperatures will be seasonal to slightly above
average today with inland highs in the 80s to mid 90s and coastal
highs in the 60s to 70s. Heat Advisories have been allowed to expire
everywhere except interior portions of Monterey and San Benito
counties. Across interior Monterey and San Benito counties,
widespread moderate heat risk and high temperatures in the upper 90s
to low 100s are expected to continue through Thursday. The Heat
Advisory will be allowed to expire at 11PM tonight with cooler

&&

.LONG TERM...
(Friday through Wednesday)
Issued at 152 AM PDT Thu Jul 25 2024

Cooler temperatures will return Friday and persist into next week.
An upper level low pressure system located off of the coast of
southern California is expected to move inland and merge with upper
level troughing already located over the Pacific Northwest. This
will allow for upper level troughing to deepen and is expected to
persist through the weekend. As a result, temperatures will drop by
as much as ten degrees on Friday compared to Thursday. While
seasonal to below average temperatures will continue through
Wednesday, we will see temperatures start to increase by 1-2 degrees
each day beginning Monday. In general, temperatures will stay in the
upper 70s to 80s inland, 60s to 70s closer to the coast, and upper
50s to mid 60s directly along the coastline. Favored hot spots in
the North and East Bay may see low 90s return as early as next
Wednesday. For interior Monterey and San Benito counties,
temperatures will increase slightly faster with highs reaching back
into the 90s to low 100s by early next week.

Looking beyond this forecast period, upper level ridging will again
start to build over the Western US by late next week (end of
July/beginning of August) with above average temperatures expected
to return. This is expected to continue into the beginning of August
with the CPC 8-14 day outlook showing temperatures leaning above
average throughout the first week of August.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 450 AM PDT Thu Jul 25 2024

Mostly VFR conditions expected outside of the immediate coast and
Monterey Bay terminals. There is still a chance for IFR ceilings
this morning at STS, SFO, and OAK, but the probability is
decreasing. Otherwise, moderate onshore winds will kick in this
afternoon before decreasing around sunset. Stratus will be more
widespread as the marine layer begins to deepen early Friday.

Vicinity of SFO...While the TAFs stay VFR today, there is a 20%
chance of IFR ceilings sometime between 13-17Z. The IR satellite
shows a thick bank of low stratus over the Pacific, with a
streamer coming through the Golden Gate. With relatively weak
onshore wind and a shallow 800 ft marine layer, SFO and OAK will
most likely be spared, but it obviously can`t be ruled out with
ceilings so close to the terminals. Otherwise moderate to fresh
onshore winds will pickup in the afternoon before decreasing in
the evening. There`s a better chance for IFR CIGS early Friday
morning.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...IFR ceilings were slow to develop this
morning, but are now firmly entrenched and should last several
hours before clearing around 17Z-18Z. Moderate upvalley winds
will develop this afternoon at SNS. Ceilings should return closer
to 06Z tonight, but after the recent forecast error, the timing is
uncertain.

.MARINE...
(Today through Tuesday)
Issued at 450 AM PDT Thu Jul 25 2024

Northwesterly breezes remain at moderate to fresh with borderline
strong gusts possible through the forecast period. Significant
wave heights will continue to abate through the forecast period.

&&

.MTR WATCHES/WARNINGS/ADVISORIES...
CA...Heat Advisory until 11 PM PDT this evening for CAZ516>518.

PZ...Small Craft Advisory until 3 PM PDT Friday for Pt Arena to Pt
     Reyes 10-60 NM.
