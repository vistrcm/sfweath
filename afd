.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 341 AM PDT Thu Sep 21 2023

NW to N winds remain entrenched through the depth of the
troposphere. These winds are continuing to transport wildfire
smoke from NW California and SW Oregon to the Bay Area. The HRRR
model suggests smoke concentration will be similar to what was
observed Wed, with the heaviest impact likely in the morning
hours.

The higher winds are causing some fire weather concerns in the
North Bay interior mountains today. Northerly winds will be
strongest through the morning, but will remain breezy through the
afternoon as the RH drops into the 25-35% range. While these
conditions are somewhat marginal, a Red Flag Warning is in effect
for the North Bay Mountains through Thursday afternoon. See the
Fire Weather Section for more details.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 341 AM PDT Thu Sep 21 2023

Enhanced IR satellite imagery is showing thin stratus in the North
Bay with extensive coverage in the Monterey Bay area. This
discrepancy is mainly due to the low over eastern Oregon, which
is inducing some dry offshore flow in the North Bay. Widespread
stratus (not smoke) clearing is expected by mid-day. While most
areas are a few degrees colder than yesterday morning, max
temperatures are expected to be very similar with upper 60s to low
70s in coastal areas and upper 70s to low 80s inland. Winds will
be gusty again this afternoon due to a strong gradient between
high pressure in the North Pacific and low pressure moving over
the Great Basin.

Deep-layer NW-N winds will continue to transport new smoke to the
area through the day. The Ft. Ord profiler is showing a marine
layer depth of about 2500 ft. This deep marine layer will give the
smoke near the surface more room to disperse and should at least
help keep air quality impacts moderate today.

.LONG TERM...
(Friday through Wednesday)
Issued at 341 AM PDT Thu Sep 21 2023

By Friday, the gradient relaxes and winds will decrease and shift
westerly. This shift will likely lead to improving air quality
through the day Friday. After the smoke clears, conditions will
be fairly standard through the weekend with morning stratus
clearing by mid-day and near normal temperatures.

Next week, temperatures are trending cooler than average through
Tuesday with highs expected to be in the mid to high 70`s inland
and high 60`s along the coast.

Confidence is increasing that the North Bay will experience some
measurable precipitation between Monday and Tuesday as a cold
front moves through the area. The current forecast calls for a
30-50% chance in the North Bay, 25-35% chance in San Francisco
and the East Bay, and less than 20% chance in the South Bay. In
addition to increasing probabilities, the estimated amount of rain
is also increasing with somewhere around 1/10" to 1/3" possible
in the populated areas of Sonoma County. It`s worth noting that
the North Bay valleys haven`t seen appreciable precipitation since
May. Stay tuned for updates as this forecast gets ironed out.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 440 AM PDT Thu Sep 21 2023

Wildfire smoke and a deep marine layer have resulted in mainly
MVFR ceilings and visibilities early this morning. These
conditions will persist for most locations through 17-19Z before
ceilings mix out to VFR. Conditions may be slower to improve by
1-2 hours however around Monterey Bay where the the marine layer
clouds are more entrenched. Winds today will be light and onshore.
Greatest potential for early evening ceilings to return is at
KMRY and KSNS; less confidence in ceiling development farther
north where marine layer clouds may be a bit more spotty.

Vicinity of SFO...VFR prevails with slight visibility reductions
in HZ/FU. Most likely forecast outcome is a continuation of VFR,
but can`t rule out a patch or two of lower stratus developing in
the vicinity this morning. Light S-SW winds initially should veer
towards the WSW-W this afternoon and evening. FEW-SCT lower clouds
develop tonight this evening but confidence in ceiling
development is too low for inclusion in the current TAFs.

SFO Bridge Approach...Reductions in slant range visibility due to
wildfire smoke and haze continuing, especially during sunset and
sunrise. Otherwise similar to KSFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...MVFR low clouds should persist through
around 18-19Z. Most likely forecast outcome suggests a clearing
window thereafter before clouds return once again during the
early to mid evening hours. Winds generally light and onshore with
some breeziness at KMRY during the afternoon hours.

.MARINE...
(Today through Tuesday)
Issued at 440 AM PDT Thu Sep 21 2023

Look for fresh to strong northerly breezes over the northern outer
waters today with gale-force gusts anticipated. Gentle to
moderate northerly breezes are expected elsewhere for the
remainder of today an tonight. A quickly strengthening low
pressure system will bring light rain chances to the northern
waters by late Monday into Tuesday of next week. Otherwise
northwesterly swell diminishes late today with anew swell train
arriving late into the weekend.

.FIRE WEATHER...
Issued at 341 AM PDT Thu Sep 21 2023

The Red Flag Warning continues through 5 pm on Thursday for the
North Bay interior mountains. The strong N to NE flow has become
established as of 1 AM this morning. A few observations in the
Mayacamas mountains are reporting wind gusts in the 35-45 mph
range including as high as 50 mph at Healdsburg Hills North
(PG303, 2480 ft) and 58 mph at Santa Fe Geothermal (PG652, 3881
ft). Gusts are also picking up in the Vaca Mountains, reaching
about 30-40 mph along the ridges. Winds are expected to decrease
in the late morning before the sea breeze brings onshore flow back
to the North Bay this afternoon. While the high elevation winds
are a little stronger than expected, relative humidity values
remain marginal and not critically low.

&&

.MTR WATCHES/WARNINGS/ADVISORIES...
CA...Red Flag Warning until 5 PM PDT this afternoon for CAZ504.

PZ...Gale Warning until 9 AM PDT this morning for PZZ570.
