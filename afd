.UPDATE...
Issued at 838 AM PDT Sat Nov 1 2025

Near term weather impacts for land and water are fog and patchy
dense fog for that matter. Decided to issue a Dense Fog Advisory
valid through 10 AM for N Bay Valleys and Southern Monterey Bay
Coast due to sensors/cams showing visby less than 1/2 mile with
pockets of just a few hundred feet. Marine layer is shallow in
floating in the 500-700 range, which is leading to the fog.
Morning satellite is starting to show some thinning of the fog
over land, but coastal waters/shoreline still show clouds/fog.
Speaking of satellite, pretty neat to pick out fog along the
Russian River in Sonoma heading west to the Pacific. Will hold
onto the Dense Fog Advisory for now, but will watch trends closely
and end it early if need. All that being said, be mindful if
you`re driving in those area and be ready for fog.

As noted below, today will be a pleasant day once the fog
dissipates. If you head to the coast, be careful as a Beach Hazard
Statement remains in effect.

Focus for the afternoon forecast package will be the refinement of
the weather forecast for the upcoming week. How much rain? When?
Wind impacts?

.SHORT TERM...
Issued at 309 AM PDT Sat Nov 1 2025
(Today and tonight)

Another pleasant day in the neighborhood with high temps 5-10
degrees above normal. Subtle marine layer compression will result in
patchy dense fog through sunrise for coastal areas and portions of
Sonoma county. Otherwise clearing out to mostly clear skies.

.LONG TERM...
Issued at 309 AM PDT Sat Nov 1 2025
(Sunday through Friday)

Honestly wishing I had more of an update on next week`s system, but
there really haven`t been any notable changes to the current
thinking. Some of the main points and features are still valid,
which I`ll mention again. Medium range guidance strongly suggests a
robust 150 kt Pacific jet will unfold across the Aleutian Islands,
which paves the way for a deep upper low to dig into the West Coast.
Ensemble cluster analysis still shows a majority of members
supporting a solution wetter than the ensemble mean. However, this
is slightly more focused on the North Bay at this time...perhaps the
most notable change in this forecast. Rainfall amounts have not
significantly changed, and neither has the range of uncertainty.
Still looking at a range of 0.75" to 1.75" (25th to 75th
percentiles) for the North Bay. Elsewhere across the Bay Area,
totals are more likely to be at the bottom end of that range, and
even lower across the Central Coast. Since it looks like we`ll be
looking at a mostly beneficial rainfall, wind may be the bigger
story here. We`re still in line for a brief gusty period Wednesday
morning as the main trough passes. Models are still supportive of 50
kt southwesterly flow at 850 mb, which would support a marginal
hazardous wind threat. Still too early to issue any advisory, but we
are evaluating the potential for a Wind Advisory Wednesday morning.
Stay tuned for updates!

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 416 AM PDT Sat Nov 1 2025

Currently a mixed bag of LIFR-VFR at the terminals. Low stratus
clouds remain along the Pacific Coast with patchy dense fog being
reported in the North Bay Interior Valleys and Monterey Bay.
Widespread VFR is expected by this afternoon with a similar signal
on tap for tonight.

Vicinity of SFO...Currently VFR with westerly flow. Moderate (60%)
confidence on VFR prevailing through the TAF period. Westerly winds
will prevail today, veering tonight to become offshore.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...Currently LIFR and calm at MRY and VFR with
drainage flow at SNS. Dense fog will linger through most of the
morning at MRY. SNS is expected to remain VFR with the help of
drainage winds keeping things mixed. There`s up to a 60% chance for
fog development tonight.

.MARINE...
(Today through Thursday)
Issued at 416 AM PDT Sat Nov 1 2025

Moderate to fresh northerly breezes will prevail through the
weekend with strong gusts for the inner waters and outer waters.
Moderate to rough seas for the inner waters and very rough seas
for the outer waters will prevail through the weekend. Conditions
improve Monday with winds diminishing to become moderate and seas
abating to become rough in the outer waters. Conditions
deteriorate Tuesday night into Wednesday morning with very rough
seas for the outer waters, rough seas for the inner waters,
strong to near-gale southerly breezes with widespread gale force
gusts, and rainfall.

.BEACHES...
Issued at 416 AM PDT Sat Nov 1 2025

A long period northwesterly swell will bring an increased risk for
sneaker waves, rip currents, and breaking waves of 12-17 feet to
Pacific Coast beaches through Monday. Sneaker waves can
unexpectedly run significantly farther up the beach than normal,
including over rocks and jetties. Rip currents are typically more
frequent and stronger in the vicinity of jetties, inlets, and
piers. Swimmers should always swim near a lifeguard. Remain out of
the water to avoid hazardous swimming conditions and never turn
your back on the ocean!
