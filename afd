.SHORT TERM...
Issued at 158 AM PST Sun Feb 1 2026
(Today and tonight)

Fog has been observed overnight in the North Bay and East Bay
Interior Valleys. High clouds streaming in from a dying cold front
are adding complexity to the fog forecast both in terms of viewing
it from space via satellite as well as seemingly not letting it get
widespread like initially thought. Still, if you are driving this
morning, slow down, use your low-beam headlights, and leave plenty
of distance ahead of you. The aforementioned cold front will be the
main feature today. Rain can be seen to the north on our neighbor
Eureka`s radar, but this is not expected to hold together down here.
Instead, what we can expect is a pause in the warming trend, a
return of onshore flow, and an extra colorful sunrise/sunset from
the cloud shield. One more round of minor coastal flooding is
expected during high astronomical tide this morning for bayshore
locations along the San Francisco Bay, San Pablo Bay, and Monterey
Bay. Hazardous beach conditions continue at Pacific Coast beaches,
read more in the BEACHES section.

.LONG TERM...
Issued at 158 AM PST Sun Feb 1 2026
(Monday through Saturday)

A warming trend commences Monday and peaks Wednesday as longwave
upper-level ridging builds into place and sets up its axis over the
region. Sensible weather wise, this will result in temperatures of
10 degrees above normal. Global ensemble clusters are in agreement
that the aforementioned ridge will begin to get shoved east on
Thursday by upper-level shortwave troughing that will skirt the
region Friday into Saturday. This will relatively cool temperatures
with no rain in the official forecast.

.BEACHES...
Issued at 333 AM PST Fri Jan 30 2026

Hazardous beach conditions will continue through Monday at all
Pacific Coast beaches. Long period westerly swell will bring an
increased risk for sneaker waves and strong rip currents with

piers, rocks, and other waterside infrastructure, remain out of
the water, and never turn your back on the ocean!
