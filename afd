...New UPDATE, MARINE...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 138 AM PDT Thu Jul 11 2024

Last stint of heat peaks today with gradual cooling into the
weekend. Heat highlights remain in effect through Friday evening.
Near normal temps by early next week. Otherwise fairly quiet
weather through the forecast period.

&&

.UPDATE...
Issued at 837 AM PDT Thu Jul 11 2024

Much less inland expansion of stratus this morning as the marine
layer has compressed to around 1,000 feet per Fort Ord Profiler.
Very warm temperatures remain in the higher elevations this morning
and will mix down to the surface late morning and throughout the
afternoon, leading to today being the warmest with only a few
degrees of cooling tomorrow. The overall forecast remains on track
with no updates anticipated this morning. Please see the previous
forecast discussion.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 138 AM PDT Thu Jul 11 2024

Decent stratus coverage this morning with the marine layer still
about 1,000 feet deep per Fort Ord profiler. Some compression has
occurred from yesterday afternoon as 500 mb heights rise and
large scale subsidence dominates. Further compressional warming is
set to take place today increasing high temps by a few degrees
over yesterday. Moderate to major HeatRisk in place for inland and
high elevation locations, and urban areas away from the immediate
coastline. Temperatures look to peak today as a bit of a remnant
low traverses up the California coast this evening, bringing in a
little bit of mid-level moisture into the weekend.

Remember these heat safety tips:

* Stay hydrated and drink plenty of fluids.
* Wear lightweight, light-colored clothing.
* Reduce time spent outdoors or stay in the shade.
* Never leave people or pets unattended in vehicles.
* Use sunscreen if going to the coast or the pool.

.LONG TERM...
(Friday through Wednesday)
Issued at 138 AM PDT Thu Jul 11 2024

The aforementioned remnant low begins to influence our area by
Friday, where we will likely see some degree of mid-to-high level
cloudiness, especially over southern portions of the area. This
will aid in bringing afternoon highs down a bit, in addition to
the low deepening the marine layer and the ridge axis migrating
eastward. This will still be a gradual cool down, so temps will
still be well above normal on Friday with moderate HeatRisk across
areas where advisories or warnings are in place. High temps
continue their gradual decline into the weekend, so the Heat
Advisory and Excessive Heat Warning will be left as is, expiring
Friday evening. By the start of next week and through the rest of
the forecast period, temperatures look to be right around seasonal
normals. The larger scale pattern advertised by ensemble guidance
would promote tranquil summer weather from this weekend beyond.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 510 AM PDT Thu Jul 11 2024

VFR everywhere except MRY and SNS where LIFR conditions continue.
Visibilities will continue to temporarily decrease at MRY and SNS
through the mid morning with visibilities down to 1SM possible. Low
to moderate confidence that lowered visibilities and LIFR CIGs will
develop in the early to mid morning at STS. Ensemble guidance is
leaning towards only few to scattered clouds at STS. However,
increasing RH at STS and observed LIFR conditions downstream of STS
at the Petaluma airport serves to increase confidence in IFR to LIFR
conditions developing close to sunrise at STS. Similar to last
night, stratus continues to look less widespread tonight with
stratus currently only expected to return at MRY and SNS. Light,
onshore flow strengthens and becomes more moderate during the
afternoon before becoming light and variable again overnight.

Vicinity of SFO...VFR through the TAF period. Satellite shows some
stratus moving through the Golden Gate into the SF Bay but
confidence remains low that it will reach SFO or OAK. Guidance
support FEW to SCT cloud development at SFO through the late
morning. Clear skies will return by late morning and continue
through the evening. Some potential for stratus to return tonight
but confidence remains low at this time given a shallower marine
layer and lack of model consensus. Northwest winds continue with
moderate, gusty winds returning during the afternoon before
weakening overnight.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...LIFR conditions continue through the late
morning. Observations at MRY and SNS have shown visibilities
temporarily decreasing to 1 to 1 1/2 SM before returning to
unlimited visibilities. Tempos are in place from 12-16Z with
temporary decreases in visibility down to 1SM expected to continue
through the late morning. Stratus coverage is will diminish by 18-
19Z with ensemble guidance suggesting stratus returning by 02-04Z.
Variable, light winds continue through the late morning with
moderate onshore flow from the northwest returning during the
afternoon.

.MARINE...
(Today through Tuesday)
Issued at 837 AM PDT Thu Jul 11 2024

Fresh to strong northerly winds continue over the northern waters
through early Saturday, then diminish to become moderate.
Occasional near gale force gusts are possible over the far
northern outer waters through late Friday evening. Significant
wave heights between 10 to 12 ft continue over the outer coastal
waters with peak wave heights between 12 to 14 ft expected over
the far northern outer coastal waters. Significant wave heights,
sustained winds, and wind gusts begin to subside below small craft
advisory criteria by the late weekend.
