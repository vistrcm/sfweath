...New UPDATE...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 301 AM PDT Wed Apr 3 2024

A cool down is forecast for Wednesday as a dry cold front sweeps
through the region. Thursday and Friday will feature unsettled
conditions with isolated to scattered rain showers, high elevation
snow showers, and possible thunderstorms. Temperatures then remain
cool through the weekend.

.UPDATE...
Issued at 936 AM PDT Wed Apr 3 2024

Morning satellite imagery looks more like summer than spring with
widespread stratus. A solid stratus push overnight brought clouds
along the entire coast and inland valleys. Depth of the marine
layer push is near 1800 feet per Fort Ord profiler and Oakland
sounding. The marine layer clouds will be slow to dissipate as an
upstream upper trough approach. Ultimately a dry cold front will
help to scour out any remains low stratus.

The bigger story will be the "summer like stratus" quickly ending
with one final push of "winter weather". The dry cold front is on
track to sweep through the Bay Area and Central Coast this
afternoon. The fropa will bring some gusty winds, but more notably
start the pattern change kicking off colder temperatures, precip,
and possible thunderstorms. For more details see below...

No update this morning.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 301 AM PDT Wed Apr 3 2024

An approaching upper level through will sweep through the region
today from the northwest. At the surface, a dry cold front will move
from north to south across the region by this afternoon allowing for
a three to ten degree cool down. Breezy and gusty winds (30-40 mph)
out of the northwest are also expected in wake of the frontal
passage.

Tonight, forecast low temperatures are expected to range from the
lower 30s in the regions highest peaks, upper 30s to lower 40s
inland, and low-to-mid 40s near the coast. This is as cold air
advection begins to settle into the region.

.LONG TERM...
(Wednesday night through next Monday)
Issued at 250 PM PDT Tue Apr 2 2024

Behind the front a much colder air mass waits in the wings. Model
ensemble members and WPC cluster analysis indicate high
confidence on a deep cold core upper low tracking down the coast
late Wednesday night through early Friday. This passing feature
will bring a marked change around the region. Let`s first take a
look at temperatures...The airmass does get some modification due
to the warmer SST, but overall it`s still anomalously cold. Model
guidance gives upper levels at 500mb -36C by late Thursday. If
this would actually verify it would be in the top 10 coldest 500mb
temps for KOAK all time and coldest April reading period.
Additionally, the anomaly on 850mb temps is -12 to -14 for early
April. Needless to say pretty unusual for April. The cold air will
do a few things: bring cold temperatures obviously, lower snow
levels, and destabilize the atmosphere. Min temperatures Thursday
will be in the 40s coast/urban areas and 30s interior (low to mid
30s higher terrain). Max temperatures on Thursday will struggle
and only reach the upper 40s to upper 50s (mid 30s to 40 higher
terrain). Even colder temperatures Thursday night/early Friday
with more 30s showing up. The combination of cold temperatures and
damp conditions will impact the vulnerable population. Max
temperatures Friday remain below normal. Not seeing much
improvement for temperatures until the weekend, and more so next
week. Snow levels: they begin to plummet Wednesday night as the
upper level cold air moves in. In fact, by Thursday snow levels
will hover around 2k feet North Bay and 2500-3000 feet elsewhere.
Pretty impressive thickness values (1000-500mb) 527-529 DAM. As
the upper low does move southward it will bring some precip to the
region. Does not appear to be a big precip producer overall.
Precip will initially move into the North Bay Wednesday night
before moving southward Thursday and Friday. Rainfall amounts will
range from: North Bay Mts and Coastal Mts 0.5-1.0" and 0.1-0.5"
elsewhere. Not a big hydro concern. However, given the low snow
levels could see some of the lowest snow of the year. Snow will
accumulate the most over the Santa Clara Hills, Gabilan Range, and
especially the Santa Lucia Range. The biggest "winners" for snow
will be the Santa Lucia range with 5-10" possible. However, could
see snow over the higher peaks of the Santa Cruz Mts (hwy
17/Skyline) and North Bay. Not expecting much accumulation, but
notable nonetheless. Lastly, thunderstorms. The cold core aloft
will help to destabilize the atmosphere Thursday and Friday.
Current forecast will mention thunderstorms with small hail. SPC
does have the region in a general mention of thunderstorms.

There will be a break in precip with slightly warmer temperatures
late Friday night through Saturday. Another, but much weaker,
upper level low drops down the coast late in the weekend bringing
another push of precip. Additional precip will be minimal.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 511 AM PM Wed Apr 3 2024

Marine layer stratus /MVFR-IFR/ continues to press inland, areal
coverage is expanding while the marine layer is showing signs of
deepening to near 2000 feet per recent profiler data at Bodega
Bay and Fort Ord. Lower level cold air advection will steadily
weaken the marine layer temperature inversion today, the marine
layer temperature inversion quite likely fully eroding by tonight.
Also, since colder air is arriving and the marine layer is deepening
this combining with upsloping winds may result in clouds producing
patchy light drizzle or very light rain. An anomalously deep and
very cold 500 mb trough for early April will continue to advance
from the northwest reaching our forecast area tonight and Thursday
resulting in a lowering freezing level, gusty winds, showers and
a few thunderstorms.

Vicinity of SFO...MVFR ceiling likely developing during the
morning, west wind increasingly gusty with gusts up over 30 knots
developing later in the morning and afternoon. VFR-MVFR tonight
and Thursday, not currently in 12z TAF however may see patchy light
drizzle or very light rain developing today or tonight due to
incoming cooling and lowering pressures. Otherwise wet weather
developing Thursday morning along with a lowering freezing level.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...MVFR-IFR stratus ceilings increasing to
MVFR during the morning with the deepening of the marine layer.
MVFR ceilings tonight and Thursday morning, not currently in 12z
TAFs however may see patchy light drizzle or very light rain
developing today or tonight due to incoming cooling and lowering
pressures. Wet weather developing near or post 12z Thursday along
with a lowering freezing level.

.MARINE...
(Today through Monday)
Issued at 301 AM PDT Wed Apr 3 2024

Northwest winds will become gusty due to a mainly dry cold front
passing southeastward across the coastal waters and bays today. A
winter-like pattern, cold air mass for early April and deep upper
level trough will move in behind the cold front resulting in a mix
of gusty winds, rough seas, heavy showers and a slight chance to
chance of thunderstorms late tonight to Friday. Another upper
level trough, not as strong as the mid to late week trough, will
arrive from the northwest possibly with a few showers Sunday.
