...New AVIATION, MARINE...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 227 AM PST Mon Nov 4 2024

Strong winds Monday will prime fuels for critical fire weather
conditions Tuesday through Thursday.

&&

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 227 AM PST Mon Nov 4 2024

High pressure building into the Pacific Northwest and an upper-level
trough digging into the Desert Southwest will be supportive of
strong winds largely on the order of 20-30 mph with gusts up to 50
mph in the higher elevations through this morning. The surface
pressure gradient will support northerly winds in bayside, coastal,
and valley locations while the 925 mb pressure gradient will support
northeasterly/offshore winds in the higher elevations. This morning
will be a primer for critical fire weather conditions tomorrow.

.LONG TERM...
(Tuesday through Sunday)
Issued at 227 AM PST Mon Nov 4 2024

While 10-hour live fuel moisture is not quite to < 6% (the threshold
needed for fire weather products), due to the nature of the
northerly (drying)/offshore (compressional warming) winds, it is
expected that 10-hour live fuel moisture will become < 6% going into
tomorrow as the latest observations show as low as 8%. Thus, a Red
Flag Warning has been issued for all interior Bay Area Zones, as
well as the city of San Francisco, the San Francisco Peninsula
Coast, the Bay Shoreline, and higher terrain of Central Coast from
11 AM Tuesday through 7 AM Thursday. High pressure building into the
Pacific Northwest and a reinforcing trough digging into the Desert
Southwest will lead to critical fire weather conditions Tuesday
morning through Thursday morning. Critically dry conditions and
northeasterly/offshore winds largely on the order of 20-30 mph with
gusts up to 50 mph can be expected during this timeframe. High
pressure to the north of low pressure to the south forms something
called a Rex block, this pattern in and of itself comes with a lot
of uncertainty as the onset and decay is not handled well by
numerical weather models. As for this specific setup, uncertainty
lies in the location and strength. Global ensemble clusters are in
agreement that this upper-level trough becomes a cutoff low and that
it will slowly start to progress east Thursday afternoon, lowering
fire weather concerns into the weekend.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 346 AM PST Mon Nov 4 2024

VFR through the TAF period. As high pressure continues to build, clear
skies will dominate with a slight chance for haze. Light and
variable winds this morning will organize into a moderate sea
breeze this afternoon. There is a strong NNE breeze above 1,000
ft, which may lead to an occasional stronger gust at the
terminals, and moderate low-level turbulence throughout the day.

Vicinity of SFO...High confidence VFR through the day. Light NE
winds at SFO will yield to a moderate sea breeze this afternoon.
Despite the shifting surface winds, NNE winds will persist at
flight level, likely producing some low-level turbulence.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...VFR conditions will prevail through the
TAF period. Offshore drainage winds will flip around in the late
morning and persist through the early evening.

.MARINE...
(Today through Saturday)
Issued at 346 AM PST Mon Nov 4 2024

The subtropical high pressure over the Eastern Pacific will
continue to move towards our coastal waters over the next couple
days. The gradient between this system and a low pressure trough
over California will support strong NNW winds with gale force
gusts across the majority of the exposed marine zones. While the
winds will remain strong, the long period NW swell will gradually
abate over the next 24 hours, allowing the significant wave
heights to abate from very rough to rough.

&&

.FIRE WEATHER...
Issued at 1234 PM PST Sun Nov 3 2024

The first of two pushes of offshore flow is upon us, with gusty
north to northeast winds expected to continue through Monday
morning. Although recent rainfall will help alleviate fire weather
concerns in the short term, the dry winds will help cure the fuels
in advance of a second offshore wind event beginning Tuesday
evening. The models are converging on a moderate to strong offshore
flow event during the midweek, but there`s still considerable
uncertainty on how severe the fire weather concerns will be. A lot
of the fire weather concerns that will develop from this second
system will depend on how dry the fuels become after this first push
tonight. In addition, the relative humidity forecasts from Tuesday
through Thursday may still need to be nudged downward to account for
some lost evapotranspiration potential from tonight`s drying winds.
There was some discussion about issuing a Fire Weather Watch for the
midweek event, but our colleagues in Eureka and Sacramento agreed
that with so much uncertainty in how the fuels would react to the
conditions tonight, it was best to hold off on issuing anything
until Monday.
