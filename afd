.UPDATE...
Issued at 430 AM PDT Tue Mar 18 2025

Quick update for the Tuesday morning Frost Advisory. The North Bay
is finally seeing temperatures drop into the 30s and it looks like
the Frost Advisory will verify. However, farther south across the
interior Central Coast, temperatures are struggling to drop.
Breezy northwest winds and persistent upslope clouds are limiting
the temperature drop. In fact, a few spots are currently 8-10
degrees warmer than forecast. Therefore, the Frost Advisory for
Interior Monterey/San Benito has been canceled. Still have higher
confidence that colder temperatures return Tuesday night into
Wednesday with less winds and clouds.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 151 AM PDT Tue Mar 18 2025

Radar imagery is showing some lingering showers across the northern
Santa Lucia range, the byproduct of bay effect processes where
moisture from Monterey Bay interacts with the higher terrain to
enhance the shower activity, and across the higher elevations of San
Benito and interior Monterey Counties. The shower activity is
relatively light, with only a few hundredths of an inch of
additional rainfall totals, and is expected to diminish over the
rest of the night. The rest of the region varies from mostly clear
skies over the North Bay, into generally higher elevation stratus in
the Bay Area and down into the Central Coast. This stratus is
expected to continue diminishing through the night, mixed out by
breezy winds aloft. Thus, temperatures are expected to dip through
sunrise. A Frost Advisory is in effect this morning through 9 AM in
the North Bay interior, the southern Salinas Valley, the Santa Lucia
range, and the mountains of San Benito and interior Monterey
counties. Temperatures in these areas reach into the lower to middle
30s, Elsewhere, lows this morning range from the middle 30s to the
lower 40s in the inland valleys, and the lower to middle 40s along
the coast.

Clear skies and light winds are expected today with a shortwave
ridge passing through the region. Highs range from the lower to
middle 60s in the inland valleys, the upper 50s to the lower 60s
near the bays, the lower to middle 50s along the Pacific Coast, and
the upper 40s to middle 50s in the higher elevations.

.LONG TERM...
(Wednesday through Monday)
Issued at 151 AM PDT Tue Mar 18 2025

Chilly morning temperatures are expected to continue into Wednesday,
with temperatures around the same as those expected this morning. A
new Frost Advisory has been issued for Wednesday morning from 2 AM
to 9 AM for the North Bay interior and the interior Central Coast.
Light rain arrives in the Bay Area later on Wednesday, the fringes
of a system that will bring impactful rain and snow to the Pacific
Northwest and northern California. Across our region, beneficial
impacts are expected. Rain totals have trended downwards over the
last few model runs, with 0.2-0.3" expected in the Sonoma coastal
ranges and the Mayacamas, 0.05-0.15" in the North Bay valleys, up to
0.1" in the Bay Area and the Santa Cruz mountains, and virtually
nothing in the Central Coast. Further rain systems are expected
through the end of the week up north, but any impacts to the region
are limited to transitory drizzle across the northern fringes of
Sonoma and Napa counties.

A gradual warming trend is expected through the week as an upper
level ridge builds over the western United States. Temperatures will
generally tick up on Wednesday with the inland valleys reaching
highs in the middle to upper 60s, except in the North Bay where the
fringe influence from the storm system will cause temperatures to
dip a couple degrees, with the valleys reaching the upper 50s.
Temperatures in the North bay recover the next day, and by the
weekend, most of the forecast region will see temperatures near or
slightly above the seasonal average, with temperatures reaching the
lower to middle 70s in the inland valleys and the lower to middle
60s along the coast. Temperatures early next week will be even
warmer, and the current forecast calls for the inland valleys to
reach (do we dare say it?) the 80s next Monday and Tuesday.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 421 AM PDT Tue Mar 18 2025

A much more favorable day for aviation activities compare to 24
hours ago. For the most part, VFR condition with a smattering of
MVFR around Monterey Bay. Moist low level flow is allowing for
cold cu popping up over the Santa Clara Valley (on the edge of
SJC) and the terrain of Monterey/San Benito. Expect this to
persist into the afternoon. As for the big three terminals,
SFO,OAK,SJC, VFR in the TAFs. A few cigs may drift over SJC if
this does play out will need to AMD with a tempo. MRY and SNS will
hold onto to SCT and BKN into the afternoon.

Vicinity of SFO...VFR. Onshore flow will increase this afternoon,
but remain under 20kt.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...SCT to BKN 2500-3500 ft heading into the
afternoon then VFR.

.MARINE...
(Today through Sunday)
Issued at 421 AM PDT Tue Mar 18 2025

A cold front bring renewed chances for rainfall, rough seas and a
strong southerly breeze Wednesday into Thursday.
