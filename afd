.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 109 AM PST Mon Nov 13 2023

A changing weather pattern will bring periods of rain to
the Bay Area this week.

&&

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 1255 AM PST Mon Nov 13 2023

An expansive low pressure system was located over the Gulf of Alaska
early this morning with a belt of 100 kt southwest flow aloft
extending from northwest California into the northern Great Basin.
High clouds extended across the Bay Area and Central Coast in
association with this jet, with patches of fog and low-level stratus
observed via satellite imagery and surface observations.

The aforementioned low is forecast to drop south and locate well
offshore from the California coast later today as the steering flow
largely collapses. This will keep the low pinwheeling about over the
next several days bringing periodic shower chances to the region.
The first rain potential arrives for the Bay Area late tonight as a
perturbation wraps around the eastern periphery of the low. This
will bring a focused push of warm/moist advection through the low
levels with a particular emphasis on the Bay Area and points north.
Shower chances will increase around/after midnight as the best
forcing for ascent arrives, and they should continue into Tuesday
morning before the better lift begins waning. The greatest rain
totals (through early Tuesday morning) are expected across the
North Bay with lower elevations averaging 0.25-0.4" with up to 1"
possible in the coastal Sonoma hills. Lesser amounts are expected
for the remainder of the Bay Area and Santa Cruz Mountains with
totals generally averaging 0.25" or less. Amounts are more iffy
towards the Central Coast which will be somewhat removed from the
better moisture and lift. That said, might see a few hundredths
in the lower elevations and perhaps a bit more in the coastal
ranges through early Tuesday morning. It should be noted that
these showers will be scattered so rain amounts won`t be uniform
from place to place. A little instability is also present
overnight with a small (10-15%) potential for an isolated storm
or two over the waters offshore from Sonoma and Marin Counties.
Given cloud cover and rain lows will be relatively mild and in the
upper 40s to mid 50s. Breezy conditions are expected in the hills
and along the coastal interface tonight.

.LONG TERM...
(Tuesday through Sunday)
Issued at 109 AM PST Mon Nov 13 2023

The deepening gale force low pressure system will stall about 500
miles west of the Bay Area Tuesday. This is already a mature
system with an associated occluded front. As it stalls, the Bay
Area will remain the the warm sector all week, receiving a
persistent moisture influx from southerly winds. The majority of
the rain is expected near the cold frontal boundary, and we can`t
say for sure where that will end up. If the front were to
maintain it`s current forward speed, it would arrive along the
coast in 18-24 hours. However, the front won`t maintain it`s
forward speed. As the low pressure system gets cut off from the
upper level steering flow and begins to meander in the lower mid-
latitudes, the cold front will also slow down. The current prog
charts from WPC actually don`t have frontal passage occuring over
our land area at all this week, with the cold front stalling in
the coastal waters. However, it is challenging to forecast systems
with weak steering flow and slow forward progression. Since the
front will bring the most precipitation and we don`t know exactly
where it will end up, the precipitation forecast is more uncertain
than usual for a medium range forecast.

The general trend over the last 24 hours has been for drier
conditions, with the total rainfall amounts being cut roughly in
half since I last wrote this discussion 24 hours ago. This trend is
well supported in all global models and ensembles. Higher resolution
guidance is beginning to pick up the start of the event, and show it
to be mostly confined north of the Golden Gate through Tuesday.
There is also a new theme of a dry period between Tuesday and
Wednesday, and the second round of precipitation may hold off until
mid-day Wednesday. There will likely even be some decent clearing
between the two waves of overcast skies. We are now expecting
weekly totals of 0.5-1.5 inches across the majority of the area,
with 2-3 inches in the coastal mountains and southern facing
foothills. The rain will taper off by Friday. Again, this forecast
carries more uncertainty than normal, and a relatively small
eastward shift in the low could drastically increase these
estimates. On the other hand, they could continue to decrease if
the low shifts farther out to sea.

Despite the decrease in rainfall estimates, there is still some
instability in the forecast. A few thunderstorms can`t be ruled out
from Wednesday to Thursday. There is currently a slight chance along
the coast and over the ocean. Satellite data reveals the front is
producing some isolated thunderstorms at the moment, but those
may start to dissipate as it loses jet support and the associated
upper level divergence.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 338 AM PST Mon Nov 13 2023

Patches of MVFR-IFR clouds were present over portions of the Bay
Area and Monterey Bay early this morning and will likely persist
until a little after sunrise before lifting. Prevailing VFR this
afternoon before a mix of largely MVFR-VFR ceilings return
overnight. Southerly winds are expected today as a low pressure
system approaches with speeds averaging 08-12 kt this afternoon.
Scattered showers will likely impact the terminals late tonight
into Tuesday morning. For now have -SHRA with 6SM in the Bay Area
TAFs, but at least some transient periods of lower visibility are
possible should a heavier shower impact a terminal. TEMPOs for
this possibility may be included with future updates if confidence
in sub-VFR conditions increases. Otherwise showers taper off by
late morning with dry conditions returning into Tuesday afternoon.

Vicinity of SFO...Prevailing VFR is the most likely forecast
outcome. Although can`t rule out small potential (10-15%) for
MVFR ceilings this morning and again later tonight. Dry conditions
look to prevail through early evening with rain showers likely
impacting the terminal late tonight into Tuesday morning. TEMPOs
may be included with future updates if confidence in sub-VFR
conditions in SHRA increases. Dry conditions return Tuesday
afternoon and evening.

SFO Bridge Approach... Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...IFR ceilings this morning should lift to
VFR by 16-18Z. Prevailing VFR thereafter today. VCSH tonight into
Tuesday morning. On-station SHRA impacts are possible, but
confidence is too low for inclusion in the current TAFs. Winds
will be southerly and breezy this afternoon.

.MARINE...
(Tonight through next Friday)
Issued at 1255 AM PST Mon Nov 13 2023

Moderate southern breezes will become fresh to strong across the
outer waters from tonight into Tuesday as a low pressure system
locates offshore. Locally gusty winds are also expected within the
nearshore waters south of Point Sur. Expect deteriorating marine
conditions this week as the low pressure system brings rain and
isolated thunderstorms to the region. Hazardous winds and seas are
possible for small craft operators at times so stay current with
the latest forecast information.
