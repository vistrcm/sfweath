...New AVIATION...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 1215 AM PDT Mon Jul 31 2023

No big weather changes today with seasonal conditions. Slight
cooling trend through Thursday with some warming into next weekend
as a high pressure ridge nudges closer to the area.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 1215 AM PDT Mon Jul 31 2023

Moisture channel imagery early this morning noted high clouds
overspreading the Bay Area with dry southwest flow prevailing across
far NorCal and the Pacific Northwest. A consensus of the
deterministic forecast models suggest low pressure will center along
the British Columbia coast, while expansive mid-upper ridging will
cover the Desert Southwest and southern Great Plains. The entrance
region of an upper jet will keep high clouds around the Bay Area
today but otherwise not looking for any real change to the large-
scale pattern. Area profilers place the marine layer depth at around
1,000 feet, and with upstream troughing some deepening of the layer
is possible. High clouds were making it hard to distinguish the
exact coverage of low-level stratus, but in general downtown SF, the
Marin Headlands, and southern Monterey Bay were socked in with other
patches here and there along the coastline. Expect coverage to
expand into the morning hours, before a gradual clearing towards the
coast takes place by early afternoon. Patchy fog is also possible,
especially for the coastal hills. High temperatures today should be
near, to perhaps a few degrees cooler than, yesterday. Readings in
the 60s and 70s are expected for the coast and bays, with 80s to
near 90 for the warmest inland areas. Winds will be onshore and
breezy. Humidity will be decent for the lower elevations, with
modest to poor overnight recoveries in the higher terrain. Lows
tonight will dip into the 50s for most of the area with a few higher
elevation spots staying in the lower 60s.

.LONG TERM...
(Tuesday through Sunday)
Issued at 1215 AM PDT Mon Jul 31 2023

Look for a slight cooling trend through Thursday as the Pacific
trough promotes steady onshore flow and a deepening marine layer. A
warming trend develops thereafter as the upper ridge flexes back
towards our area. This will bring some compression of the marine
layer with less stratus/fog outside of the immediate coastal areas.
By next weekend the upper high pressure area expands towards
northern Baja and SoCal, but there`s some question as to what extent
it reaches us. Ensembles and clusters are ultimately mixed on the
final outcome. So while some warming is possible, not yet seeing any
strong signal for extreme heat at this point. So all-in-all a
generally quiet weather forecast should continue into the
foreseeable future.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 430 AM PDT Mon Jul 31 2023

A mix of VFR, IFR and LIFR conditions across the region with
IFR/LIFR conditions near Monterey Bay terminals, inland and SF bay
terminals experiencing VFR and North Bay terminals IFR. Satellite
imagery makes it difficult to estimate clearing time as high
clouds dominate the image. Marine layer remains ~1000 feet,
therefore chances are possible for KOAK to experience IFR
conditions this morning but low confidence. All terminals will
experience stratus dissipation near 16-19Z. Expect stratus to
return tonight with a possibility of higher ceilings in comparison
to the last few nights with low CIGs. Onshore winds increase near
the afternoon with a return of light/moderate winds tonight.

Vicinity of SFO...Currently VFR, with a possibility that the
terminal may experience MVFR/IFR ceilings within the early morning
hours but low confidence to include in TAFs. Expect breezy and gusty
onshore winds this afternoon, with winds returning to moderate
tonight. Chances are possible for MVFR ceilings early tomorrow
morning but moderate confidence, therefore TEMPO was placed.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...LIFR as stratus prevails over both
terminals with chances that visibility and ceilings may lower in
the early morning hours. Expect lifting and dissipation of
stratus near 17-19Z. Winds are expected to become breezy in the
Salinas valley creating 14kts winds near KSTS in the afternoon.
Otherwise, expect onshore winds to remain light/moderate for both
terminals.


&&

.MARINE...
(Tonight through next Friday)
Issued at 1017 PM PDT Sun Jul 30 2023

Surface high pressure over the offshore waters will result in
gusty northwesterly winds across the coastal waters through the
week. The San Francisco Bay to the Delta and the Monterey Bay will
see gusty winds developing each afternoon and evening, then
diminishing winds overnight. In addition to short period wind
waves, light southerly swell continues to move through the waters
through the forecast period.
