...New UPDATE, MARINE...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 323 AM PDT Fri May 2 2025

Cloudy this morning, with the potential for light drizzle along
the coast and in the higher terrain. A front moves through today,
which will mix out stratus, bring high clouds and increasing NW
winds. Breezy northwest (onshore) winds are expected late Sat
morning through early Sun morning, with offshore winds expected
late Sun into Mon.

&&

.UPDATE...
Issued at 905 AM PDT Fri May 2 2025

The 12Z sounding found very dry air above the marine layer. At one
point Mt. St. Helena was reporting the RH as low as 3%. If you
were to go on an early morning hike you could park your wet car
at a foggy trial head and literally walk into air drier than the
Sahara Desert in a couple hours. This dry air is helping to erode
the stratus from above in some areas, but the clearing is far from
uniform. Our focus today is on strong winds along the coast this
weekend, and we plan to issue a wind advisory on this shift with
all the details.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 323 AM PDT Fri May 2 2025

Key Messages

-Cloudy this morning, with patchy drizzle along the coast and
perhaps in higher terrain.
-Onshore winds increase late today and continue into weekend

Upper level ridging gives way to an upper level trough today. At the
surface, a cold front associated advances eastwards with the trough
making its way over northern CA this evening. The marine layer and
associated stratus should hold through mid morning, with patchy
drizzle along the coast and in the higher terrain. Stratus will then
begin to mix out for the majority of the area by the late morning
hours. Then, with the approaching trough and cold front, high clouds
will begin to filter in while winds begin increasing by the evening
hours.

.LONG TERM...
(Saturday through Thursday)
Issued at 323 AM PDT Fri May 2 2025

Key Messages

- Gusty NW winds peaking Saturday afternoon/evening
- Inland gusts 35-45 mph
- Coastal gusts 45-50 mph
- Very little rainfall Saturday AM
- Elevated fire danger interior North Bay/East Bay Monday AM  (dry,
offshore wind)

The key message from yesterday remain on point, thus no changes
there. The cold front should be exiting our forecast area by
Saturday morning. PoP/rain chances were obliterated by the NBM with
this update, though some of the models still show the potential for
light drizzle or perhaps even light rain (a couple hundredths of an
inch or so) with the passage of the front. The main story with this
system will be the increasing onshore (NW) winds on Saturday.
Ensemble guidance, via the NAEFS and ECENS, and deterministic models
are in agreement with gusty NW winds ramping up late Saturday
morning, peaking during the afternoon and evening hours, and then
winding down by Sunday morning. Guidance has the jet setting up
right along our coast, which will support the stronger winds of 45-
50 mph, though if the guidance shows the slightly higher trends it
could be isolated up to 55 mph. These winds should also be noted for
gaps that are orientated from NW to SE (e.g. San Bruno Gap and the
Salinas Valley). Elsewhere, inland gusts should range from 35-45 mph.
The highest confidence for Saturday`s winds are along the coast.
However, given the signal for the potentially stronger winds, I
opted to not pull the trigger on a Wind Advisory since there was
some flirting with High Wind Criteria for these areas. Confidence is
lower for the inland valleys for a Wind Advisory, as winds may not
be as widespread.

As we head into Sunday, upper low digs all the way into southern CA
with some models showing a closed low forming and advancing into the
Desert Southwest. Broad troughing still reigns over much of the West
Coast, with upper level ridging building over the eastern Pacific.
Models show a second upper level disturbance embedded in this flow,
which should bring us some offshore winds late Sunday into Monday
for the North Bay and East Bay mountains. Conditions will be drier,
but shouldn`t coincide with the peak winds at this time though some
drying is to be expected from this event. After that, upper level
ridging looks to hold through midweek.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 425 AM PDT Fri May 2 2025

Extensive IFR-MVFR stratus across the region with scattered LIFR in
favored locations in the coastal regions. Stratus mixes out later
this morning, with breezy and gusty west winds developing this
afternoon. An approaching cold front should lift and erode the
marine layer inversion through the day, thus while extensive stratus
is again forecast tonight for the Bay Area and Monterey Bay regions,
ceilings should be higher, with moderate confidence in generally
MVFR ceilings. Beyond the 24-hour TAF period, the cold front will
bring strong gusty winds and scattered light showers to the region
on Saturday afternoon and evening.

Vicinity of SFO... Low-end MVFR to IFR ceilings through the late
morning. West winds gusting to around 25 kt will develop this
afternoon, with winds remaining breezy through the night into
Saturday as the cold front promotes a strengthening pressure
gradient. MVFR stratus is expected tonight, dissipating Saturday
morning as winds increase through and beyond the end of the TAF
period with gusts 35 kt or above possible Saturday afternoon.

SFO Bridge Approach... Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals... MVFR-IFR through the late morning-early
afternoon hours. Breezy northwest winds develop this afternoon,
continuing into the night especially at SNS. MVFR ceilings return
in the early evening hours through the end of the TAF period.

.MARINE...
(Today through Wednesday)
Issued at 905 AM PDT Fri May 2 2025

An approaching cold front will cause NNW winds to gradually
increase to gale force by Saturday evening. These winds will
persist through Sunday, building very rough seas.
