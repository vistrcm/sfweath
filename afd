.SHORT TERM...
Issued at 226 AM PST Thu Nov 6 2025
(Today and tonight)

Compared to yesterday, conditions are much more tranquil as our
potent upper system continues to move into the northern High
Plains. However, westerly moist flow within the 700-500mb layer
along with modest 925-850mb warm air advection will at a minimum
re-inforce cloud cover, particularly for the Bay Area and points
northward. Low level ascent is most prominent across the North Bay
and as a result, I`ve opted to make some slight alterations to
increase the areal coverage of 20-40% PoPs and latest radar
imagery supports this. The thick low/mid level clouds may hinder
widespread dense fog development here, and I`ve opted for
"patchy" fog wording here. Farther south, low level flow is a
little more southerly which may not encourage as much ascent and
this minimizes the chance for rain showers and low clouds (except
along the immediate coast). With the relatively clearer conditions
in tandem with recent rainfall, the potential for a greater
coverage of radiation fog, some dense, will reside across the
South Bay and parts of the Central Coast. We`ll monitor trends for
any potential dense fog products.

With the zonal flow aloft, it`s unlikely that our next front will
make much southward progress during the day today. Persistent
westerly warm/moist flow in tandem with orographic ascent ahead of
this feature will continue to support the development of rain
showers across the North Bay. Rain amounts are anticipated to
average around 0.10", mainly across the northern Sonoma Coastal
Ranges. While meaningful PoPs are advertised as far south as Santa
Rosa, the probability of exceeding 0.10" here is around 5%.

Later this evening and tonight, a mid-level jet max characterized
by 100 knot flow will swing through central Oregon. As surface
cyclogenesis ensues, this should help drag the aforementioned
frontal boundary southward. Eventually, this feature will undergo
frontolysis as the parent surface low lifts eastward.

.LONG TERM...
Issued at 226 AM PST Thu Nov 6 2025
(Friday through Wednesday)

Before our next front completely loses steam, it still appears
that it`ll interact with a moist airmass and kick off some showers
across the North Bay through pre-dawn hours on Friday. Measurable
rainfall does seem plausible even south of the Golden Gate. PoPs
range from near 70% along the Sonoma/Mendocino County line to 15%
just south of Half Moon Bay Friday morning. Some of the newer NBM
probabilities do suggest that low PoPs may be needed as far south
as the Santa Cruz mountains, but for now, confidence isn`t high
that sufficient ascent will reside that far south. Trends in short
term NWP will be monitored. Rain amounts still appear relatively
lighter compared to the last day or so with values largely under
1/4 of an inch.

Little to no potential for rain is forecast for the entire area
starting Friday afternoon and into the weekend. Ridging is
anticipated to build in across the eastern Pacific which turns our
mid/upper level flow more northwest and northerly. Offshore flow
at least within the 500-925mb layer should at scour out low level
moisture. This will translate to warmer and more pleasant
conditions outdoors with highs ranging between the mid 60s to mid
80s. If headed to the beach, beware that long period westerly
swell will increase the risk for rip currents and sneaker waves.
We`ve highlighted this threat with a Beach Hazard Statement. For
more details, see the "beaches" section of the AFD.

Model guidance seems to be coming into slightly better agreement
with a fair to foul weather transition next week. About 1/4 of GFS
and ECMWF ensemble members advertise that the H5 ridge will start
to breakdown and troughing will return to the west coast by
Monday evening, with a majority of the multi-model ensemble
advertising that this will not occur until about 24-48 hours
later. For now, will ride with the blend for PoPs in the extended.
These spatial discrepancies equate to a broad-brush and low
confidence rain forecast for Tuesday and Wednesday. Initial
glances at some AR tools would point to more beneficial rainfall,
but as we venture closer, we`ll refine timing, rain amounts, and
impacts.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 252 AM PST Thu Nov 6 2025

Currently a mixed bag of IFR-VFR at the terminals with IFR being
observed at HAF and MVFR being reported at all other terminals with
the exception of SJC which is VFR. APC, MRY, and STS have
observed IFR ceilings this morning, so it is not out of the realm
of possibilities for those to redevelop at the terminals
especially for the North Bay where rain showers continue. Warm and
moist advection will delay improvement to VFR to late-morning at
best. Low-end VFR ceilings will likely linger through the day,
especially for the North Bay. Widespread IFR-MVFR is slated to
return tonight.

Vicinity of SFO...Currently MVFR and calm. An MVFR ceiling will
linger through the morning. Winds will be light and variable this
morning before the afternoon sea breeze kicks in. An MVFR ceiling
returns tonight.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...Currently MVFR with easterly flow at MRY
and MVFR and calm at STS. While dense fog has been reported in the
Central Coast, at this rate with MVFR ceilings in place and mid-
level clouds overhead any expansion of it is not expected. VFR will
prevail by late-morning.

.MARINE...
(Today through Tuesday)
Issued at 252 AM PST Thu Nov 6 2025

Very rough seas are expected for the inner waters and outer waters
today as long period westerly swell builds in. Seas slowly begin
to abate to become rough tomorrow and moderate by Sunday. A gentle
to moderate northerly breeze will prevail.

.BEACHES...
Issued at 226 AM PST Thu Nov 6 2025

Hazardous beach conditions will persist through Saturday for all
Pacific Coast beaches. Today`s conditions will be on the cusp of
Beach Hazards Statement/High Surf Advisory with an increased risk of
sneaker waves and rip currents as well as breaking waves up to 25
feet. Remain out of the water to avoid hazardous swimming
conditions, stay off of jetties, piers, and other waterside
infrastructure, and never turn your back on the ocean! The
increased risk for sneaker waves and rip currents will linger
Friday through early Saturday morning with westerly swell quickly
rebuilding.
