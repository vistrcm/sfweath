...New AVIATION...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 133 AM PDT Mon Jul 17 2023

Somewhat cooler temperatures are expected through mid week. A high
pressure ridge should build into the region towards next weekend
with a late week warming trend.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 133 AM PDT Mon Jul 17 2023

The large-scale picture early this morning features expansive upper
ridging centered over the Desert Southwest and upper troughing
across the northeast Pacific. A weak perturbation was evident on
moisture channel imagery lifting around the ridge periphery over
NorCal and northwest Nevada. This impulse was responsible for
isolated thunderstorms last evening over portions of Sonoma and Napa
Counties. With the upper ridge and upper level disturbance pulling
away, this will put an end to our excessive heat and thunderstorm
chances. So it`s looking a little quieter in the weather department.
The upper level impulse has disrupted the typical stratus pattern,
with a mix of mid level clouds and clear skies blanketing the
region. Low stratus should return to the Monterey Bay region later
this morning but should be much less present across the Bay Area.
Any stratus should mix out during the mid to late morning hours.
Temperatures today will be warm for inland areas. And while we`re
not expecting excessive heat heat safety measures should still be
practiced. Highs inland will range from the upper 80s to upper
90s, with the typical hot spots rising to around, or just above,
the century mark. Meanwhile the marine layer influence will
prevail around the coast and bays with highs largely in the 60s
and 70s. Lows tonight should be closer to the seasonal normals
with low elevation readings in the 50s and a mix of 50s to lower
70s for the hills.

PREVIOUS DISCUSSION
Issued at 136 PM PDT Sun Jul 16 2023

Further cooling is expect Tuesday and Wednesday with weaker zonal
flow aloft over NorCal. Coastal areas will remain in the 60s and
70s with interior areas reaching the 80s to mid 90s. Zonal flow
weakens late week and high pressure to the SE begins to build over
CA once again. Temperatures will trend upward Thursday through
Saturday. Heat risk concerns will return across the interior with
highs in the 90s to lower 100s. Onshore flow will keep
temperatures cool along the coast once again.
