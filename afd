...New AVIATION...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 400 AM PDT Sun Jul 2 2023

The Heat Advisory remains in effect for inland areas until 11 pm
tonight. The center of a high pressure system is over interior
California and will continue to advance steadily eastward through
early to mid week. This system will again result in hot temperatures
across inland areas with daytime highs reaching the 90s to lower
100s today. Current forecast high temperatures today inland where
it will be hottest again are not expected to reach records; today`s
records are below in the discussion for reference. The marine layer
otherwise remains compressed limiting cooling influences to the
immediate coast again today. Cooler maritime onshore breezes will
usher in a gradual cooling trend early to mid this week.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 430 AM PDT Sun Jul 2 2023

The center of a 500 mb height (593 decameters) high pressure
system is over interior California and slowly moving eastward. Air
temperatures in the hills and mountains are in the 70s/80s at
this early morning hour, well within the compressed lower level
temperature inversion under the western portion of the high
pressure system. Similar to Saturday morning it`s much cooler with
50s near and at sea level within the shallow marine layer. The
marine layer is holding together with fog and stratus seen on
satellite imagery along the north Central Coast, visibilities in
fog lowering to 1/2 to 1/4 mile, with occasionally less than 1/4
mile in dense fog. There is a 2.9 mb SMX-SFO pressure gradient
(southerly wind potential) that`s under-forecast by NAM and HRRR
output; not much wind from the south along the coast though this
magnitude of a gradient should help nudge forward at least a light
southerly wind flow, directing the fog and stratus northward along
the coast through morning. The (2 mb) ACV-SFO gradient (1.5) mb
SFO-SAC gradient more recently approximately equivalent and both
are weaker than the SMX-SFO gradient. On the larger scale there
is a weakness in thermal ridging in the high pressure system at
700 mb over our cwa that`ll help ease the strength of the high
over our cwa while combining surface pressure gradients bring
increasingly onshore breezes along with steady cooling beginning
especially from early Monday morning onward, especially late each
day and night, through the week.

.LONG TERM...
(Monday through Saturday)
Issued at 430 AM PDT Sun Jul 2 2023

Steady cooling is forecast, including inland locations feeling
fresher sea breezes through the week. Heat risks lowering through
the week, varying from little to no risk at the coast and bays to
minor risk inland. Marine layer stratus and fog increasingly
advancing inland each night and morning, patchy late night and
morning light coastal drizzle possibly returning as well.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 443 AM PDT Sun Jul 2 2023

VFR conditions for most terminals north of Monterey Bay continues to
prevail as the high pressure system brought some warmer temperatures
over our region, which helped mixed out any stratus over most
terminals. The marine layer continues to remain pretty compressed.
As the system moves out of our area and cooler temperatures return,
expect some stratus to build after midnight tonight but uncertain if
those ceilings may lower to anything outside of VFR criteria, with
the exception of Monterey Bay. Higher confidence that KSTS may
experience some MVFR ceilings after midnight/Monday morning with
20% chance of patchy fog. Generally, winds will encompass a N/NW
component and speeds are expected to increase in the afternoon
with a transition back to light/moderate winds tonight.

Vicinity of SFO...VFR with high confidence that those conditions
will prevail throughout today with chances of stratus returning
Monday morning. Models suggest those ceilings will fit MVFR ceilings
but had low confidence to include in TAFs. N/NW winds are expected
to increase to breezy winds up to 18 knots, then tapering off near
the evening/night.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...Mostly LIFR with moments of VFR for both
terminals. High confidence clearing will occur near 16-17Z. Expect
stratus to return with a mix of MVFR, IFR and LIFR CIGs late
tonight. Uncertainty on the timing of the stratus returning and
exact ceiling height, as models lack agreement. Therefore, will
continue to monitor.

.MARINE...
(Tonight through next Thursday)
Issued at 854 PM PDT Sat Jul 1 2023

Gusty northwesterly winds over the northern outer waters will
diminish through the night, where associated locally steep wind
waves will create hazardous conditions for small craft. Otherwise,
winds will generally remain more modest until the end of the week.
Mixed seas will prevail, with a longer period southerly swell and
a moderate period northwesterly swell, through the middle of next
week.

&&

.FIRE WEATHER...
(Today through Tuesday)
Issued at 410 AM PDT Sun Jul 2 2023

Hot and dry conditions inland will increase fire danger and
ignition probabilities as daytime temperatures reach the 90s.
Meanwhile, the marine layer will remain compressed to less than
1000 feet through today resulting in little to no overnight
humidity recovery in the hills. Hot afternoon temperatures will be
followed by mild to warm nights in the higher terrain. Overall,
expect hot temperatures and light winds, especially inland with
light onshore breezes near the coast and in the coastal valleys.
As a result, ERC values will climb sharply this weekend, likely
above the 90th percentile in the hills with muted growth for lower
elevations that will still see better humidity recovery each
night. Despite the cool down early this week, more modest humidity
recoveries lag behind in the far interior and in the higher
terrain. Any nighttime ignitions in the hills this weekend will
not get typical humidity recover to help with suppression.

.BEACHES...
Issued at 103 PM PDT Thu Jun 29 2023

With the upcoming heat for the weekend before Independence Day, a
lot of people are expected to seek relief at the beaches. There
are two main risks to beachgoers. The first risk is that water
temperatures remain cold in the 50s. Unprepared beachgoers may
suffer cold weather shock if they are not used to being in the
ocean. As a side note, travelers to mountain streams should be
aware that due to continuing snowmelt, the streams are colder than
usual, increasing the risk of cold weather shock. The second risk
for beachgoers is the threat for rip currents. While the rip
current risk is not higher than usual this weekend, it`s still
important for folks to watch out for each other as beaches may be
more crowded than normal.

Never turn your back to the ocean! It is safest to swim at a beach
with lifeguards. If you are caught in a rip current, don`t try to
swim against it. Instead, swim out of the current, parallel to the
shore, and then back to shore. If you can`t swim, float or tread
water, and yell or wave for help if you need assistance.
