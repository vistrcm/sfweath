.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 256 AM PDT Sat Mar 29 2025

Dry conditions with below seasonal average temperatures today. Several
rounds of rainfall are expected to impact the region between
tonight and mid-to-late next week.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 256 AM PDT Sat Mar 29 2025

Shortwave ridging will be the name of the game today with below
normal temperatures and light diurnal winds being the byproduct.
Expect an increase in cloud cover throughout the day as the cloud
shield from a developing gale force low pressure system in the
Eastern Pacific Ocean encroaches the Northern California Coast.

.LONG TERM...
(Sunday through Friday)
Issued at 256 AM PDT Sat Mar 29 2025

Warm frontal rain processes will begin this evening over the marine
zones and spread east through the night with everywhere expected to
receive measurable precipitation. Rainfall coverage and intensity
will begin diminishing by Sunday afternoon before cold frontal
processes commence by Sunday night. Collectively, this system will
bring widespread rainfall to the region with a northwest to
southeast gradient with the greatest accumulation expected in the
coastal ranges. Gusty conditions can also be expected with
widespread wind gusts of 20 mph, up to 45 mph to be expected along
the immediate coast, in the higher terrain, and through gaps and
passes. The primary impact remains to be wet roadways.

Our CWA is roughly between 36 (border of Monterey and San Luis
Obispo Counties) and 39 (border of Sonoma and Mendocino Counties)
degrees North. Why am I bringing this up? Well, if you are a
frequent reader you would know that we have been advertising the
potential for an atmospheric river for the last 9 days and that
there has been and continues to be a great deal of uncertainty in
terms of rainfall and thus impacts which is quite unusual within 72
hours of an event. So why is there still uncertainty? To be more
specific about the uncertainty we are seeing, it increases the
further south (lower in latitude) you go along the coast. According
to the ECMWF EPS and GEFS 80 member ensemble mean, 39 degrees North
is never expected to breach the 250 kg/ms integrated water vapor
transport threshold needed to be deemed an atmospheric river
while 36 degrees North briefly breaches the necessary threshold.
Both the ECMWF and GEFS ensemble means maintain the not an
atmospheric river posture at 39 degrees North. Ensemble means
diverge at 36 degrees North when GEFS shows a weak atmospheric
river and ECMWF shows no atmospheric river. Here`s where it gets
crazy. Up at 39 degrees North, the 80 member ensemble +1 standard
deviation shows brief time periods of a weak atmospheric river
while the -1 standard deviation shows brief time periods of 0
kg/ms. The results are similar, but a little more dramatic at 36
degrees North. There are two GEFS maxima that advertise a strong
atmospheric river at 39 degrees North, that number increases to
eight at 36 degrees North. While that still holds true, the
deterministic GFS (which has been the outlier by being
exceptionally wetter than the deterministic ECMWF) is trending
drier. All of this to say that the official forecasted rainfall
totals have trended down with a northwest to southeast gradient of
1.50 inches to 0.05 inches expected in the North Bay Mountains to
Interior Central Coast respectively with coastal ranges expected
to squeeze out the most precipitation.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 434 AM PDT Sat Mar 29 2025

VFR conditions will persist through the majority of the day. A
short wave ridge will bring mostly clear skies this morning
before an approaching warm front increases high cloud cover in
the afternoon and brings some light rain by Sunday morning. NW
winds will shift to a moderate southerly breeze overnight as the
front approaches.

Vicinity of SFO...While there are some scattered low clouds around
the bay, there is high confidence that VFR conditions will persist
through the majority of the day. As the front approaches,
southerly winds will increase, with OAK being more exposed than
SFO. Light rain should begin early Sunday morning, with ceilings
gradually lowering to MVFR by mid morning.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...Outside of some quickly passing low
clouds, VFR conditions and mostly clear skies will dominate the
morning. Ceilings and rain will move in Sunday morning, but the
southerly winds won`t be as strong compared to the terminals
further north, which are closer to the low pressure center.

.MARINE...
(Today through Thursday)
Issued at 434 AM PDT Sat Mar 29 2025

High swell continues to diminish through the day with moderate
seas expected through the weekend. An approaching warm front will
bring a strong southerly breeze Sunday morning. Rough to very
rough seas return Tuesday as a low pressure system brings a strong
NW breeze to the coastal waters through mid week.
