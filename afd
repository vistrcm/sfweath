...New AVIATION...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 241 AM PDT Sun May 25 2025

Near normal temperatures to start the work week. Warming trend on
tap through the week with above normal temps anticipated by the
weekend.

&&

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 241 AM PDT Sun May 25 2025

Fairly quiet pattern continues to round out the weekend with
seasonal temperatures and breezy afternoon winds. This evening, a
weak upper trough is progged to move through the region, reinforcing
the NW onshore flow pattern and slightly deepening the marine layer.
Locations that start the day under marine stratus will likely have
at least some degree of clear skies this afternoon before becoming
overcast again early this evening. Increasing cloud cover also
spreads inland as this weak wave moves through overnight, enhancing
mid-level moisture advection during the overnight hours.

.LONG TERM...
(Monday through Saturday)
Issued at 241 AM PDT Sun May 25 2025

High confidence in a highly amplified ridge pattern over the western
US by late this week and upcoming weekend. This will promote a
warming trend this week and daytime high temperatures 10-15 degrees
above normal by the weekend. The silver lining for areas along the
coast is that the marine layer looks to stay intact through the
warming event, so coastal areas may stay near seasonal normal highs
through the period. For interior locations and South Bay urban
areas, there is a risk of heat-related illness for those who are
sensitive to heat and those without adequate hydration or cooling
Friday and Saturday. There does still exist some chance of a cut-
off low affecting the weather in our region this weekend, but
concern is lessening for any adverse impacts.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 423 AM PDT Sun May 25 2025

Interesting marine layer on satellite fog product early this
morning - rather broken up and not continuous. That being said,
seeing a mix of MVFR to IFR conditions impacting Bay Area
terminals. Expecting gradual clearing through 17-19Z depending
upon the terminal. KHAF will struggle to clear at all today.
Monterey Bay will also struggle to clear, but am forecast a few
hours of VFR. Cigs return most areas again tonight, but less than
30% conf for N Bay and SJC cigs. In addition to CIGS stronger
onshore winds will pick up this afternoon. Winds eventually ease
tonight.

Vicinity of SFO...MVFR cigs through 18Z and possible lingering
(less than 20%) through 19Z. Stronger onshore kicks in this
afternoon, but maxed out gusts to 30kt. Less than 15% for actually
reaching AWW criteria. Despite stronger winds crosswind impacts
will be minimal.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO mostly. Far S end of SF Bay
will see less cloud impacts, but approach still has cigs.

Monterey Bay Terminals...MVFR cigs well into the afternoon. There
is a small eddy in the bay that may allow for brief clearing early
this morning, but cigs should fill back into. Cigs again tonight.

.MARINE...
(Today through Friday)
Issued at 241 AM PDT Sun May 25 2025

Northerly winds ease briefly Sunday morning as a cold front
approaches from the north. Winds will be locally stronger along
the immediate coastal areas thanks to a coastal jet. Additionally,
stronger winds will be possible inside San Francisco Bay Sunday
afternoon and evening. Behind the front, northerly winds increase
Monday afternoon and evening. Expect hazardous marine conditions
to continue into early next week as rough and hazardous seas
linger.

     for SF Bay N of Bay Bridge.
