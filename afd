.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 130 AM PST Wed Dec 20 2023

Central Coast. Dry conditions return by late week and persist into
the start of the holiday week.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 130 AM PST Wed Dec 20 2023

An mid/upper level low pressure system is position approximately 350
miles west of San Francisco early this morning. As such, light-to-
moderate rain is moving into the North Bay with scattered showers
along the coastal ranges. As the day progresses, expect rain to move
inland across the entire region with the coastal ranges picking up
the most rainfall of 1.50-3.00" and lower elevations seeing 0.50-
1.50". Instability looks to increase though the day with the
potential for isolated thunderstorms (15-25%) with a focus over the
Central Coast. Any thunderstorms that do develop will have the
potential to produce locally heavy rainfall.

A Wind Advisory has been posted for the Santa Lucia Mountains and
Los Padres National Forest from 4 AM - 7 PM PST Wednesday. Wind
gusts are likely to exceed 45 mph during this timeframe. A Coastal
Flood Advisory is also in effect for the areas adjacent to the San
Francisco Bay from 3 AM - 7 AM PST Wednesday for minor coastal
flooding.

Rain will tapper off from north to south as we head into tonight as
the mid/upper level low slides southward down the coast. Instability
also shifts southward and becomes focused over LOX`s area.

.LONG TERM...
(Thursday through Tuesday)
Issued at 130 AM PST Wed Dec 20 2023

Lingering precipitation is likely across the Central Coast into
Thursday morning and potentially the afternoon as the low pressure
wobbles off of the southern California coast. Drier conditions
develop over the Bay Area by Thursday morning.

A mainly dry cold front will push through Friday night with
temperatures cooling down into the 50s for high temperatures by
Saturday. This sets the stage for colder nights with lows in the
lower 30s across the interior and 40s near the the coast by Saturday
and Sunday mornings (potentially beyond). Will need to monitor for
frost/freeze products. Next chance of rain returns by the middle of
next week.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 341 AM PST Wed Dec 20 2023

Showers have returned to the North and SF Bay causing a mix of
VFR and MVFR conditions. The remaining terminals continue to
prevail VFR until the rain band approaches the terminals later
this morning, which may cause vis and cigs to drop to MVFR. KSTS
may experience IFR conditions as the rain becomes heavier over the
terminal from 12- 14Z. As the rain diminishes this evening,
expect a return of VFR for all terminals. Models hint at MVFR
ceilings returning for most terminals early Thursday morning. With
low confidence to include in TAFs as a OVC or BKN, a SCT group
was included to suggest there is a possibility of lower clouds.
Winds will remain offshore through the TAF period but will
diminish towards the evening into the night.

Vicinity of SFO...Ceilings have been alternating between VFR and
MVFR as showers move over the terminal. Therefore, expect a mix of
VFR and MVFR through most of the morning with a chance of IFR from
13-15Z as the stronger part of the rain band moves over the
terminal. Conditions will start to improve towards the late
afternoon. Winds are expected to remain S/SE but will start to
diminish this evening. Chances of MVFR ceilings return for Thursday
morning but low confidence at this moment, will monitor models for
any updated changes to the future TAF packages.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...VFR prevails with anticipation of that
showers will start to approach the terminal near 13-14Z this
morning. This will cause ceilings and vis to lower to MVFR until
this evening where VFR will returns as the showers diminish and the
low pressure system moves southward. Breezy S/SE winds will become
light at KSNS late this afternoon as the drainage flow diminishes.

&&

.MARINE...
(Today through Monday)
Issued at 341 AM PST Wed Dec 20 2023

A north-south oriented line of rain is moving through the coastal
waters. So far no lightning has been observed, but the slight
chance for thunderstorms will continue through the afternoon with
the best chance south of Pigeon Point. Southerly winds are
diminishing across the northern waters, but south of Point Pinos
southerly winds will become strong with gale force gusts this
morning. Winds will diminish through the afternoon. Seas will
become elevated at around 9 to 12 feet today as are expected
again as a moderate period northwest swell propagates through the
waters. Dry weather and northerly winds return by the end of the
week, with gusty and gale force winds possible Friday night.
