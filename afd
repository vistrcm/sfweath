...New AVIATION, MARINE...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 155 AM PDT Tue Oct 24 2023

Near normal temperatures Tuesday before a parade of cold fronts
brings colder weather starting Wednesday. There`s a chance of light
rain with one of these fronts on Friday. Moderate to fresh offshore
winds are possible through the San Francisco Bay Delta on Sunday.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 155 AM PDT Tue Oct 24 2023

A dense fog advisory is in effect for the North Bay Interior
Valleys. This was issued just after midnight with calm to light
winds, clear skies, and high humidity signaling the current area of
fog in the northern Napa Valley and western foothills will grow
through the early morning hours. Model guidance suggests that the
Napa Valley will be more impacted than the Santa Rosa Plain, but
climatology tells us the opposite. The fog should quickly clear
between the hours of 9-10 AM.

Otherwise Tuesday will be a pretty standard day with near normal
temperatures, no precipitation, gentle to moderate NW wind, and a
shallow marine layer supporting morning clouds over the usual
coastal areas and the Salinas Valley.

.LONG TERM...
(Wednesday through Monday)
Issued at 155 AM PDT Tue Oct 24 2023

A mid-level low pressure system over British Colombia is dropping
south towards Northern California today. This system will support a
cold front across the Bay Area late Wednesday into early Thursday.
There is a slight chance of precipitation with this front, but the
biggest impact will be colder temperatures. 1000-500 mb thickness
looks to drop to to the 550-560 dm range across the Bay Area.
Morning low temperatures on Thursday may challenge some daily
records, and there is a very slight chance of frost at higher
elevations in the North and East Bay. Most areas will be in the
upper 30s to upper 40s in the morning, and struggle to get out of
the mid 60s during the day. Temperatures will remain cool through
the weekend.

The best chance of rain is from another cold front on Friday.
There`s still a lot of uncertainty regarding the amount. This
time yesterday, the expected accumulation was about 5 times as
much as the current forecast. Best guess for now is between a few
hundredths and 1/10", with locally higher amounts in the coastal
mountains.

The third noteworthy event is moderate to fresh offshore winds
across the North Bay and the Bay-Delta region on Sunday. This event
could lower dew points into the mid 20s and bring clear skies to the
Bay Area Sun-Mon. Another consideration is fire weather concerns.
Two ingredients are in place (wind and humidity) but cooler
temperatures and recent rain should help avoid any critical fire
weather threat. We will start running the Red Flag Warning checklist
each shift, just to be sure.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 422 AM PDT Tue Oct 24 2023

It`s a mixed bag of flight categories this morning, with the Bay
Area terminals ranging from VFR to LIFR with IFR around Monterey
Bay. Currently sub-VFR at KOAK and the North Bay terminals, and
expect these conditions to prevail through the mid to late morning
hours. Less confidence at KSFO. While they`ve remained clear so
far, satellite imagery appears to suggest low clouds filling in
around the approach this morning. Things are more clear cut around
Monterey Bay where IFR conditions should prevail through mid to
late morning. Clearing to VFR is expected at all terminals by
18-19Z at latest.

Vicinity of SFO...Initially VFR but low clouds are filling in
around the terminal. Added TEMPO for MVFR ceilings but there is a
20 percent probability for at least transient IFR ceilings as
well. Regardless low clouds look to be a problem in the approach
through at least mid morning. VFR thereafter with breezy onshore
winds developing around 20-21Z.

SFO Bridge Approach...Low stratus clouds are filling in around the
approach and should remain problematic through the mid to late
morning. Otherwise similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...IFR ceilings have settled in and should
persist through the late morning hours. Pockets of BR/FG will
remain in the vicinity as well, but low confidence in on-station
impacts. Clearing to VFR by mid morning at KSNS, but ceilings
could linger a bit longer at KMRY. Light onshore winds return this
afternoon.

.MARINE...
(Today through Sunday)
Issued at 422 AM PDT Tue Oct 24 2023

Fresh to strong northwest breezes will continue for the local
waters into tonight. Gale-force gusts are expected for the
northern outer waters. Gusty winds return for mid to late week as
a cold front moves through the local waters. This will bring a
continuation of hazardous conditions for small craft operators.

&&

.MTR WATCHES/WARNINGS/ADVISORIES...
CA...Dense Fog Advisory until 10 AM PDT this morning for CAZ506.

PZ...Small Craft Advisory until 9 AM PDT this morning for PZZ540.

     Small Craft Advisory from 3 PM this afternoon to 9 AM PDT
     Wednesday for PZZ540-545.

     Small Craft Advisory from 9 PM this evening to 3 AM PDT
     Wednesday for PZZ565.

     Gale Warning until 9 AM PDT this morning for PZZ570.

     Small Craft Advisory until 9 AM PDT Wednesday for PZZ575.
