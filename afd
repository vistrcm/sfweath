.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 100 AM PDT Thu Jul 13 2023

Strong high pressure will bring rising temperatures for late week
into this weekend. The greatest potential for excessive heat will
arrive on Saturday into Sunday, with high temperatures in the 90s
to around 110. Overnight cooling will be limited, with a moderate
to high HeatRisk for the general population. Gradual cooling will
take place through early next week.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 100 AM PDT Thu Jul 13 2023

Moisture channel imagery reveals a dirty high pressure ridge
locating from SoCal through the Southern Plains, with convection
scattered about from northern Mexico into southern New Mexico.
Meanwhile zonal flow prevailed upstream from the eastern Pacific
through the Pacific Northwest and northern/central CA. Subtropical
surface high pressure was holding court across the eastern Pacific.
A consensus of the deterministic models and their ensembles suggest
little in the way of large-scale changes for today, with a slight
increase in mid-level geopotential heights as the upper ridge nudges
ever so slightly towards us. This will increasingly compress the
marine layer leaving stratus and fog (some locally dense) confined
to the immediate coast and bays, with a more rapid mix-out taking
place by tomorrow morning. Skies should be mostly sunny by the
afternoon hours outside of a few of the more typically vulnerable
spots for marine-influenced cloud coverage. Temperatures will start
to warm, with readings ranging from the upper 60s to lower 70s along
the coast and within the coastal-influenced valleys, to the 80s and
90s for the typically warmer inland locations. A few areas in
southern Monterey/San Benito Counties and bordering the Sacramento
Valley may approach the century mark. Look for a compressed marine
layer yet again overnight with stratus/fog confined to the immediate
coast and bays. Lows will dip into the 50s for most areas, with 60s
to around 70 in higher elevations. This will produce a low to
moderate HeatRisk suggesting some risk for those who are sensitive
to heat, especially those without adequate cooling or hydration.

.LONG TERM...
(Friday through Wednesday)
Issued at 100 AM PDT Thu Jul 13 2023

The center of a strong (596 dm) high pressure center aloft will
locate near, or just east of, Central California. This will be
coupled with warm low-level thermal advection and 850 mb
temperatures rising into the 28-30 deg C range on Saturday into
Sunday. These values, if realized, would exceed the daily maximum
values at KOAK based on a perusal of archived sounding data. Given
dry and subsident conditions aloft this should translate into warm
to hot temperatures across the area. On Friday, look for a moderate
HeatRisk for inland portions of the region as high temperatures
climb into the mid 80s to around 100. Onshore flow and a shallow
marine layer will still prevail along the coast with readings in the
60s and 70s. Temperatures will cool off a bit Friday night in the
lower elevations with readings dipping into the 50s. Relief will be
more limited above 500 feet where lows should remain in the 60s to
lower 70s.

The peak of the heat event arrives over the weekend. This is when
the HeatRisk rises into the moderate to major range for inland areas
with at least a minor risk along the coast. An Excessive Heat
Warning is in effect for most inland areas during this time,
indicating the likelihood for dangerous heat to impact much of the
population. High temperatures will reach 100 to 110 degrees for the
warmest inland locations (East Bay hills, northeast Napa County, and
inland Monterey/southern San Benito Counties), with 90 to 100
degrees expected elsewhere inland. Readings along the coast are a
bit more tricky, but the most likely forecast outcome should keep
them a bit cooler with a shallow marine layer in place. At this
point, places along the immediate coast and bays look to top out
between 70 and 85 degrees. However, we`ll need to keep an eye on
forecast changes just in case the high pressure ridge becomes strong
enough to fully dissipate the marine layer. While not the most
likely forecast outcome, this could result in warmer temperatures
along the coast should it occur. Cooling Saturday night will be
limited given the warm air aloft with elevations above 500 feet
likely remaining in the 70s and 80s overnight. However low
temperatures should dip into the upper 50s to mid 60s within the
lower (and more populated) terrain. Look for a repeat on Sunday with
high temperatures near, to perhaps a few degrees cooler, than those
experienced on Saturday. Lows in the hills will remain quite warm
and in the 70s and 80s. While wind won`t be particularly strong this
weekend, it`s noted that relative humidity values should tank inland
with limited overnight recoveries above 500 feet. Given the
abundance of cured fine fuels (grasses) there remains a concern for
wildfire ignitions as it really won`t take much to get things going.
So please do your part to be "one less spark" this weekend.
Otherwise key messages for keeping safe in the heat are:

* Stay hydrated and cool (use public AC if needed: malls, libraries,
  movie theaters, etc)
* avoid outdoor activities between 1 to 6 pm, including walking your
  pets
* monitor the elderly, young, sick, pets, and livestock for heat
  sensitivity
* double check your vehicles making sure no people or pets are left
  inside while parked in the sun

Monday through Wednesday:

Upper level troughing should impinge on the Pacific Northwest by
early next week. This should weaken the northwest periphery of the
upper level high and bring a stronger onshore flow component and
deeper marine layer to the region. The result will be cooling
temperatures and a reduced HeatRisk. Monday looks to be the
transition day, with inland highs still climbing well into the 90s
to lower 100s. By mid week temperatures will be closer to seasonal
with inland highs in the 80s and 90s and coastal highs in the 60s to
lower 70s.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 424 AM PDT Thu Jul 13 2023

Satellite currently shows stratus lingering near the coast with
the onshore winds pushing some MVFR, IFR and LIFR CIGs somewhat
inland. Stratus is already starting to retreat but expect all
terminals to clear near 16-17Z. As the high pressure system
compresses the marine layer, expect inland terminals to remain VFR
through the TAF period with some coastal areas experiencing a mix of
MVFR, IFR and LIFR conditions. Onshore winds are expected to
become breezy in the afternoon as the coastal gaps may become
gusty. Stratus is expected to return tonight for mostly the
coastal terminals with some uncertainty of stratus for the North
Bay terminals.

Vicinity of SFO...VFR conditions is expected throughout today.
Moderate confidence that MVFR stratus will return over the terminal
early tomorrow morning. Onshore winds are expected become breezy
this morning with gusty winds up to 20 knots with winds returning to
moderate this evening.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...LIFR but conditions are slowly improving.
Expect clearing near 17Z for KSNS and 19-20Z for KMRY. Stratus is
expected to return this evening with IFR ceilings. Moderate
confidence that ceilings may lower to LIFR late tonight, as some
models lack agreement. Winds are expected to increase to 10-12
knots this afternoon with a return of light to moderate winds
tonight.

.MARINE...
(Tonight through next Monday)
Issued at 901 PM PDT Wed Jul 12 2023

Strong to gusty northwesterly winds continue over the northern
waters through the weekend, slowly extending south over the outer
waters. The SF Bay and Delta will generally see breezy to gusty
conditions increasing into the afternoons before winds diminish
into the night. These stronger winds will result in steep wind
waves and hazardous conditions to small craft. Mixed seas of light
northerly and moderate period (8-10 seconds) swell, and light
southerly swell continue through the weekend.
