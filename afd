.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 1234 AM PDT Sun Mar 31 2024

Look for a few more showers today over interior areas otherwise
quieter weather returns through mid week with a warming trend.
Cooler by late week with shower chances returning.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 1234 AM PDT Sun Mar 31 2024

The low pressure system responsible for yesterday`s active weather
is located just offshore from the Central Coast early this morning.
A few showers were ongoing across the region, but coverage and
intensity is much diminished compared to earlier. Showers will
remain few and far between this morning with coverage continuing to
dwindle. By this afternoon and evening a perturbation/vorticity
ribbon along the backside of the upper trough should traverse the
region as residual surface troughing remains in place. Given surface
heating and cold temperatures aloft lapse rates will steepen
especially across interior portions of the Bay Area and Central
Coast. The combined elevated moisture/instability along with weak
troughing nearby should be sufficient to kick off a few showers and
thunderstorms during this time, with the high-res convection
allowing models suggesting the eastern Santa Clara hills through the
San Benito Mountains and far eastern Monterey County as the most
likely locations for convective initiation. There is a weak signal
for shower development across inland portions of the North Bay as
well, but lapse rates are a bit more meager there. So, while we`re
mostly done with the rain we can`t rule out a few more showers and
thunderstorms this afternoon and evening given the conditionally
unstable environment. Thunderstorm hazards today will include
occasional lightning, small hail, brief heavy rainfall, and locally
gusty winds. By tonight this threat will have ended with the trough
departing and a return to quieter weather. High temperatures today
will be seasonally cool and mostly in the lower to mid 60s.
Overnight lows will dip into the 40s.

.LONG TERM...
(Monday through Saturday)
Issued at 1234 AM PDT Sun Mar 31 2024

High pressure aloft will be prevalent for Monday and Tuesday with
pleasant weather and much warmer temperatures. Highs on Tuesday will
mostly be in the upper 60s to mid 70s.

Some cooling will commence by Wednesday as a weak cold front pushes
through ahead of upstream troughing over the northeast Pacific.

The trough will swing through the region by late week with
sufficiently short wavelength to close off an upper low near the CA
coast on Thursday into Friday. This pattern will bring breezy
onshore winds, cooler temperatures, and a return to rain chances.
The best rain potential appears to be on Thursday into Friday
with most likely amounts ranging from a few tenths to around three
quarters of an inch based on the latest ensemble guidance.
Temperatures into the weekend will remain on the cool side.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 432 AM PDT Sun Mar 31 2024

A band of mid level clouds is moving southward across the Bay Area,
patchy low clouds /IFR/ are otherwise forming due to recent rain
moistened atmosphere and current nocturnal radiative cooling to
space. Otherwise VFR during day today, a few patches of low clouds
/MVFR-IFR/ may redevelop tonight and Monday morning.

Vicinity of SFO...VFR. Light wind this morning becoming onshore 10
to 15 knots in the afternoon and early evening. Wind becoming light
and variable late tonight and Monday morning.

SFO Bridge Approach... Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...VFR. Light cool air drainage winds in the
morning becoming onshore 5 to 10 knots in the afternoon. Light
cool air drainage winds redeveloping tonight and Monday morning.

.MARINE...
(Today through Friday)
Issued at 421 AM PDT Sun Mar 31 2024

A high pressure system centered approximately 1000 miles west of
the Bay Area today will begin building in behind the southern
California low pressure system bringing drier, milder conditions
to the Bay Area and north Central Coast early to mid week.
Maritime polar air behind a cold front will move southeastward
reaching the California coastal waters and bays later Wednesday
and Wednesday night. This air mass will be coupled to a deepening
upper level trough and instability bringing a chance of wet
weather beginning Thursday.
