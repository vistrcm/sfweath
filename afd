.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 400 AM PDT Thu Jul 20 2023

A warming trend will develop today through Saturday, temperatures
well inland will be hottest with daytime highs in the 90s to lower
100s, including a few spots far inland reaching up to 107 degrees.
A heat advisory is in effect for inland locations from the North
Bay interior mountains to the East Bay valleys and hills, the Santa
Clara Valley, the eastern Santa Clara Hills, the southern Salinas
Valley, the Santa Lucia Mountains/Los Padres NF and mountains of
San Benito county from 11 am Friday to 11 pm Saturday. Closer to
the bays and coast temperatures will become a little warmer than
normal for late July, however a robust maritime cooling influence
will remain, limiting warmth along the coast and bays. Northerly,
downsloping winds and a compressed marine layer will keep the North
Bay warmest to hottest longest over the weekend, otherwise a cooling
trend redevelops across the forecast area early next week.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 400 AM PDT Thu Jul 20 2023

There are only minor fluctuations seen in the marine layer depth
since early Wednesday morning per profiler data at Bodega Bay,
Fort Ord and Point Sur. At this hour, the marine layer depth
varies from 1100 feet to 1500 feet. Sea surface temperatures north
to south are varying from 51F to 58F with robust northwesterly
winds and cold water upwelling continuing. Nighttime microphysics
imagery and surface observations show plenty of coastal stratus
clouds along with an inland intrusion of stratus, including patchy
fog (patchy light drizzle also possible). Decided to add patchy
light drizzle along the immediate coastline in the forecast
through mid to late morning. Recent RAP wildfire smoke forecasts
also show light amounts of smoke and/or hazy conditions lingering
today from the southwestern OR wildfire.

Under diurnal surface warming and mixing winds, stratus and fog will
mix out to near the beaches again today, while coastal stratus and
fog linger through today then return inland on onshore winds tonight.

Daytime highs today largely varying from near normal along the
coast with highs mainly in the upper 50s, 60s and lower 70s to the
70s to lower 80s bayside, to a few degrees above normal far inland
with highs in the 90s to lower 100s. Tonight lows will lower to
the 50s at most locations except warmer in the hills and mountains
(thermal belts i.e. within the lower level temperature inversion)
lows in the 60s and 70s.

.LONG TERM...
(Friday through Wednesday)
Issued at 400 AM PDT Thu Jul 20 2023

As mentioned in the synopsis above, a heat advisory is in effect
for inland locations from the North Bay interior mountains to the
East Bay valleys and hills, the Santa Clara Valley, the eastern
Santa Clara Hills, the southern Salinas Valley, the Santa Lucia
Mountains/Los Padres NF and mountains of San Benito county from 11
am Friday to 11 pm Saturday. Closer to the bays and coast
temperatures will become a little warmer than normal for late
July, however a robust maritime cooling influence will remain,
limiting warmth along the coast and bays. Northerly, downsloping
winds and a compressed marine layer will keep the North Bay
warmest to hottest longest over the weekend, otherwise a cooling
trend redevelops across the forecast area early next week.

Global model output are consistent with forecasting the center of
the strong 500 mb high pressure system over the southern CONUS to
retrogress to AZ, NV and UT late this week. 500 mb heights and 850
mb temperatures Friday and Saturday will approach the max moving
average on long term Oakland upper air climatology in late July. A
relatively shorter lived uptick in temperatures during this time
will limit peak heating to approx max of two days, except inland
over the North Bay, the ACV-SFO pressure gradient and northerly
winds keeping downsloping and warming going approx a max of three
days. The warm core, strong 500 mb high pressure system over the
western and southern CONUS is, as is usually the case in the warm
season, longitudinally adhering to maximum surface heating under
July solar heating. The westerlies including jet stream winds
rounding the base of the closed cold core 500 mb low near the
Pacific Northwest will nudge the entire weather pattern eastward
across the CONUS early to mid next week, which includes nudging
forward the strong 500 mb high. Weak 500 mb troughing will develop
over northern California, deeper onshore winds and more of a cooler
maritime influence will ease temperatures back to near late July
normals next week, even well inland. At this time, it does not
appear any significant subtropical moisture or instability will
reach around the western periphery of the 500 mb high this weekend,
rather the mid-latitude flow will also nudge in drier columnar
precipitable waters from the west and northwest. Surface dewpoint
temperatures (water vapor) on the other hand continue to look
sufficiently elevated enough on northwest coastal winds to keep
maritime stratus and fog going next week.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 507 AM PDT Thu Jul 20 2023

IFR at many terminals across the region this morning as low CIGs
from stratus continue. Nighttime satellite imagery shows stratus
currently enveloping much of the SF and Monterey bays, and reaching
far down the Salinas Valley into northern SLO county/Paso Robles
area. Expect stratus to mix out around the late morning hours to
become VFR. Winds generally westerly increasing into the afternoon
with speeds 10-15 knots, higher for KSFO. Winds decrease into the
evening to become light, generally below 8 knots for most terminals.

Stratus redevelopment in the evening to late night tomorrow is
uncertain. But, as high pressure and therefore ridging begin to
build into the region, expecting the marine layer to compress and
therefore inhibit stratus development. At this time, not expecting
CIGs to develop for terminals north of Monterey Bay. Though,
scattered low clouds may be present.

Vicinity of SFO...Currently VFR, and expected to last through the
TAF period. Few low clouds have been reported throughout the night,
though no CIG formation. Expecting few low clouds to persist through
much of the TAF period. Winds increase out of the west this
afternoon to become moderate around 17 knots, then decreasing into
the early morning hours of Friday.

SFO Bridge Approach...Low clouds currently obstructing approach.
Expecting to mix/scatter out towards the later morning to become
VFR.

Monterey Bay Terminals...LIFR CIGs persist through the late morning
with clearing to VFR expected around 17Z at KSNS. At KMRY, clearing
expected to be considerably later, closer to 21Z, and brief before a
return to IFR-LIFR ceilings in the early evening. Winds westerly to
northwesterly this afternoon with speeds up to 12 knots, becoming
light overnight (below 6 knots).

.MARINE...
(Today through Tuesday)
Issued at 507 AM PDT Thu Jul 20 2023

Moderate to gusty northwesterly winds continue through the weekend
and into the beginning of next week. Winds through the Golden
Gate and into the San Pablo Bay and Delta will strengthen each
afternoon and early evening to become moderate before
diminishing. Towards the weekend, building surface high pressure
over the eastern Pacific will lead to increased northwesterly
winds, at times gusting to gale force conditions. Wind waves will
create hazardous conditions for small craft operators. Light
southerly swell persists through the week.
