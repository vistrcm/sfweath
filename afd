.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 301 AM PST Mon Mar 3 2025

Lingering showers dissipate into the afternoon. Light chances

Thursday. The higher rainfall amounts will be focused around the
Big Sur Coast. Additional rains look to arrive in the late
weekend.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 301 AM PST Mon Mar 3 2025

Most areas are starting to see the last of their rain chances for
this system. The exceptions are around the Monterey Bay and along
the Big Sur Coast with passing light showers expected to linger
through the late morning. High resolution modes are in good
agreement that these last few spotty showers wont be impactful.

Winds look to ease into the day, but stay slightly breezy along the
coast. Temperatures will climb into the 50s for most areas, with a
few 60s possible for the afternoon. Temperatures will fall quickly
into the early night, slow the rate of cooling into the late night
as cloud cover begins to build again. Some of the more interior
areas could see lows in the mid 30s, while most stick to the upper
30s and lower 40s.

.LONG TERM...
(Tuesday through Sunday)
Issued at 301 AM PST Mon Mar 3 2025

Hopefully you enjoy the dry weather on the second half of Monday,

because rain is back on Tuesday, but it`s light!

The forecast PoPs grids required a fair amount of polishing to
account for an odd timing error in the national blend of models, but
otherwise the picture looks fairly clear for the Mid-week rains.

The initial cold front arrives mid-morning Tuesday, but
significantly weakens before making landfall. This means rains look
very light, with some higher-resolution models not entertaining
frontal moisture making it any farther than the shoreline. These
light rains linger into that night.

But then the parent low of the cold front rolls down the coast and
moves inland over the SF Bay early Wednesday. This will place
scattered shower activity across the Bay Area through late
Thursday.

The more meteorologically interesting part of this system will be
the southern edge of this low as it collects a plume of moisture
left off shore by Tuesdays cold front. The low will push this
moisture into the Big Sur Coast, offering more moderate rainfall
rates, with the potential for moments of higher rates.. Because of
this, the WPC placed the Big Sur Coast and the southern Salinas
Valley in a Marginal (5%) Excessive Rainfall Outlook, so it will be
something the forecaster team keeps an eye on.

As of the current forecast, the Tues-Thurs rains add up to:

0.15" 0.40" for the Bay Area

0.50" to 1" for the San Mateo Coast and the southern Santa Clara
Valley as well as  Santa Cruz, Monterey, and San Benito counties.

1" to 1.75" for the Santa Lucias and Big Sur.

The last few rains from the mid week system exit into Thursday
night. Longer term models continue to offer another low pressure
moving another round of rains across the region this Sunday with
even more chances to follow into the next work week.

So, enjoy those short periods of dry weather!
