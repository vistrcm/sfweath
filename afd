.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 201 AM PST Fri Nov 10 2023

A pleasant weekend is in store before a deep low pressure system
brings significant rain to the Bay Area next week.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 1239 AM PST Fri Nov 10 2023

A shortwave trough was evident on water vapor imagery this morning
moving into NorCal. The surface reflection was via a weak cold front
which was analyzed just northwest of Eureka at 10.06Z. A weak plume
of moisture was accompanying this front, but was focused largely
offshore. Therefore the front is expected to continue its southward
progression through the region today with little fanfare, outside of
the small chance for a light shower or two over the North Bay this
morning. After some increase in mid to high level cloud coverage
this morning skies should clear for most areas during the second
half of the day with seasonably pleasant temperatures in the 60s to
lower 70s this afternoon. Look for clear skies for most areas
tonight outside of a few low stratus patches around the bays. Lows
should generally be in the mid 40s to around 50, with upper 30s to
lower 40s in the coolest valleys of the North Bay and southern
Monterey County.

.LONG TERM...
(Saturday through Thursday)
Issued at 201 AM PST Fri Nov 10 2023

Saturday and Sunday:

A shortwave ridge will follow Friday`s trough. This feature will
support higher surface pressure, partly cloudy skies, light winds
and mild temperatures this weekend. These conditions favor morning
fog, which is most likely in the North Bay valleys. Some of the
cooler inland areas of southern Monterey County will drop into
the upper 30s, while portions of the North Bay interior valleys
drop into the lower 40s. These temperatures are a few degrees
warmer than the last few days, and will quickly increase after
sunrise. Overall, the weekend looks pleasant and will provide a
good opportunity to prepare for the significant rain next week.

Monday through Thursday:

A cold occlusion will reach the West Coast on Monday. The rain
associated with this feature looks marginal at best, but it will
trigger a major regime change. The real weather maker is a gale
force low pressure system that will develop in the cold air
behind the front. This feature will be supported by a very deep
trough in the jet stream, that will either cause to upper level
flow to become highly meridional, or dig deep enough to be cut-
off and left behind the main jet stream flow. Either way, after
the low develops Monday night or early Tuesday, it will not have
much steering flow. This will cause it to linger off the coast
causing persistent southerly flow to pump moisture into the Bay
Area for several days.

The details are still subject to change, but the current forecast
calls for light rain to begin Monday in the North Bay before
widespread and heavier downpours begin Tuesday. Coastal mountains
will be hotspots and will likely receive several inches of rain
due to the orographic enhancement of the persistent onshore flow.

As mentioned in the previous discussion, with this much lead time
probabilistic forecasting with ensembles is typically better than
looking at each deterministic run, especially when searching for
trends. Both the GEFS and ECMWF EPS ensemble means are roughly
around 1.5" of rain for San Francisco through the week, with very
few (1/30 GEFS, 4/50 EPS) members staying below 0.5". The NBM
probabilities are even more bullish, with an average of 50-75%
chance of exceeding 2" across much of the Bay Area, with closer to
90% in the coastal mountains, and 30-40% in the Santa Clara and
Salinas Valleys.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 314 AM PST Fri Nov 10 2023

Prevailing VFR with SCT-BKN mid to high level clouds. There
remains a low confidence (20-30% probability) for MVFR-IFR
stratus development at the immediate coast and along the OAK-SJC
corridor, but confidence is too low for inclusion in the TAFs.
Patchy BR is also possible around the North Bay terminals this
morning, but confidence is low. Generally light winds with an
onshore component developing this afternoon. Low stratus
development potentially more likely around San Francisco Bay late
tomorrow night. For now hinted at this potential with SCT lower
cloud groups.

Vicinity of SFO...VFR is the most likely outcome for much of the
TAF period. Low confidence (20-30% probability) for MVFR-IFR
ceiling this morning but will not carry this in the TAFs. Light
winds become onshore this afternoon. Stratus potential returns
late tonight with 20-30% chance for ceiling development. For now
hinted at this potential with SCT lower cloud group.

SFO Bridge Approach... Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...Prevailing VFR is the most likely
forecast outcome through the TAF period. Light drainage winds this
morning become onshore this afternoon.

.MARINE...
(Today through Wednesday)
Issued at 1239 AM PST Fri Nov 10 2023

Gentle to moderate northerly breezes this morning will become
fresh to strong later today across much of the outer waters and
along the Big Sur coast. Another moderate period northwest swell
train arrives today as a weak low pressure system brings small
rain chances to the waters today into tonight. Winds turn
southerly by early next week with a strong weather system bringing
rain along with hazardous winds and seas for mid to late next
week.
