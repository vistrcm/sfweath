.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 241 AM PDT Fri Aug 11 2023

We`ve been monitoring the radar all night with increasing returns
across Monterey and San Benito counties. So far most of the
lightning has remained just offshore near the SLO county line,
roughly west of Hearst Castle. As noted for the last several days
this is remnant moisture from Eugene and the center of the upper
low is now spinning near the SLO/Monterey county line. Bands of
moisture rotating from the Central Valley continue to blossom and
move westward over the Central Coast and over the ocean waters.
So far most activity has been light (as was expected) with amounts
generally a few hundredths. The highest total so far has been
0.11 at a weather station above 5000 feet in San Benito county.
Most recently Salinas Airport reported a trace of light rain last
hour while the Monterey airport was reporting fog at 3/4 mile
vsby. The HRRR model seems to have a good grasp on the latest
trends and suggests the peak of shower/t-storms will occur from
now through mid-morning. By lunchtime the forecast looks dry
though cant completely rule out an isolated shower or t-storm this
afternoon the latest forecast has 10 percent chances this
afternoon for the Central Coast.

Meanwhile the Bay Area is under a 1500 foot marine layer as some
remnant high clouds will pass overhead through the day. The slow
moving and wobbling upper low wont move too much today and thus
not expecting shower chances north of about Gilroy. So much ado
about nothing for the Bay Area with a seasonal August day
featuring 60s coast, 70s bayside and mainly 80s inland.

.LONG TERM...
(Saturday through Thursday)
Issued at 241 AM PDT Fri Aug 11 2023

The upper low will gradually fill and most precip should stay over
the Sierra on Saturday with seasonal conditions for the Bay Area
and Central coast meaning morning low clouds will give way to
partly sunny skies in the afternoon (some remnant high clouds may
still be around). The general trend for Sunday and Monday will be
inland warming as 90s to near 100 degree heat returns for the most
interior locations. The increase in temperatures will be from a
building ridge over the Pacific Northwest that will cut off the
previous upper low allowing it to stall and fill well west of San
Francisco. The combination of the remnant moisture and cyclonic
flow may lead to thunderstorms across Northern California and the
Sierra early in the week but not expected for the Bay Area. Some
weak northerly flow down the Central Valley may produce some light
nighttime northeast winds for the Napa hills Monday and Tuesday
meaning warm nights inland.

The synoptic pattern stays nearly stationary at least through
about Thursday so hard to forecast much day to day change in the
mid to long range. By about Friday and into next weekend a
longwave trough is augured by the models to bring increased
onshore flow and a return to more seasonal temperatures for
inland locales.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 435 AM PDT Fri Aug 11 2023

Upper low continues to spin over Monterey/SLO county line, so will
continue to see FEW-SCT high clouds through the taf period. Low cloud
decks have been steadily raising the last few hours, so higher
confidence in MVFR- IFR persisting through the early morning hours
rather than localized LIFR near the coast as per previous TAF
thinking. Low clouds will dissipate around 15-17z for inland
terminals and 18-19z for terminals closer to the coast. Moderate
westerly winds in store for today with highest gusts near KOAK
this afternoon (up to 25 knots). Low clouds return this evening -
likely similar cloud deck heights as synoptic pattern will stay
fairly unchanged, resulting in borderline MVFR- IFR conditions.

Vicinity of SFO...MVFR or soon to be MVFR as cloud decks steadily
rise this morning. Low clouds dissipate around 18z this morning
and will return later this evening between 03z-04z, bringing
MVFR-IFR conditions again. West winds expected today, becoming
breezy in the afternoon.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...IFR through the 17-19z (later for KMRY).
VFR will prevail briefly this afternoon before IFR low clouds
come back early this evening. Onshore winds around 10-15 knots
expected this afternoon with breeziest winds over the Salinas
Valley.

.MARINE...
(Today through Wednesday)
Issued at 231 AM PDT Fri Aug 11 2023

Scattered rain showers are currently moving over the coastal
waters south of Point Pinos and will continue through the late
morning today. Moderate to fresh northwest breezes persist across
the northern outer waters, while breezes across the rest of the
waters south of Point Arena will be fairly light to gentle into
early next week. Moderate period southerly swell at 12 to 14
seconds continues in addition to moderate period northwesterly
swell which will slowly build through early next week. Longer
period, light southwesterly swell arrives this weekend.
