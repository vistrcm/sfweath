...New AVIATION...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 115 AM PDT Fri Jul 28 2023

Quiet weather continues with seasonal temperatures. Expect the
typical ebb and flow of coastal clouds each night/morning giving
way to sunny afternoon conditions across the interior. Breezy
onshore winds will occur each afternoon.

&&

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 115 AM PDT Fri Jul 28 2023

Southwest flow prevails aloft as we remain sandwiched between an
upper low pressure area over the northeast Pacific and strong high
pressure over the southern CONUS. Some expansion of the marine layer
depth has occurred during the previous day, with profilers placing
its depth between approximately 1000 and 1300 feet early this
morning. Stratus was quickly expanding around the coast and bays, and
should encompass much of the coast and coast adjacent valleys this
morning. Patchy fog and drizzle are anticipated as well; particularly
for the San Mateo coast and around Monterey Bay. Look for clearing
towards the coast during the late morning hours with most areas
seeing sunshine by noon if not earlier. Temperatures will be
seasonal, if not slightly cooler than average. Highs will range from
the 80s and 90s across the interior (locally around 100 in southern
Monterey County) to the 60s and 70s for the coasts, bays, and near-
coastal Valleys. Expect a repeat performance with late night stratus
tonight with lows mostly in the 50s.

.LONG TERM...
(Saturday through Thursday)
Issued at 115 AM PDT Fri Jul 28 2023

The large-scale picture will remain fairly static with upper
troughing from western Canada into NorCal and strong high pressure
over the southern CONUS. Subtle daily changes in temperatures and
cloud cover should occur as these upper features battle for
influence but otherwise nothing really noteworthy in the weather
department through late week.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 435 AM PDT Fri Jul 28 2023

IFR ceilings expanding around SF Bay, up the Sonoma Valley, and
around Monterey Bay early this morning. High confidence in IFR
developing/continuing for KOAK/KSTS/KAPC. Lower confidence for
KSFO where a SCT lower cloud group was carried for prevailing.
Despite this, lower clouds will ebb and flow around the terminal
and potentially within the approach through late morning. High
confidence in ceiling and visibility reductions at the Monterey
Bay terminals. Return to VFR expected for all locations between
16-18Z. Winds will be light and onshore, except breezy through the
coastal gaps during the late afternoon and evening hours.

Vicinity of SFO...Initially VFR, but with low clouds surrounding
the terminal to the west, north, and east. Can`t rule out an IFR
window 13-16Z but confidence too low for inclusion in the TAF. A
TEMPO amendment is possible should lower clouds approach the
terminal again. Any potential ceiling should mix out around
16-17Z. VFR This afternoon and evening with breezy westerly winds.
Medium to high potential for sub-VFR ceiling late tonight after
10Z.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...IFR-LIFR conditions present or developing
within the next hour. Primary concern is ceilings, but visibility
reductions in BR are possible heading towards daybreak as well.
Improving to VFR 16-18Z with light onshore winds. Sub-VFR
conditions return 05-08Z tonight.

.MARINE...
(Tonight through next Tuesday)
Issued at 838 PM PDT Thu Jul 27 2023

Gusty northwest winds continue over the coastal waters through
early next week, resulting in wind waves creating hazardous sea
conditions for small crafts. Gusty afternoon and evening winds
will redevelop daily over the San Francisco Bay north of the Bay
Bridge to the Delta as well as across the Monterey Bay. Light
southerly swell mixing with a northwesterly swell will persist
through early next week.
