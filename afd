.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 239 AM PDT Fri May 9 2025

Above normal temperatures through Saturday. Unsettled weather
returns Monday with below normal temperatures, moderate winds,
light rainfall, and a 10% chance for thunderstorms.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and Saturday) Issued at 239 AM PDT Fri May 9 2025

A Heat Advisory goes into effect at 10AM this morning for the
Southern Salinas Valley and runs through 9PM Saturday. Hot
conditions can cause heat illness if outdoors for long periods,
especially with physical exertion. Hydration is a critical piece to
mitigating the heat. Drink water, take breaks, find shade, and if
possible, help those who are vulnerable. The driver behind this is
an upper-level longwave ridge across the West. 850 millibar
temperatures are a good proxy for the air mass as a whole and this
afternoon`s (May 9th 00Z) KOAK sounding observed an 850 millibar
temperature of 16.15 degrees Celsius which falls between the 75th
and 90th percentile for today`s date. As is typical with high
pressure and subsequently subsidence, a shallow marine layer of 300
feet is being observed on the Fort Ord profiler with some fog trying
to develop over Tomales Bay and some stratus creeping northward
along the coast from San Luis Obispo County to Monterey County.
Without the insight of a thermometer, today and tomorrow will feel
very similar with temperatures generally 10 degrees above normal
away from the immediate coast. I want to highlight the Santa Clara
Valley, East Bay Interior Valleys, and the Interior Central Coast as
being the areas with the greatest risk (moderate HeatRisk).
Interests in these areas should reduce time in the sun during the
warmest part of the day, stay hydrated, stay in a cool place during
the heat of the day, move outdoor activities to cooler times of the
day, and for those without a/c, use fans to keep air moving and open
windows at night. The rest of the region will experience minor
HeatRisk and should increase hydration, reduce time spent outdoors
or stay in the shade when the sun is strongest, and open windows at
night and use fans to bring cooler air inside buildings. No records
are in jeopardy.

.LONG TERM...
(Sunday through Thursday) Issued at 239 AM PDT Fri May 9 2025

Heights begin to fall Sunday as an open wave develops off the
Pacific Northwest coast, nudging the upper-level longwave ridge to
the east. Uncertainty has reduced significantly as global ensemble
clusters are in agreement of the open wave remaining progressive. As
a result, QPF (quantitative precipitation forecast) has gone up
across the region with 0.10-0.30 inches forecast for the North Bay,
and less than 0.10 inches elsewhere. Overall this will not be an
impactful system from the perspective of daily life; however, it
cannot be stated enough that as we exit the wet season and enter the
dry season, our attention turns towards fire weather. If the
official QPF forecast verifies, not only will the North Bay receive
beneficial rainfall, but they will receive wetting rains (greater
than or equal to 0.10 inches) which would be great news for fire
interests as fuels in that region are the driest in our CWA. On this
note, there`s also a low probability/high impact threat for
thunderstorms. As of now it doesn`t look overly impressive for our
area based on point soundings from global deterministic models. The
ingredients that we are working with are as follows...lift: a cold
front, a 700 millibar shortwave trough with a vorticity maximum, and
a decaying 125 knot jet streak at 300 millibars, instability: cold
air above warm air with low CAPE values and stable to conditionally
unstable lapse rates, moisture: precipitable water values up to 0.70
inches. If a thunderstorm were to develop the threats include
lightning, small hail, and locally heavy rainfall and gusty winds.
Temperatures will be to 10 to 20 degrees below normal Monday and
Tuesday with the Oakland Museum (OAMC1) forecast to approach its
daily minimum temperature records of 47 degrees set in 1974 on
Tuesday and Wednesday, the official forecast is 50 degrees. Heights
will likely begin to rebuild Wednesday as an upper-level longwave
ridge noses into the Eastern Pacific Ocean, bringing temperatures
back to near seasonal normals by Thursday.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 513 AM PDT Fri May 9 2025

VFR conditions continue with the exception of HAF and the Monterey
Bay. HAF will see coastal CIGs through the morning before eroding,
while the Monterey Bay looks to see moments of CIGs and some
inconsistent pockets of fog through the mid morning. Moderate west
winds build in the afternoon as widespread VFR re-establishes, with
breezier winds expected at SFO. Winds across the region reduce into
the night. HAF`s visibility`s look to fall again due to mist into the
night.


Vicinity of SFO...VFR through the TAF period. Winds stay light to
moderate into the afternoon, then west-northwest winds build around
18 kts with 25kt gusts. Gusts cut off and winds reduce into the
early night, but stay moderate.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...Patches of fog are forming around MRY,
offering spotty coverage through the mid morning. Models are also
hinting at inconsistent CIGs affecting SNS until the mid morning as
well. Cloud cover and fog erodes before the late morning and winds
increase ahead of the midday, becoming moderate. Expect winds to
reduce into the evening, becoming light and variable at MRY, but
mostly northerly for SNS.


&&

.MARINE...
(Today through Wednesday)
Issued at 513 AM PDT Fri May 9 2025

Light to moderate northerly winds continue into late Friday
morning, before building into the weekend. Light rain will be
possible on Monday as a frontal passage moves across the region.
Moderate seas continue through the end of the forecast period.
