...New SYNOPSIS, SHORT TERM, LONG TERM, AVIATION, MARINE...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 337 AM PST Sat Dec 7 2024

Temperatures slightly above seasonal averages prevail this weekend
with slightly cooler and breezier conditions to start off the work
week. Chances for showers over the coastal waters through the
evening, with better chances for rain later in the week through the
upcoming weekend.

&&

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 337 AM PST Sat Dec 7 2024

Generally clear skies across the region with patchy radiational fog
and stratus across the North Bay valleys, with further development
possible in the West Delta. Low temperatures are around seasonal
averages in the lower elevations, with lows in the lower to middle
40s inland and closer to the upper 40s to near 50 along the Pacific
coast, perhaps into the mid 50s along the Santa Lucia mountains.

A cold front over the eastern Pacific is closing into the western
United States, associated with a low pressure system currently over
the eastern Gulf of Alaska. This low pressure system moves towards
Haida Gwaii. For those of you not well-versed in Canadian geography,
this is the archipelago that sits off the northern coast of British
Columbia, just south of southeast Alaska. As the low crosses into
British Columbia, it dissipates. As a result, by the time the cold
front makes it into central California, it too is dissipating, and
whatever precipitation potential it may have had is limited to
coastal drizzle with practically zero chance of measurable
precipitation (0.01" or more). High temperatures range from the
middle 60s to lower 70s in the inland valleys to the upper 50s to
middle 60s along the Pacific coast, or about a 2 to 3 degree drop in
high temperatures across the Bay Area while some areas of the
interior Central Coast maintain highs around those on Friday.

.LONG TERM...
(Sunday through Friday)
Issued at 337 AM PST Sat Dec 7 2024

High temperatures continue to dip on Sunday with a couple more
degrees of cooling, particularly in the interior Central Coast.
Later on Sunday into Monday, high pressure develops in the Great
Basin on the back of the cold front, leading to a period of offshore
flow throughout the region. The gustiest winds are expected in the
higher elevations of the interior North Bay and East Bay. Of those,
the highest gusts are expected along the crest of the Vaca Mountains
on the eastern border of Napa County, where the chances for wind
gusts reaching 35 mph or above on Monday reach 40-60%. Wind gusts in
the rest of the region top out near 20-30 mph, so there`s not enough
confidence for a Wind Advisory. In addition, with the recent
rainfall and lighter winds across the rest of the region, widespread
fire weather concerns are not expected, despite fuels remaining
drier in the interior Central Coast.

Clear skies and light winds will promote more radiational cooling
late Monday into Tuesday, with low temperatures reaching the low to
mid 30s in the inland valleys, especially across the North Bay and
Central Coast. The operations team considered issuing a Frost
Advisory, but elected to wait another day to see how the forecast
would evolve. Even so, consider how would you tend to sensitive
plants and vegetation, as well as pets and those without adequate
heating.

Towards the latter part of the next week, considerable uncertainty
still remains regarding chances for more widespread rain. On the
surface, ensemble means appear to show a trough approaching the West
Coast on Friday heading into the weekend. Closer analysis in the
ensemble model clusters reveals that around half of the ensemble
members showing some type of ridge over the western United States,
which would limit our potential rainfall totals, and potentially
translating the significant rainfall towards the north, perhaps as
far north as British Columbia and southeastern Alaska. The other
half place an amplified trough into the state and thus see more
significant rainfall coming into northern and central California.
For what it`s worth, the current forecast shows PoPs above 50%
beginning to edge into the North Bay on Friday and spread into the
Bay Area by Saturday, but this could very well mean anything from a
light, mainly beneficial rainfall, to a much more impactful rain and
wind system. Keep track with the forecasts throughout the next week,
as additional model guidance comes in and the forecast becomes
further refined.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 337 AM PST Sat Dec 7 2024

A mixed bag of slight conditions to start the day with patchy fog
and mist in the North Bay terminals and some ground fog reported
at Oakland. These conditions will steadily improve after the sun
rises. Otherwise VFR conditions will prevail through the
afternoon, with light, shifting winds and increasing high cloud
coverage signaling a weak disturbance on the horizon. As this
system approaches the area overnight, there is a higher chance
for MVFR ceilings at the coastal terminals.

Vicinity of SFO...Low clouds are unlikely to develop this morning
as the weather balloon is finding a dry layer of air above the
surface. There`s a better chance tonight into Sunday morning as a
disturbance approaches the area, but it`s still close to 50-50 at
this point. Otherwise winds will be light to gentle with a
diurnal shift to onshore in the afternoon.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...VFR expected to prevail through the day
with gentle winds and increasing high cloud coverage. There`s a
60% chance for MVFR clouds at MRY overnight, and around 40% at
SNS.

&&

.MARINE...
(Today through Thursday)
Issued at 337 AM PST Sat Dec 7 2024

A gentle to moderate N breeze continues today before a weak cold
front moves through on Sunday. This will bring a fresh to strong N
breeze and build rough seas. Winds will decrease Sunday night,
allowing seas to abate by Monday afternoon. Gentle, shifting wind
and a moderate NW swell will persist through the remainder of
next week.

.MTR WATCHES/WARNINGS/ADVISORIES...
CA...None.
PZ...Small Craft Advisory from 9 PM this evening to 3 PM PST Sunday
     for Pigeon Pt to Pt Pinos 10-60 NM-Pt Arena to Pt Reyes 10-
     60 NM.
