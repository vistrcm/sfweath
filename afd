...New UPDATE, MARINE...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 1252 AM PDT Wed Sep 18 2024

Chance of scattered showers today, tapering off from north to
south gradually through Thursday morning. A warming trend is on
tap for the rest of the week with seasonal normal temps expected
by the weekend.

&&

.UPDATE...
Issued at 924 AM PDT Wed Sep 18 2024

Precipitation over the region has been mainly across the northern
Santa Cruz Mountains and into the East Bay with reports up to 0.06"
at Rocky Ridge (RGEC1). However, expecting rain to increase over the
North Bay in the next couple of hours as a rain band approaches the
region. As the low pressure center remains offshore, rain is
expected to be less widespread as once thought with the region
picking up around a trace to a few hundredths of an inch through the
afternoon and evening. That said, the forecast remains on track with
no updates anticipated at this time.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and Thursday)
Issued at 1252 AM PDT Wed Sep 18 2024

The next system is currently moving in, made noticeable by the
influx of higher cloud cover through the evening. As of about
midnight, the surface low was located just off the coast of
Oregon. The low will move southward through this morning, bringing
light rain chances to the Bay Area by mid-to-late morning. There
is a slight chance (~15%) of thunder during this time period,
mainly in the North Bay. As the low moves through, moisture
wrapping around the back side will affect areas south of the Bay
Area, including the Central Coast, by the middle of Thursday
morning. There is also a slight chance of thunder here during this
time. Though a small chance, there could be some terrain
enhancement over the Santa Lucia, resulting in isolated, brief
heavier rain than what will be seen elsewhere. Shower activity
ends gradually Thursday evening as the low moves inland.

.LONG TERM...
(Friday through Tuesday)
Issued at 1252 AM PDT Wed Sep 18 2024

A warming trend will kick off Friday into the weekend as the upper
low exits and confidence grows in an a broad upper level ridge
situated off the west coast. Temperatures through the weekend are
expected to be near seasonal normals. Warming continues into early
next week where we will begin to see slightly above normal
temperatures.
