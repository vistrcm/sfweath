.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 1123 PM PST Wed Jan 31 2024

Scattered showers persist today with unsettled conditions
persisting into late week. Another storm system takes aim on the
region on Sunday into Monday with another round of heavy rain and
gusty winds possible. Keep up with forecast changes.

.SHORT TERM...
(Thursday and Thursday night)
Issued at 1123 PM PST Wed Jan 31 2024

A powerful low pressure system was occluding offshore from the
Pacific Northwest with its associated surface cold front pushing
onshore across the Bay Area. Bands of moderate to occasionally heavy
rain were occuring along and ahead of the front within a moist and
convergent warm advection regime. As the front progresses this
should allow the heavier/steadier precipitation to advance through
the region with rain rates on the decrease through the early morning
hours. It`s been a busy evening for radar watch with several Flood
Advisories still in effect. Flooding so far has been mainly of the
nuisance variety with flooding of streams, urban areas, and roadways
being the primary reports received so far. Winds were quite active
as well with gusts of 60-70 mph reported within the peaks. However
winds are on the downswing with wind products soon expiring.

For the remainder of the day a surface trough attendant to the
occluding low should swing through the region. This, combined with
cold temperatures aloft will result in instability showers across
the Bay Area and Central Coast today. Can`t rule out a few claps of
thunder or some small hail as well given elevated instability and
lowering freezing levels. Rain amounts this afternoon shouldn`t be
overly impressive, but can`t rule out some localized amounts around
0.25" or greater within some of the heavier convective showers.

Expect a cooling trend in temperatures with highs in the 50s and
lows tonight dropping into the 40s. Some of the colder inland areas

.LONG TERM...
(Friday through next Wednesday)
Issued at 1123 PM PST Wed Jan 31 2024

Friday and Saturday:

A series of low amplitude perturbations will ride zonal flow across
the region. Given residual moisture on-and-off showers remain in the
forecast. Overall rain amounts during this period should remain
light.

Sunday and Monday:

Considerable amplification of the upper flow pattern evolves as a
low pressure system develops off the  California coast. There are
some model differences in the evolution of the the surface low and
how rapidly it deepens, but overall this has the makings of another
impactful system. Some factors in play include plenty of dynamics
and a focused push of warm/moist advection via a 50 kt southwesterly
low-level jet (LLJ). Impacts from rain and wind appear likely, with
a particular focus on the Santa Cruz and Santa Lucia ranges.
Forecast rain amounts have increased, with most likely totals in the
3-7" range for the coastal ranges with lesser amounts for inland
areas and the rain shadowed valleys. The Weather Prediction Center`s
Day 3 Excessive Rainfall Outlook now highlights much of our area
within a slight risk with the Climate Prediction Center`s extended
risk outlook highlighting our area for heavy rainfall. In addition
given the strength of the LLJ we may run into issues with downed
trees and power lines as well. Keep up with forecast changes as we
fine tune this potentially impactful period.

Tuesday and Wednesday:

Troughing aloft appears to keep hold on the area. This should keep
periodic shower chances in place.
