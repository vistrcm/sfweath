...New UPDATE...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 1235 AM PST Tue Mar 5 2024

Rain chances persist through Wednesday with drier conditions by
late week. Unsettled conditions return for early next week with
rain back in the forecast. Overall not looking for anything overly
impactful weather-wise through the next 7 days or so.

.UPDATE...
Issued at 836 AM PST Tue Mar 5 2024

Morning visible satellite imagery and regional webcams show
increasing clouds across the Bay Area and Central Coast. These
clouds are associated with an approaching low pressure system
lurking off the coast. The region is in the warm sector of this
approaching low pressure system, which definitely promotes
increasing clouds. KMUX radar remains in precip mode early this
morning as it continues to detect a few passing showers/virga
ahead of the approaching low pressure.

No update needed this morning as current forecast handles the
light rain chances today. Better chances for precip tonight.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 1235 AM PST Tue Mar 5 2024

A closed upper low will slowly migrate from near 40N135W to just
offshore from the Central Coast tonight. The associated surface
frontal zone will locate to our north today before moving into the
Bay Area tonight. This should confine rain chances today to areas
north of the Golden Gate, with the best potential over northern Napa
and Sonoma Counties. By late tonight those chances will increase for
coastal portions of the Bay Area and Central Coast as well. Given
the core of the low looks to remain offshore precipitation amounts
should be much more limited for interior portions of the Bay Area
and Central Coast where only a few hundredths of an inch are
expected. Otherwise look for around 0.25-0.75" in the Sonoma Hills
with 0.1-0.25" in the North Bay Valleys for today into tonight.
Temperatures will remain cool-ish with plenty of cloud cover around
and highs mostly in the upper 50s to lower 60s. Lows tonight will be

.LONG TERM...
(Wednesday through Monday)
Issued at 1235 AM PST Tue Mar 5 2024

The upper low will make its closest approach to the Central Coast on
Wednesday before dropping south towards SoCal by Thursday. This will
bring a continuation of shower chances for Wednesday into Wednesday
night with the greatest focus along the Central Coast. Some limited
instability will accompany the upper low so can`t rule out an
isolated storm but this isn`t the most likely scenario as the better
instability remains offshore. However briefly heavy rain rates are
possible in showers Wednesday afternoon but they should be fairly
quick moving with overall limited impacts.

Thursday and Friday will feature cool mornings, more sunshine, and
seasonal afternoons. Highs each day will generally be in the lower
to mid 60s with lows dipping into the upper 30s and 40s.

A troughing pattern looks to establish by early next week with rain
chances returning. Amounts look light to moderate and not overly
impactful at this point in time.

Forecast model ensembles and the latest Climate Prediction Center
outlook suggests a shift towards drier conditions/near-normal
precipitation headings towards mid month.

.MARINE...
(Today through Sunday)
Issued at 327 AM PST Tue Mar 5 2024

Northwest swell continues to diminish through midweek. Gentle to
moderate southerly breezes will persist through today as a
surface low approaches the Northern California coastline. As a
result, shower activity will increase in coverage through
Wednesday. Northwesterly winds will increase and become stronger
Wednesday into Thursday, which will result in elevated and
hazardous seas.
