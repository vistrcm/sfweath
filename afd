.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 1206 AM PDT Mon Apr 28 2025

More seasonal (warmer and drier) weather arrives today and
persists through the work week. Another round of disturbed weather
arrives next weekend with overcast skies, cooler weather, and
strong winds, and a few rain drops possible.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 1206 AM PDT Mon Apr 28 2025

A 500 mb positively tilted trough extends across Southern
California anchored by a low pressure center over the Rockies.
The lower pressure and residual moisture has allowed cloud cover
to linger longer through the night than expected. In the last hour
or so, the stars are finally starting to come out for much of the
Bay Area as drier air moves in. The chance for widespread dense
fog has decreased due to the lingering clouds keeping surface
cooling in check. Despite this, there is still a decent chance
for areas of fog during the Monday commute for areas currently
under clear skies. If fog does form, it will mix out by late
morning as the drying trend continues through the day. Mostly
clear skies are expected this afternoon, which will be a nice
change after a dreary weekend. At the same time, warmer air will
filter in as a high pressure ridge moves in from the Eastern
Pacific. Maximum temperatures should climb to the low to mid 70s
for inland areas. Coastal areas will stay in the low 60s with some
morning clouds as a 1000-foot marine layer starts to organize.

.LONG TERM...
(Tuesday through Sunday)
Issued at 1206 AM PDT Mon Apr 28 2025

The overall pattern is dynamic as the current trough exits
Monday, a ridge builds Tue-Wed, a short wave trough moves through
Thursday before a more substantial trough moves through Saturday.
This will cause the SFO-WMC gradient to swing from +7 mb to around
-5 mb mid-week, and back positive by the weekend.

In the medium term the ridge will continue to build, and 850 mb
temperatures are expected to climb from 3.7C on the Sunday 00Z
sounding to roughly 13-15C by mid-week. That`s a pretty drastic
change, warming from around the 20th percentile to the 80th
percentile for this time of year based on the sounding
climatology. This will cause inland temperatures to climb into the
upper 70s Tue-Wed, with mid 60s in the coastal marine layer. A
short wave trough will move through Thursday, though the impacts
will be limited mostly to increased cloud cover. Friday looks like
a transition day as ridging briefly rebuilds before a more
substantial long wave trough moves through Saturday. This system
will bring overcast skies, cooler temperatures, and some light
rain, but the biggest impact will likely be strong winds. The
trough will support a fast moving cold front that will move
through late Friday or early Saturday. As high pressure builds
behind this front, the gradient will support strong NW winds. The
NBM shows roughly an 80% chance of wind gusts exceeding 30 mph on
Saturday for the majority of the area, with about a 40% chance of
exceeding 40 mph along the coast and in higher terrain. The trend
has been increasing, mainly driven by the ECMWF ensemble, which
is quite a bit stronger and more confident than GEFS at this time.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 408 AM PDT Mon Apr 28 2025

Coastal low clouds /MVFR-IFR/ mostly continue from near Point
Reyes southward, inland low clouds /MVFR-IFR/ continue mainly
over the southern third of the area. A few patches of low clouds
are seen over the Bay Area otherwise drying is moving in from the
north. A few patches of valley fog /LIFR-IFR/ will mix out by late
morning. Lower to mid level thermal ridging i.e. air mass stability
will develop and strengthen during the 12z TAF cycle. Coastal
stratus /MVFR-IFR/ develops moving locally inland tonight and
Tuesday morning.

Vicinity of SFO...VFR except tempo MVFR 14z-16z this morning.
Onshore wind 5 to 15 knots, strongest in the afternoon and early
evening.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...MVFR-IFR in low clouds this morning,
clouds mixing out by late morning. Coastal stratus /MVFR-IFR/
develops tonight moving locally inland overnight and Tuesday
morning. Winds mainly onshore 5 to 15 knots, strongest in the
afternoon and early evening.

.MARINE...
(Today through Saturday)
Issued at 355 AM PDT Mon Apr 28 2025

Gusty northwest winds developing due to a high pressure system
building over the offshore waters through early week, winds will
also result in hazardous seas across the outer coastal waters.
Mid to late this week surface high pressure will gradually weaken
while an upper level trough moves in from the northwest. Another
upper level trough from the northwest accompanied by a cold front
will move across the coastal waters and bays late Friday.

.MTR WATCHES/WARNINGS/ADVISORIES...
CA...None.
PZ...Small Craft Advisory from 3 PM this afternoon to 9 PM PDT this
     evening for Pt Arena to Pt Reyes 0-10 nm-Pt Pinos to Pt
