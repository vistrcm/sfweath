.UPDATE...
Issued at 547 AM PDT Wed Jul 23 2025

The 12Z sounding measured the marine layer depth at roughly 2,600
feet as the cut-off low drifts closer to the coast. This is
translating to another drizzlefest with several rain gauges in
the coastal mountains recording a hundredth or two as of 5:30 AM
with more to come through the morning.

.SHORT TERM...
Issued at 1210 AM PDT Wed Jul 23 2025
(Today and tonight)

There were a few interesting things found on the 00Z sounding.
First the marine layer actually compressed from 2,200 feet at 12Z
to 2,000 feet at 00Z. This was in response to somewhat higher
pressure throughout the atmosphere. The 850 mb height increased
from 1487m to 1504m over the same period, while the 500 mb height
increased from 5800m to 5810m. This happened because the cut-off
low lost some upper level divergence when the jet stream pushed
north. The other interesting observation was that the atmosphere
has a lot of moisture. The PWAT was measured at 1.21" as the
balloon traveled through both low and mid-level clouds. That`s
well above the 90th percentile for July 22 (1.09"). With cold
upper air and mid-level moisture we also have to take a look at
convective potential.

Despite the marine layer compression, it`s still deep enough to
support 1,000-1,500 foot cloud layer. Combined with some lift and
SW flow provided by the cut-off low just offshore, there is a
good chance for drizzle across a large portion of the Bay Area and
Central Coast. Measurable amounts are likely in the terrain
enhanced windward side of the coastal mountains. Reminder that
drizzle is simply rain with a small drop size. Broadly speaking
rain drop diameters are roughly 1-2mm, or 10X the diameter of
drizzle drops, which themselves are roughly 10X the diameter of
cloud droplets. Drizzle is supported by the same mechanisms as
rain, just on a smaller scale as they form wholly within the
marine layer stratus.

The actual rain shower threat is decreasing as model guidance
starts to back off and there is no sign of any convective clouds
forming over the water. While the cool upper air, relatively warm
water and high atmospheric moisture were all in place, there just
isn`t enough upper level support to trigger the meager
instability this time.

.LONG TERM...
Issued at 1210 AM PDT Wed Jul 23 2025
(Thursday through Tuesday)

The cut-off low will remain in place through Friday keeping the
pattern pretty stable in the medium term. Expect more cool
temperatures, a robust marine layer, and morning drizzle. There
is a band of mid-level moisture that looks to move through from
South to North late Thursday through early Friday. This could
bring another chance for high-based convection, but the
probability for thunderstorms remains in the single digits. By
the weekend the pattern will start to change, though you may not
notice it. The cut-off low will be picked up by a dip in the jet
stream. This trough will then remain just offshore keeping the
natural AC pumping and temperatures below normal. At the same
time, a four corners high will build bringing triple digit heat
to the desert SW this weekend. While the direct impacts from this
system will stay well to our SE, the periphery effects may bring
our temperatures back to near normal by the end of the month.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 424 AM PDT Wed Jul 23 2025

Currently a mixed bag of IFR-MVFR at the terminals. High confidence
in all terminals improving to VFR by this afternoon as high clouds
from a surface trough are less plentiful than they were 24 hours ago
and thus less impactful. MVFR ceilings will return to most
terminals once again tonight.

Vicinity of SFO...Currently MVFR with southwesterly flow. High
confidence in VFR by the afternoon and an MVFR ceiling returning
tonight. Southwesterly/Westerly flow will prevail through the TAF
period.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...Currently MVFR with westerly flow at both
terminals. High confidence in brief VFR this afternoon with a quick
return of MVFR ceilings. Westerly/Northwesterly flow will prevail
through the TAF period.

.MARINE...
(Today through Monday)
Issued at 424 AM PDT Wed Jul 23 2025

A gentle to moderate northwesterly breeze and slight to moderate
seas will prevail through the week. Low clouds with the
possibility of drizzle will persist through the week.

.MTR WATCHES/WARNINGS/ADVISORIES...
