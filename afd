...New SYNOPSIS, SHORT TERM, LONG TERM, AVIATION, MARINE...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 342 AM PDT Wed Aug 14 2024

Temperatures at or just below normal continue through this week,
as well as breezy onshore flow and a fairly pleasant pattern.

&&

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 342 AM PDT Wed Aug 14 2024

A bit of marine layer compression this morning thanks to a very
brief shortwave ridge aloft. This is keeping most of the stratus
confined to the coastal areas. Evidence of the compression can be
seen looking at the Fort Ord profiler, as well as the 24 hour
temperature trend. Temps are running a few degrees warmer at areas
away from the immediate coast. This trend should be dampened today
though, as yet another progressive trough moves through the
region. Overall expecting temps to be within a couple of degrees
of yesterday`s highs.

&&

.LONG TERM...
(Thursday through Tuesday)
Issued at 342 AM PDT Wed Aug 14 2024

Really not much change in the long term pattern through the rest
of the forecast period. Very little day-to-day change in
temperatures thanks to zonal flow through the end of the week.
Large scale pattern continues to promote troughing off the West
Coast by this weekend and into early next week, which would simply
reinforce a deeper marine layer and perhaps some drizzle along the
coast during the morning hours. We are continuing to message
gusty onshore winds that develop each afternoon during peak
heating. These winds won`t be widespread, but mostly limited to
coastal areas, and locations near gaps, passes, and NW-SE oriented
valleys. The strongest winds are expected through Saturday. Not
expected to be a major fire weather threat thanks to good moisture
supply and the winds diminishing each night, but still a factor
to keep in mind as we near the climatological peak of dry fuels
over the next couple of months.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 342 AM PDT Wed Aug 14 2024

VFR across much of the region this morning is expected to last
through the TAF period. The exception to this is Monterey Bay and
KOAK terminals where stratus is beginning to shroud the terminals
with low IFR CIGs. Clearing of stratus for the impacted terminals is
expected generally towards the 16-17Z window. W/NW winds return in
the afternoon, around 10-15 knots for most terminals, with some
gusts reaching into the 20 knot range for SF Bay terminals. Winds
ease into the late night to become light, and stratus makes a return
for select terminals.

Vicinity of SFO...VFR through the TAF period. Although FEW low
clouds may linger over the terminal this morning, confidence is low
in a CIG forming, therefore have omitted from the TAF Winds increase
out of the W/NW this afternoon to become moderate, with a few gusts
reaching into the 20 knot range. Winds then diminish into the
nighttime to become light.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...IFR CIGs are expected to last through at
least sunrise, but will slowly begin to lift as daytime heating
begins. A return of VFR conditions is expected by the late morning.
Breezy W/NW winds return in the afternoon. Stratus and low CIGs
return in the late evening to KMRY.

&&

.MARINE...
(Today through Monday)
Issued at 342 AM PDT Wed Aug 14 2024

Fresh NW winds will strengthen slightly to become strong over the
outer waters today. Gale force gusts are possible within the
coastal jet south of Point Sur and isolated near gale force gusts
become possible off of Point Arena. Elevated winds will continue
through the end of the work week before beginning to diminish over
the weekend. Seas will remain moderate throughout the forecast
period.
