.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 1231 AM PST Fri Dec 6 2024

Warm and dry weather prevails into the weekend. Slight cooling trend
begins early next week as confidence in cooler and wetter conditions
later next week continues to increase.

&&

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 1231 AM PST Fri Dec 6 2024

Generally clear skies across the region tonight with some high
clouds across the northern reaches of Sonoma County. The clear skies
will lead to cool temperatures across the region, with the coldest
interior locations dropping into the upper 30s to lower 40s, with
temperatures near the coast and Bayshore closer to the upper 40s to
lower 50s. There is also the potential for radiational fog to
develop across the North Bay valleys and the West Delta. The Sonoma
County Airport has already recorded a visibility of 3/4 miles, with
moderate confidence that reduced visibilities continue through the
night.

Conditions remain dry and generally clear through the day, with high
temperatures rising to around 5 to 10 degrees above the seasonal
average with the inland valleys reaching the upper 60s to lower 70s,
and the coast and Bayshore seeing low to mid 60s. A few showers are
possible over the coastal waters later tonight, but the land regions
should remain dry, with the most noticeable impacts being increased
cloud cover over the coastal regions.

.LONG TERM...
Issued at 1231 AM PST Fri Dec 6 2024
(Saturday through next Thursday)

The long term forecast remains relatively stable. The only change
is that the rain chances later next week are starting to come into
the 7-day forecast period, but as earlier noted, it`s too early to
determine exact timing and rainfall totals. The previous
discussion follows:

The longer range forecast is starting to show signs of becoming
more active, as early as this weekend. An upper level low pressure
currently swirling in the Gulf of Alaska finally gets kicked
eastward thanks to a stout jet. A 170+ kt jet currently over
Siberia will push through the Aleutians kicking the low eastward.
As such, our ridge of high pressure aloft gets flattened again
Saturday into Sunday as a low moves through the PacNW. The tail
end of this system will once again brush our northern forecast
area. We`ve been advertising a few showers possible over the
coastal waters Friday night and Saturday and that`s still the
case. Behind the cold front surface high pressure quickly builds
over the Great Basin/OR/ID. This setup up will actually promote
offshore flow beginning Sunday night through Tuesday. Offshore
gradients suggest a moderate offshore flow set up with some gusty
winds over the N and E Bay higher terrain. Santa Cruz/San Mateo
could even get in the the mix for higher terrain gusty winds as
well. While the wind will keep higher elevations mixed/warmer any
sheltered valley will be much colder given the drier airmass. We
may need a mix of freeze/frost products for portions of the Bay
Area and Central Coast.

Offshore flow finally fades Tuesday into Wednesday as inland high
pressure weakens in response to an approaching low pressure. By
next Thursday rain returns to the forecast with rain moving in
from the north. Confidence remains high on this pattern shift
with wet weather return, but confidence remains lower on exact
timing and amounts. FWIW CPC 8-14 day threat hazards does
highlight a large portion of NorCal for rain and wind. Stay tuned
and check back as details become more clear.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 339 AM PST Fri Dec 6 2024

With the common exceptions of morning fog at Santa Rosa and mist
at Half Moon Bay, VFR conditions are expected to prevail through
the majority of the TAF period. Winds will remain light and
diurnally driven. With slightly cooler temperatures expected
Saturday morning, there is a better chance for more widespread
flight restrictions. The probability is still less than 40% for
most sites, and isn`t explicitly mentioned in the TAFs outside of
STS.

Vicinity of SFO...VFR conditions are expected through the
forecast period with light and variable winds becoming a gentle to
moderate WNW breeze by the afternoon. There is a 30-40% chance
for MVFR-IFR ceilings or visibility issues Saturday morning.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...VFR is expected through the forecast
period with mostly light SE winds in the morning eventually
shifting to a gentle NW breeze in the early afternoon. There is a
30-40% chance of some marine-layer type clouds rolling in Saturday
morning, but most guidance keeps the impacts over the water for
now.

.MARINE...
(Today through Wednesday)
Issued at 339 AM PST Fri Dec 6 2024

High pressure and relatively favorable conditions continue to
dominate the coastal waters through Saturday. Bu Sunday, an
approaching cold front will bring a strong N breeze and build
rough seas. Conditions will begin to improve again on Monday.

&&

.MTR WATCHES/WARNINGS/ADVISORIES...
CA...None.
PZ...Small Craft Advisory from 9 PM Saturday to 3 AM PST Sunday for
     Pigeon Pt to Pt Pinos 10-60 NM-Pt Arena to Pt Reyes 10-60
     NM.
