.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 101 AM PST Fri Jan 5 2024

Generally dry through Friday, before light rain comes through on
Saturday. Morning lows becoming colder through the weekend, with the
coldest temperatures on Sunday and Monday morning. Unsettled
conditions return by midweek and will continue at times through the
upcoming week.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 101 AM PST Fri Jan 5 2024

High clouds are streaming across the region early this morning and
will limit the amount of radiational cooling. Expecting temperatures
to drop into the upper 30s to lower 40s across the interior and the
mid 40s to near 50 degrees near the coast/bays.

This afternoon look for mild temperatures generally in the lower 60s
for most while upper 40s to mid 50s are likely in the regions higher
elevations. There will be an increased risk for rip currents at the
coast today. Thus, a Beach Hazard Statement remains in place
from 6 AM PST through the evening hours.

Tonight, slightly cooler especially in the interior portion of the
Central Coast where a Frost Advisory remains in place as
temperatures are likely to cool into the upper 20s to lower 30s.
Increasing clouds will again limit cooling elsewhere, yet will be a
few degrees cooler than this morning.

.LONG TERM...
(Saturday through Thursday)
Issued at 101 AM PST Fri Jan 5 2024

The next shot for widespread rain will be during the day on
Saturday. This will generally be beneficial rain with up to one-
quarter inch in the coastal ranges and a tenth of an inch or less
elsewhere. Unsettled conditions return by midweek and continue at
times throughout the week. However, generally speaking, rainfall
amounts are expected to be less than the Saturday system.

Main issue over the next few days will be colder temperatures
associated with an upper level trough digging into the Great Basin.
Temperatures will start falling into Saturday morning, with the
coldest lows on Sunday and Monday morning. Inland valleys are
expected to drop into the upper 20s to mid 30s, with temperatures in
the mid 20s possible in the coldest spots. Meanwhile, the Bayshore
and Pacific coastal regions see lows ranging from the upper 30s to
the mid 40s. High temperatures during this time will fall into the
mid to upper 50s in the lower elevations, and into the 40s for the
higher elevations. Chilly temperatures could continue into the end
of the next week, as another upper level trough will come into the
Great Basin towards the middle of the upcoming week. Beyond that,
CPC guidance suggests a lean towards temperatures below seasonal
averages, and precipitation totals above the seasonal averages,
through the middle part of January.

To prepare for these cold temperatures, remember the Four P`s of
Winter Weather:

People: Dress in layers and wear a hat that covers the ears. Pay
special attention to children and the elderly, who are more
vulnerable to the cold.
Plants: Bring potted plants indoors and keep outdoor plants and
trees protected.
Pets: Bring all pets indoors. Pets and other animals that have to be
kept outdoors should have an enclosed shelter.
Pipes: Make sure all external water pipes are insulated. Keep an
interior faucet running at a drip to prevent ice buildup.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 335 AM PST Fri Jan 5 2024

A weak frontal boundary is approaching the Bay Area, bringing
light rain showers to the East Bay as well as MVFR cigs across
Bay Area terminals ahead of its passage. The North Bay is staying
relatively dry thanks to breezy N/NE winds, however there`s still
potential for KSTS to see IFR conditions later this morning
behind the cold front, but confidence is low. MVFR cigs will
persist across Bay Area terminals through mid morning. As surface
high pressure builds in across the Pacific NW/Great Basin, drier
NE wind regime will bring drier conditions to help scatter out
cigs later this morning. This drier air will also mean it will
take longer for cigs to redevelop Sat morning, but thinking is
that MVFR cigs will still return early Sat morning ahead of the
next incoming frontal system.

Vicinity of SFO...Light showers are moving through but precip is
not making it to the surface. MVFR cigs will continue through 17z
before scattering out thanks to an increase in northerly winds
behind the cold front that is expected to occur later this
morning/early afternoon. Winds will be generally light out of the
N/NE before the sea breeze influence kicks in this afternoon,
turning winds NW through the evening. Low confidence that MVFR
cigs return tomorrow, but if they do they will take longer to
develop in the early morning hours Saturday thanks to drier NE
flow.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...VFR currently with light drainage winds.
MVFR cigs may return later this morning as the frontal boundary
gets closer, but confidence is low and tempo added for the
possibility that model guidance continues to hint at between 15z
and 18z. Winds shift onshore this afternoon before turning SE
again this evening.

.MARINE...
(Today through Wednesday)
Issued at 335 AM PST Fri Jan 5 2024

A long period northwest swell will move through the coastal waters
early this morning and build through the day, resulting in
elevated and hazardous seas that will be dangerous for small craft
vessels. As swell diminishes, stronger northwest winds and
possible gale force gusts will develop over the weekend as
another Pacific weather system moves through the region.
