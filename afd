.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 435 AM PDT Sun Sep 10 2023

A few showers remain draped over southernmost Monterey County
while stratus and fog redevelop along the coast and extend locally
inland on onshore winds. Showers diminishing over southern Monterey
County this morning otherwise dry today. Dry and warm conditions
continue to prevail through early week, cooler conditions Tuesday
through late week.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 439 AM PDT Sun Sep 10 2023

The mean tropospheric wind flow well northeast and far removed
from steadily decaying tropical cyclone Jova (located 900 miles
southwest of Monterey, CA, per NHC Jova`s 2 am PDT coordinates
were 24.0N and 126.9W) transported a greater envelope of higher
precipitable water originally associated with Jova as far northeast
as the CA Central Coast since Saturday afternoon. A few showers
continue to show up on KMUX radar at this early hour over southern
Monterey County. Mesoscale models forecast steadily decreasing mid
level instability over the south through daybreak and the rest of
today thereby corresponding to dry weather today, decreasing shower
chances south.

Coastal stratus and fog continue to develop along the coastline
this morning with an inland extension across the San Francisco Bay,
including reaching the North Bay and South Bay. Also to the south
stratus and fog are reaching into the Salinas Valley. Will closely
monitor for patchy dense fog development as well this morning.

Stratus and fog clearing to the beaches later this morning, mainly
clear inland. Daytime highs today reaching the upper 60s, 70s along
the coast, 70s to lower 80s bayside to the 80s and lower 90s farther
inland. Lows tonight cooling to the 50s except 60s at elevation in
the hills/mountains in the lower level temperature inversion.

.LONG TERM...
(Monday through Saturday)
Issued at 439 AM PDT Sun Sep 10 2023

Monday`s high temperatures forecast is not much different from
today`s high temperatures forecast, hottest inland, coolest at the
coast and bays. Increasing northwest winds over the coastal waters
develop and the NAM shows an onshore pressure gradient SFO-SAC is
forecast to reach ~ 4 mb Monday afternoon, should result in at least
breezy onshore winds filtering across the bays. Coastal stratus and
fog redevelopment mixing out by late Monday morning.

There`s good global model agreement showing the subtropical 500 mb
high pressure system center over southern AZ & NM and northern Mexico
moving southward and slowly weakening through this week. ECMWF layer
humidity and wind forecasts show increasing mid-latitude influence over
our forecast area this week, bringing drier air and slightly weakening
500 mb geopotential heights along with weak cyclonic curvature (though
still seeing lower to mid level thermal ridging). By late this week
anti-cyclonic curvature (geopotential height ridging) returns at the
500 mb level. Dry weather prevailing through the week with a slight
downturn in temperatures beginning Tuesday, then not quite advertised
yet in the grids there may be a slight uptrend in temperatures later
on in the week.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 442 AM PDT Sun Sep 10 2023

More stratus coverage being observed this morning compared to
yesterday morning with low clouds making its way further inland,
filling in over the Santa Clara Valley. IFR to local LIFR
conditions continue through 16-18z this morning. Some patchy fog
has also developed over KAPC/KSNS. VFR expected today with breezy
NW winds this afternoon. Stronger northerly 925 mb winds will
develop parallel to the coastline late tonight into Sun morning,
which will bring localized LLWS concerns to KSTS. Increased north
winds aloft will make it harder for low clouds to form overnight
tomorrow for North Bay and potentially Bay Area terminals.

Vicinity of SFO...Low clouds starting to fill in from all
directions. TEMPO included for IFR cigs through 16z. NW winds will
increase this afternoon with sustained winds peaking around 20
knots. Moderate confidence that SFO will remain VFR overnight
tonight into Sunday with stronger northerly gradient helping to
keep things drier.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...LIFR cigs continue through the morning. Low
clouds will dissipate by 17-18z and will return by 03-04z this
evening. Breezy NW winds this afternoon.

.MARINE...
(Today through Friday)
Issued at 314 AM PDT Sun Sep 10 2023

Moderate to fresh northwest winds persist through midweek next
week. Gustier winds will redevelop this afternoon along coastal
jets. Stronger gusts will spread to the outer waters by early to
midweek next week. Southerly swell that originated from Hurricane
Jova will slowly diminish through the week while wind wave
heights will gradually increase.

&&

.BEACHES...
Issued at 442 AM PDT Sun Sep 10 2023

Larger southerly swell of 3 to 4 feet at 13 to 14 seconds is
being observed across the coastal waters. This swell originated
from now Tropical Storm Jova and will continue to bring an
increased risk of dangerous rip currents as well as elevated surf,
particularly for south facing beaches through this evening.
Largest breaking waves of 4 to 8 feet are most likely where south
facing beaches have a steeper slope. As a result, a Beach Hazards
Statement remains in effect for the Monterey Bay and Big Sur
coasts through this evening.

.MTR WATCHES/WARNINGS/ADVISORIES...
CA...Beach Hazards Statement through this evening for CAZ529-530.
