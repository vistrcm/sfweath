system to bring rain will arrive today and Saturday, bringing
gusty winds and periods of moderate to heavy rains. There is also
a slight chance of thunderstorms to the region, mainly tonight and
Saturday. High surf will impact the region today and Saturday,
with more coastal flooding possible. Unsettled weather will

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 237 AM PST Fri Dec 29 2023

Key Messages:

* Coastal Flood Advisory for the coastal North Bay to the Big Sur
  Coast until 2 PM today due to sea water inundation from high
  tide and large waves and the incoming storm.
* High Surf Advisory for the coastal North Bay to the Big Sur
  Coast until 6 PM today due to breaking waves up to 15-19 feet.
* Stay out of the water, and off of jetties, piers, and rocks!
* Next rain system arrives today into Saturday, rain totals of
  2-3" with isolated 5" in the coastal ranges and 0.5-1.5" inland.
* Wind Advisory in effect for widespread strong southerly winds
  today with gusts generally to 20-30 mph, up to 40-50 mph along
  the coast and at ridgetops.
* Active pattern continues for the first week of the new year.

Combined low pressure system and warm air advection approaching
from the west through southwest will bring rain and strong, gusty
winds to the forecast area today into tonight. As the system moves
eastward tonight rain rates will steadily decrease with lingering
showers persisting in a post cool frontal environment.

High surf conditions ease to advisory criteria today then leap
back upward to near high surf warning criteria since longer period
swell near 18 seconds will be arriving tonight. Current high surf
warning will be replaced at 3 am with a high surf advisory until 6
pm today.

.LONG TERM...
(Saturday through Thursday)
Issued at 237 AM PST Fri Dec 29 2023

A dry weather break develops later Saturday. Then another upstream
low pressure system reaches mainly the Big Sur Coast and southern
California with rain over the New Years holiday weekend, best chances
of measurable rain mainly well to our south. Later Monday into Tuesday
another dry break returns to the forecast area. Tuesday night and
Wednesday a low pressure system brings another chance of rain the
our forecast area. Another low may bring even more rain by late
next week.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 406 AM PST Fri Dec 29 2023

A mix of VFR, MVFR, IFR, and LIFR across the region. Nighttime
fog satellite imagery is currently showing LIFR conditions funneling
into Monterey Bay, which is expected to remain until sunrise. North
Bay has been experiencing IFR visibility, therefore tempo was placed
in TAFs until 16Z, as there is a chance for a return of lower
visibility. Expect occasional light showers until late morning
where the heavier rain band is expected to pass through the
region. This will keep conditions bouncing between VFR, MVFR and
IFR through the TAF period with conditions becoming MVFR or IFR
as the rain band moves over the terminal. Southerly winds will
become breezy and gusty late morning/early afternoon but will
return to light to moderate by tonight.

Vicinity of SFO...VFR with few low clouds over the terminal. Expect
some occasional light vicinity showers until the early afternoon
where heavier rain band will cause MVFR conditions through the
TAF period. Few models suggest period of VFR through the TAF
period after the afternoon, but had low confidence to include at
this moment. Southerly winds are expected to become breezy with
gust up to 30 knots in the afternoon. Models suggest winds may
reach close to AWW criteria, but had low to moderate confidence to
include in TAF, but will monitor if any changes is needed.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...LIFR conditions at both terminals with
uncertainty conditions improving, but expect near 16-18Z, where
mixing will occur and MVFR conditions will prevail as the storm
moves closer to the terminals. Southerly winds are expected to
become breezy and gusty between 23-25 knots in the afternoon and
will return to moderate in the evening.

.MARINE...
(Today through Wednesday)
Issued at 406 AM PST Fri Dec 29 2023

The low pressure system in the Eastern Pacific will continue to
move closer to the coast and will divert northward before
reaching the coast. A large swell bringing 13-21 foot waves
continues to impact our waters Friday into Saturday. The storm
will also bring strong to gale force southerly winds to the
coastal zones on Friday as well as a slight chance of
thunderstorms over the coastal waters Friday afternoon through
Saturday morning. Waters become calmer towards the beginning of
the work week.

.BEACHES...
Issued at 725 PM PST Thu Dec 28 2023

A Coastal Flood Advisory is in effect through 2 PM Friday. Large
breaking waves and high tides will continue to contribute to
flooding of areas near the coast.

A High Surf Warning is in effect through 3 AM PST Friday. Expect
hazardous wave conditions with breaking waves 28 to 33 feet and
localized beach erosion. Large waves can sweep across the beach
without warning, pulling people into the sea from rocks, jetties
and beaches. These large waves can be erratic and unpredictable.
The larger swings of the tidal cycle will contribute to the beach
risks.

Remain out of the water during the High Surf to avoid hazardous
swimming conditions. Use extra caution near the surf zone as
these large waves will be capable of sweeping people into the
water. Avoid rocks and jetties. Avoid steep beaches. Stay much
farther back from the water and never turn your back on the ocean.
