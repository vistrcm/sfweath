...New AVIATION, MARINE...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 100 AM PST Sun Dec 24 2023

Generally dry conditions with temperatures at or slightly above the
seasonal average through Christmas. An active pattern starts
bringing rain to the area late on Tuesday and continues into the New
Year.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 100 AM PST Sun Dec 24 2023

Patches of fog and low stratus have developed across the North Bay
and portions of interior Monterey County. Expect some further fog
development across the rest of the night, although high clouds over
the region may impact how extensive fog development becomes. Morning
lows will drop into the mid 30s to lower 40s in the interior
valleys, with the coastal regions seeing lows in the mid to upper
40s. High astronomical tides and a northwest swell will create minor
coastal flooding in the San Francisco Bayshore, so a Coastal Flood
Advisory is in effect this morning for the coasts of the San
Francisco Bay and the Bayshore side of the North Bay. High tide at
San Francisco today will come at 846 AM and expected astronomical
tide is at 6.7 feet.

Today should see a generally quiescent weather pattern under the
influence of an upper level ridge, with light winds and no
precipitation expected for the day. High temperatures are somewhat
cooler than those seen yesterday, with the lower elevations seeing
upper 50s to lower 60s while higher elevations go into the low to
mid 50s. For those of you with outdoor plans on Christmas morning,
morning lows will generally vary from the mid 30s to lower 40s in
the interior valleys, with a couple spots of low 30s in the far
interior areas, with the coastal and Bayshore regions seeing lows in
the 40s. As of now, not expecting any widespread frosts to develop
outside of the highest mountain ranges.

.LONG TERM...
(Monday through Saturday)
Issued at 100 AM PST Sun Dec 24 2023

Christmas Day itself (AKA Monday) should generally be a pleasant day
with high temperatures generally in the upper 50s to mid 60s,
perhaps down to the low to mid 50s in the higher elevations. A Beach
Hazards Statement is out for high breaking waves; more information
is available in the Beaches section below. An upper level low from
the north Pacific will eat into the upper level ridge, with the
coastal North Bay possibly seeing a few sprinkles late on Christmas
Day and the day after (probabilities up to 20-40%) but the first
notable system comes in late on Tuesday with a peak on Wednesday,
with rain totals up to 1-2" across the North Bay, perhaps up to 2.5"
in the coastal ranges. Elsewhere, rain totals have shown a
decreasing trend, with the coastal Bay Area seeing rain totals from
0.5-0.75", the interior Bay seeing 0.1-0.5", and the Central coast
seeing up to 0.25-0.5" closer to the coast and a few sprinkles
inland. Winds will be particularly breezy on Tuesday, especially
near the coast and atop the coastal ranges.

Attention then shifts to a new system expected to come in late
Thursday into Friday. Rain totals are still being refined, but early
indications indicate that significant rainfall may be more
widespread with this system, especially south of the North Bay.
Beyond that ensemble guidance continues to show a series of upper
level troughs heading into the western United States into the first
week of the new year, with an active pattern possible well into the
middle of January. As always, it`s still a good idea to make sure
gutters and storm drains are clean and to follow forecast updates
from a trusted source.
