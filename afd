.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 205 AM PDT Tue Aug 15 2023

Warm temperatures and a moderate HeatRisk will persist inland
through mid week. Cooler temperatures are expected for late week
into the weekend. Lingering upper moisture suggests an isolated
shower or storm remains possible, but most of the area should
remain dry.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 205 AM PDT Tue Aug 15 2023

Currently the high pressure system over the Pacific Northwest is
dominating the low pressure over the ocean, which is supporting the
warming trend for today. Therefore, the biggest weather concerns for
today will be the heat as the maximum temperatures will be in the
mid 90s to low 100s across the interior and mid to high 70s along
the coast. Temperatures tonight will also follow a warmer trend
compared to last night with temperatures reaching a few degrees
higher in some areas. Interior areas will experience minimums of mid
to high 60s, as the coast will see mid to high 50s. Although
temperatures are trending on the warmer side, HeatRisk still remains
moderate as onshore flow and sufficient minimum overnight
temperatures will help keep conditions cool. Potential patchy fog is
possible for areas near the coastline during the early
morning/overnight hours.

Although global models show drier conditions moving over our region
today, slight chance (10% or less) for convection were added into
the forecast over the Diablo Range, as some of the favorable factors
for convection of orographic lift, hot temperatures, and instability
are present.

.LONG TERM...
(Wednesday through Monday)
Issued at 205 AM PDT Tue Aug 15 2023

The Bay Area will remain along the eastern periphery of a closed
upper low through mid week. Thereafter the low should devolve to an
open-wave trough as an upstream perturbation enters the Pacific
Northwest. West coast troughing will persist into next week, as a
tropical cyclone or its remnants bring rich moisture into northern
Baja and portions of the Desert Southwest. Seasonally warm
temperatures will prevail for inland areas through Thursday, with
highs in the 95-100 degree range. Gradual cooling is expected
thereafter given the troughing pattern, deepening marine layer, and
stronger onshore flow. There is a small chance (5-10 percent) for an
isolated shower or thunderstorm along the Diablo range on Wednesday,
but this potential is below mentionable levels in the official
forecast. Otherwise dry mid-level air wrapping around the southeast
portion of the upper low should be a limiting factor for convective
development through at least Friday. While a troughing pattern is
expected into next week, differences in its expected evolution are
evident among the deterministic guidance beginning this weekend.
This is also reflected in WPC ensemble clusters, which suggest
uncertainty in the amplitude of the upper trough. At the very least
we may see some increase in mid to upper level clouds with a slight
uptick in moisture aloft.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 441 AM PDT Tue Aug 15 2023

A mix of VFR and LIFR as Monterey Bay is socked in with fog and low
ceilings. Expect VFR conditions for terminals north of Monterey Bay
to remain through the the TAF period except KOAK, where models
suggest IFR ceilings after midnight tonight. Any terminals
experiencing conditions lower than VFR will clear by 16-17Z today.
Higher confidence that inland terminals remaining VFR, compared to
North Bay terminals, as some models suggest IFR ceilings for
tonight. Onshore winds will become moderate to breezy in the
afternoon with a return of light to moderate tonight.

Vicinity of SFO...VFR. Slight chance for IFR ceilings late
tonight/early tomorrow morning, but had low confidence to include in
the TAFs. Otherwise, expect VFR through TAF period with onshore
breezy winds up to 14 knots this afternoon with a return of
moderate speed tonight.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...LIFR as satellite shows fog up to 1/2SM for
both terminals. Expect condition to improve near 16Z to VFR with a
return of IFR ceilings tonight, with possible chances of LIFR
conditions again late tonight/early tomorrow morning. Onshore winds
will become moderate/slightly breezy this afternoon then becoming
light again tonight.

.MARINE...
(Today through Sunday)
Issued at 441 AM PDT Tue Aug 15 2023

Light winds across the coastal waters and breezy afternoon and
evening winds across the San Francisco Bay to the Delta. Moderate
period southerly swell continues through the week with a shorter
period northwesterly swell. New northwest swell arrives mid to
late week.
