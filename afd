.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 1219 AM PDT Sat Oct 21 2023

Saturday will be cool with increasing cloud cover before an
approaching cold front brings rain Sunday. Most areas are expected
to receive 1/10"-1/4". The frontal passage will bring clearer
skies and a moderate NW breeze Monday. Temperatures will be near
normal for the remainder of the week.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 1219 AM PDT Sat Oct 21 2023

The radar is picking up on an early bird rain band about 50 miles
offshore. There is a decent chance that this brings measurable
precipitation to coastal areas later this morning. It`s currently
drifting east at less than 10 mph, so if any light precip makes it
to the coast, it will arrive anytime between sunrise and noon.

Cloud cover is increasing overnight after a wedge of dry air
cleared the skies Fri evening. This trend will continue through
the weekend. Temperatures are expected to be cooler than average
Sat with most areas only reaching the upper 60s or low 70s.

While there is a small chance for light rain from the band
offshore this morning, the more significant precipitation is
expected to hold off until around midnight in the North Bay and
around sunrise on Sunday morning in the Monterey Bay area.

.LONG TERM...
(Sunday through Friday)
Issued at 1219 AM PDT Sat Oct 21 2023

The confidence in the Sunday rain forecast is growing, with both
the probability of precipitation and expected accumulation amounts
increasing with the latest forecast. The North Bay and San
Francisco Peninsula now have an 80-90% chance of rain, with the
East Bay and Monterey Bay areas in the 60-80% range. Storm total
accumulations have grown to 0.25-0.5" in the North Bay, and
0.1"-0.25" in the East Bay and Monterey Bay areas. Locally higher
amounts are possible in coastal mountains. This looks to be a
mostly beneficial event, with rain spread out through the day and
no significant flooding threat. One remaining unknown is
thunderstorm potential. The official forecast is still holding
off on mentioning a chance of thunderstorms, but we are close to
that threshold for the North Bay. The best chance for this is
around the early afternoon. If the surface temperature can reach
around 70 degrees, the surface based instability is there to
support some thunderstorm development. Getting that warm will be
a challenge with the dense cloud cover. If any strong showers or
thunderstorms do develop, localized accumulations up to an inch
are likely with high rainfall rates.

Monday will be dry with clearing skies. Building high pressure
will enhance the gradient behind the cold front and support a
moderate NW breeze, with stronger winds along the coast. As the
high pressure continues to approach the coast, the marine layer
will gradually compress. The remainder of the week looks pretty
standard with no significant precipitation expected, temperatures
near normal, and marine layer stratus in the usual coastal areas
and valleys.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 437 AM PDT Sat Oct 21 2023

An elevated lower level cool front (vicinity 925 mb, ~2500 feet)
capped by thermal ridging from 850 mb to 500 mb continues to advance
toward and over the Bay Area; clouds (water vapor molecularly lighter
than dry air) are vertically mixing into much drier air aloft eroding
the leading edge of low clouds. Even lengthening night-time cooling
hours is having trouble forming low clouds at this hour. The lower
level cool front is forecast to advance eastward across the entire
forecast area this morning, the steadily increasing depth of the
marine layer supporting MVFR ceilings however initially along the
immediate coastline areas of IFR may develop (until the marine
layer depth supports MVFR ceilings all inclusive). MVFR to VFR
forecast today since lower level cool air advection strongest
vicinity 925 mb continues before returning to neutral or weak warm
air advection later today.

Vicinity of SFO...VFR continues, still may see MVFR low cloud
ceiling this morning, otherwise lifting to VFR by late morning.
Southeast wind this morning, shifting to southwest to west southwest
today.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO

Monterey Bay Terminals...Currently VFR due to sufficiently dry
air mixing in with the marine layer. The lower level cool front
nearest the Bay Area will also affect the Monterey Bay terminals
with steadily developing MVFR ceilings, lifting to VFR by late
this morning. Light southeasterly winds shifting to onshore near
10 knots by late this morning and early afternoon.

.MARINE...
(Today through Thursday)
Issued at 402 AM PDT Sat Oct 21 2023

A low pressure system over the eastern Pacific will bring a chance
of light rain to the coastal waters and bays this weekend. Beginning
late Sunday and Monday winds will shift to northwesterly, strongest
winds over the northern waters early to mid next week.
