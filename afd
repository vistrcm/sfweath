.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 352 AM PDT Thu Jul 18 2024

Warmer temperatures continue to climb today and tomorrow, with a
weekend pause before even warmer temperatures returning for the
beginning of next week, peaking through the middle of next week. A

A Heat Advisory will begin at 10 AM this morning for interior
portions of the North Bay, East Bay, South Bay and interior
portions of Monterey and San Benito counties, with the advisory
expiring at 11 PM tomorrow night.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 352 AM PDT Thu Jul 18 2024

Gradual H50 height increases across our area today and tomorrow will
help lift temperatures into the 90s and low 100s for many of our
inland locations, with some of the typically hot elevated spots
approaching 110 by tomorrow afternoon in southern Monterey and San
Benito counties. A Heat Advisory will begin later this morning at 10
AM and persist through 11 PM tomorrow night for interior portions of
the North Bay, East Bay, South Bay and interior portions of Monterey
and San Benito counties. The marine boundary layer continues to
compress and will help keep highs in the 60s and 70s for our areas
under the coastal influence the next couple of days. Low level
stratus, patchy fog and light drizzle at times will return each
evening and fill in the typical gaps and valleys each night, and
retreat by early afternoon.

&&

.LONG TERM...
(Friday through Wednesday)
Issued at 352 AM PDT Thu Jul 18 2024

As a dome of high pressure centered over the Four Corners exerts its
influence over our area the next couple of days, a weak disturbance
over the southeast Pacific waters will begin to take shape and
slowly move north up the California coast, arriving at our latitude
by Saturday afternoon. The weak upper low/trough will interrupt the
building heat for the weekend as temperatures return to right around
normal for Saturday and Sunday. The ridge to our east and persistent
troughing to our north battle for position over central California
for the beginning of next week. Ultimately a more compressed ridge
expands west over our area by late Monday, deflecting the troughing
farther north. High temperatures inland on Monday will jump 5-10
degrees from Sundays highs, with Tuesday and Wednesday looking like
the hottest days of the week. Another weak disturbance from open
waters over the southeast Pacific arrives late Thursday/early Friday
and should help to drop temperatures back down close to seasonal
averages.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 413 AM PDT Thu Jul 18 2024

Currently a mix of LIFR-VFR at the terminals. Confidence in the
ceiling department has plummeted as stratus has really been holding
steady and not really shown any signs of expanding this morning,
uncertainty lies primarily in APC, SFO, and SJC. Widespread VFR to
prevail by late-morning. Winds will remain onshore through the TAF
period.

Vicinity of SFO...Currently VFR with northwesterly flow. Confidence
has only declined on whether or not the terminal will receive a
ceiling. If a ceiling does develop, high confidence that it will be
IFR and that VFR will prevail by late-morning. Winds will prevail
out of the west/northwest through the TAF period with gusts up to
30 knots to be expected this afternoon and evening.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...Currently LIFR with westerly flow at both
terminals. VFR to prevail by late-morning with an early return of
ceilings tonight. Winds will prevail out of the west/northwest
through the TAF period.

.MARINE...
(Today through Tuesday)
Issued at 413 AM PDT Thu Jul 18 2024

High pressure over the Eastern Pacific Ocean will be the
dominating feature through the forecast period. As the pressure
gradient tightens, northwesterly breezes will become strong with
near gale force gusts. Gale force gusts are to be expected over
the northern waters. Significant wave heights in the outer waters
will build to 10 to 15 ft by Sunday and persist through the end of
the forecast period.
