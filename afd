.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 1244 AM PDT Sat Jun 7 2025

Generally stable conditions through the middle of next week with
seasonally warm temperatures inland, cooler temperatures along the
coast, and morning clouds throughout the coast and the inland
valleys. A cooling trend arrives for the end of next week.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 1244 AM PDT Sat Jun 7 2025

The general weather situation remains remarkably stable today, with
an upper level ridge to our north and a weak closed low off the
California coast. Satellite imagery is showing stratus across the
coast, building inland across the Sonoma County valleys, the Bayside
East Bay, and the northern Salinas Valley. Expect the stratus to
continue building inland through the morning hours, with the inland
areas clearing out by the afternoon while low clouds linger at the
immediate coast. Today`s forecast high temperatures are generally
similar to yesterday`s, with highs in the lower to middle 80s in the
interior valleys, as high as the middle 90s in the southern reaches
of Monterey County, around the upper 60s to the upper 70s in the
Bayshore, and the lower to middle 60s along the Pacific coast. An
onshore breeze is expected this afternoon and evening with gusts of
20-30 mph through the gaps, passes, and the northern Salinas
Valley.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 428 AM PDT Sat Jun 7 2025

The marine layer has compressed to around 1,000 feet according to
the Bodega Bay profiler, bringing somewhat lower ceilings this
morning than we`ve seen over the last couple days. A mixture of
LIFR/IFR/MVFR ceilings are currently observed, with a slight
chance for visibility restrictions in the North Bay and along the
immediate coast. The stratus will erode late morning before
returning this evening, with similar ceiling heights expected.
Moderate winds are expected this afternoon at most sites. Similar
stratus coverage and timing is expected over the next couple
days.

Vicinity of SFO...MVFR ceilings have arrived at SFO, and there is
a good chance that they will lower into the IFR category over the
next hour or two. Clear skies and moderate onshore winds will
dominate from late morning through the evening before stratus
returns overnight.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...Celings are around 900 feet at both MRY
and SNS, and may drop to 700 before the sun comes up. The Pt. Sur
profiler suggests the marine layer is a little deeper for the
southern terminals, at roughly 1,500 feet. This should help keep
the visibility clear, though some guidance disputes this. The
clearing today will last for roughly 6 hours or so in the middle
of the day before low clouds start to roll back in this evening.

.MARINE...
(Today through Thursday)
Issued at 428 AM PDT Sat Jun 7 2025

Buoys are reporting gentle winds across the coastal waters this
morning with moderate sea heights. A westerly breeze will pick-up
this afternoon, enhanced by diurnal effects along the coast and in
the Bays. A low amplitude, long period southwesterly swell
arrives Monday and will causing waves to break in deeper water.
Significant wave heights will remain moderate until a strong NW
breeze and rough seas arrive mid-week.

&&

.MTR WATCHES/WARNINGS/ADVISORIES...
CA...None.
PZ...Small Craft Advisory from 3 PM this afternoon to 9 PM PDT this
     evening for SF Bay N of Bay Bridge.

     Small Craft Advisory from 3 PM to 9 PM PDT Sunday for Pt Pinos
     to Pt Piedras Blancas 0-10 nm.
