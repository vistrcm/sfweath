...New UPDATE...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 1200 AM PST Mon Feb 19 2024

Periods of moderate to heavy rain today with gusty winds.
Thunderstorm chances increasing this afternoon into early
evening. Impacts from rain, wind, and thunderstorms are
anticipated. Showers linger into mid week before dry conditions
return. Rain returns next weekend.

.UPDATE...
Issued at 815 AM PST Mon Feb 19 2024

Another gorgeous morning for most as much of the large scale
forcing has moved out of the area with main front now situated
along the Central Valley and down through the Central Coast. Moist
upslope flow continues throughout the day as the low remains
spinning offshore, so locations like the Santa Cruz Mtns will
continue to see periods of light rain throughout the day. With the
clearing this morning, this will aid in further destabilizing the
atmosphere as the surface warms and the air aloft continues to
cool. Forecast surface based CAPE on the order of ~500 J/Kg and
effective bulk shear 30-40 kts for areas mainly north of the
Monterey Bay will be more than enough for a few thunderstorms to
initiate and sustain themselves as they move inland off the
waters. As of writing, isolated cells moving through the waters
off the North Bay coast have been showing consistent signs of
rotation. Would not be surprised to see a waterspout or two today
along the coast with a marginal chance for a very brief tornado
threat to land, particularly from Monterey Bay northward and
inland areas from about Livermore through Napa County. This low
threat of a brief tornado decreases as we lose surface heating
heading into the evening and the vertical wind field becomes more
uniform. A brief wind threat is also possible from these storms
as well. Given steep low level lapse rates allowing for efficient
vertical mixing, a brief gust or two of up to 60 mph appears
plausible from any of the stronger cells.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and Tonight)
Issued at 1200 AM PST Mon Feb 19 2024

SW-NE oriented rain bands have been persistent across the North
Bay and the Santa Cruz Mtns/Santa Clara Valley/East Bay regions
as the surface triple point (intersection of occluded, warm, and
cold fronts) continues to approach the Bay Area. Flood Advisories
continue for much of the area with minor impacts ongoing. More
rises on creeks/streams are being observed as well as increased
reports of roadway flooding early this morning.

Looking ahead...High resolution guidance has been consistently
hinting at the potential for a heavy/convective rain band setting
up across the Bay Area later this morning. There is still
uncertainty on if/where this narrow feature will set up and if it
will stall. Upper level support will be favorable for large scale
ascent through the afternoon, drawing in all that subtropical
moisture (PWATs of around 1"). If convective bands were to train
and stall for many hours today, this could result in more serious
flooding impacts. We`ll be watching this closely through the
morning. Chance for thunderstorms still look decent through early
this vening, especially for the North Bay and the interior East
Bay bordering the Sac Valley. A few stronger storms are likely,
with gusty winds, hail, and perhaps a brief tornado. Continue to
be weather aware today and have many ways to receive weather
alerts.

.LONG TERM...
(Tuesday through next Saturday)
Issued at 1200 AM PST Mon Feb 19 2024

No changes to the extended forecast and the previous discussion is
below.

PREV DISCUSSION...
Issued at 122 PM PST Sun Feb 18 2024

By Tuesday, the upper level jet supporting the system continues to
move southeast, placing our storm in the left entrance convergent
quadrant of the jet, hinting towards large scale subsidence,
unfavorable for any further support of the storm. The surface low
gradually meanders northward while weakening, and we will hold on
to much weaker scattered showers into early Wednesday morning.
Beyond that, the forecast dries out for the latter half of the
week.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 412 AM PST Mon Feb 19 2024

The cold front from the associated atmospheric river has already
moved through the region; however, there are still many hazards at
play through the TAF period as the parent low continues to swirl off
the coast. While below the low-level wind shear threshold to include
in the TAFs, it is still very likely to be bumpy getting out of
the area today. The majority of the remaining precipitation to be
seen today is likely to be convective in nature, generally
decreasing in coverage and intensity from north to south.
Thunderstorms are possible, although confidence was too low to
explicitly include in the TAFs. Because of this convective nature,
ceilings and visibilities look to remain VFR otherwise, with the
exception of STS. Widespread gusty southerly winds of 25 to 35
knots are to be expected at all terminals. Rain and wind will
begin to taper off towards the end of the TAF period.

Vicinity of SFO...Currently VFR with gusty southerly winds.
Southerly winds will continue to be on the increase throughout the
day. Rain showers will likely impact the terminal by this afternoon,
briefly reducing visibility and the ceiling. Rain and wind begin to
diminish into this evening.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...Currently VFR with breezy southerly flow at
both terminals. Southerly winds will continue to be on the increase
throughout the day. Best chance for rain showers is this afternoon.

.MARINE...
(Today through Saturday)
Issued at 412 AM PST Mon Feb 19 2024

A strong frontal boundary extending across the California coastal
waters continues to bring rain and strong southerly winds. Expect
rain, the chance for thunderstorms, and gale force gusts to
persist through today. A new moderate period westerly swell will
build in today, resulting in elevated seas of 15 to 20 feet. This
swell will start to diminish late tonight; however, significant
wave heights of 12 to 16 feet are to be expected through Tuesday.
Post-frontal rain showers will be present on Tuesday with a
return to fair and calm weather by Wednesday.

&&

.BEACHES...
Issued at 1000 AM PST Sat Feb 17 2024

A high surf advisory is in effect through 4 AM Tuesday.

Incoming large westerly is causing large breaking waves of 18 to
22 feet along exposed, west- facing beaches. Locally higher waves
of 28 feet are possible along some favored areas with steep
beaches. In addition to the westerly swell, strong southerly winds
will enhance the energy in the surf zone, creating dangerous
conditions for surfers and swimmers. Inexperienced swimmer should
remain out of the water. All beachgoers are strongly encouraged to
respect the power of the ocean and reminded to never turn their
back to the water. Large waves can sweep across the beach without
warning, pulling people into the sea from rocks, jetties, and
beaches. These waves can also move large objects such as logs,
crushing anyone caught underneath.
