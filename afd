...New UPDATE, MARINE...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 1205 AM PST Sun Mar 3 2024

A post-frontal trough will support scattered showers through
Sunday. Cold overnight temperatures are expected through Monday
morning. Another weather system will bring lighter, mostly
beneficial rain from Monday through Wednesday. Warmer and drier
weather finally returns late week.

.UPDATE...
Issued at 852 AM PST Sun Mar 3 2024

Isolated to scattered rain showers prevail this morning and are
likely to continue at times throughout the day. Snow levels are
around 2500 ft in the North Bay to around 3500 ft across the Central
Coast. Thus, snow showers remain possible at elevations above these
values. No major updates planed this morning.

&&

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 1205 AM PST Sun Mar 3 2024

Shower activity is decreasing overnight. This drying trend will
continue through the day Sunday. Temperatures will be well below
normal this morning. The 1000-500 mb thickness ranges between 535
dam and 540 dam across the North Bay, indicating patchy frost may
develop. This will be more likely if the cloud cover decreases to
allow additional radiational cooling before the sun comes up.
Gentle westerly winds in the morning will increase to a moderate
breeze by the afternoon.

&&

.LONG TERM...
(Monday through Saturday)
Issued at 1205 AM PST Sun Mar 3 2024

The break in rain will be short lived. A new low pressure system
is expected to form off the coast of far northern California on
Monday and will move over the Bay Area by Wednesday. Rain chances
return to the North Bay Monday afternoon and will push through
the rest of the Bay Area and Central Coast through Wednesday
morning. There`s a slight chance of thunderstorms Wednesday as the
low comes ashore. Winds will shift from moderate to strong
southerlies on Tuesday to northerlies on Wednesday.

By Thursday, the low will have weakened and moved farther inland
allowing high pressure to build over the Bay Area. This will bring
the return of dry weather and allow the afternoon temperatures to
finally return to near normal with highs in the mid-60s expected
from Thu-Sat. Thu and Fri will also be mostly clear, before cloud
cover starts to increase over the weekend.
