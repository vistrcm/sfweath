.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 1215 AM PST Sat Jan 13 2024

Upper level moisture is evident via moisture channel imagery early
this morning off the Oregon coast. This moisture is occuring in
association with a shortwave trough. An attendant surface low was
noted via surface analysis well offshore with its associated warm
front draped across southern Oregon. Light to moderate precipitation
was ongoing across northwest CA within a warm advection regime. A
few stray showers made it down to the Bay Area with only trace
rainfall amounts.

Expect the surface low to landfall over central OR today with the
warm front remaining to our north. However the associated cold front
will push south into the Bay Area this afternoon as the surface low
occludes. A focused plume of moisture (precipitable water values
~1.3") will initially take aim at the North Bay before progressively
sinking south through the remainder of the Bay Area and Central
Coast later today into tonight. This should keep the greatest rain
totals across the North Bay but with still respectable amounts
anticipated for the Bay Area. Amounts will be waning for the Central
Coast, particularly for inland areas. Storm totals remain steady with
little change from the previous forecast cycle. Still looking for
around 2-3 inches for the North Bay hills (with isolated locally
higher amounts), 1-1.5" in the North Bay Valleys, and 0.5-1" for
most of the remainder of the Bay Area. Exceptions will be in the
rain shadowed valleys where amounts should be 0.5" or less. Monterey
Bay and the Santa Cruz Mountains should see 0.3-0.6", with much
lesser amounts heading inland. As for timing, steadier rain should
reach the North Bay around 5 AM, The Golden Gate around 7 AM, and
the South Bay around 10 AM. Showers should then linger through the
afternoon and evening before the cold front sweeps south and dries
things during the overnight hours. Showers could linger along the
Central Coast into the first portion of Sunday. Breezy to gusty
westerly winds of 20-30 mph will accompany the rain today with some
localized gusts to around 40 mph. Temperatures will remain fairly
mild despite the cloud cover with highs in the upper 50s and lows in
the 40s.

.LONG TERM...
(Sunday through Friday)
Issued at 1215 AM PST Sat Jan 13 2024

Rain showers should linger into the first portion of Sunday before
ending. Thereafter look for quiet conditions for early week with
rain chances retuning for Wednesday. Amounts from this system look
rather light at this time. Expect a gradual warming trend through
week`s end with rain potentially returning towards the mid portion
of next week.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 402 AM PST Sat Jan 13 2024

Widespread Mid-level clouds are building with lower clouds and mist
affecting the North Bay. These lower CIGs will continue to spread
south through the day along with light prefrontal showers and
increasing southerly winds. The cold front arrives this afternoon
and early evening and spreads south. Winds become gusty ahead and
along the main rain band into the evening. Expect reduced visibility
from moderate rainfall as the front passes. Winds reduce and CIGs
lift behind the front into the late night and early Sunday morning.


Vicinity of SFO...Scattered low clouds and southerly winds last
through the morning with increased showery activity and MVFR CIGS
expected in the afternoon. Stronger southwest winds arrive this
evening peaking with 30 kt gusts. This will come along the passage
of the main rain band, which will reduce visibility from rainfall.
VFR and lighter winds return late tonight.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO

Monterey Bay Terminals...VFR with light winds last into the
afternoon. Moderate westerly winds with MVFR CIGs build into the
late afternoon. Light showers pass through in the evening with the
rain band arriving into the late night.

.MARINE...
(Today through Thursday)
Issued at 402 AM PST Sat Jan 13 2024

Breezy to gusty SW winds are arriving ahead of another cold front.
This will create hazardous conditions for small crafts. The main
rain band will spread across the waters through the day and move
from north to south. Winds will begin to weaken into Sunday with
returning weak to moderate NW winds lasting through early next
week. Drier weather returns after the frontal passage, with light
rain chances in the middle of the work week. Moderate period
northwest swell continues through the weekend, with a new and
longer period northwest swell train arriving into monday.
