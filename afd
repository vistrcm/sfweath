...New UPDATE, MARINE...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 130 AM PDT Thu Sep 12 2024

An upper level trough to our north continues to shift farther inland
with wind speeds diminishing throughout the day, yet will remain
breezy to gusty at times. Slightly warmer for Friday, near seasonal
averages. Then another trough will begin to impact the region
bringing chances of precipitation at times through next week.

&&

.UPDATE...
Issued at 905 AM PDT Thu Sep 12 2024

Forecast remains on track with no updates needed as a weak, low-
amplitude ridge begins to build into place. As a result,
temperatures today will near seasonable averages with gusty winds
still expected this afternoon and evening as the upper-level low
continues to move out of the region.

&&

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 130 AM PDT Thu Sep 12 2024

The mid/upper level trough axis will continue to shift farther
inland as higher pressure builds in from the west. This will bring
temperatures up to near seasonal averages, especially across the
North Bay and East Bay with mid-to-upper 80`s expected. Elsewhere,
afternoon maximum temperatures are expected to be in the 60`s to
70`s near the coast and up to the mid 80`s across the interior.
Today will be less windy than yesterday but afternoon and evening
gusts of 20-40mph (locally stronger in the favored windy spots).

Tonight, again northwest facing slops will be favored for low clouds
as northwest flow continues over the Pacific in response to the
exiting trough. Temperatures will cool into the low-to-mid 50`s,
upper 50`s in the Santa Clara Valley, and up to the mid-to-upper
60`s in the higher terrain.

.LONG TERM...
(Friday through Wednesday)
Issued at 130 AM PDT Thu Sep 12 2024

Friday will be the warmest day of the week region-wide as the
aforementioned high pressure builds inland. However, it will be short
lived as troughing returns to the West Coast and cools temperatures
aloft on Sunday. As the trough digs southward, it will bring rain
chances to the region Sunday afternoon and into Monday. However,
rainfall amounts still remain in question and forecast models
diverge on the timing and placement of the through. One thing we
have higher confidence on is that a cool down will take place! This
unsettled pattern will persist into next week as another upper level
through develops on the heels of the upper level low. Stay tuned...

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 447 AM PDT Thu Sep 12 2024

Patchy stratus continues over much of the Bay Area and Central
Coast. CIGs have been fluctuating between IFR and MVFR with CIGs
expected to predominantly be MVFR through the remainder of the
morning. Stratus coverage may temporarily transition from broken to
scattered but, overall, stratus is expected to prevail through 17-
18Z at OAK, MRY, and SNS. Stratus may temporarily impact SFO, SJC,
and LVK through 16Z after which stratus is expected to dissipate for
good with RH values expected to drop. By late morning, VFR returns
to all sites and moderate to gusty winds generally out of the west
to northwest return. Low to moderate confidence on timing of stratus
return this evening. Current thinking is that a late stratus return
around 08-09Z will take place with a slightly earlier return
expected along the Central Coast.

Vicinity of SFO...Patchy stratus continues through 16Z after which
decreasing moisture lowers confidence in stratus persisting. VFR
conditions persist through late Thursday/early Friday morning with
low to moderate confidence in stratus returning around 09Z. Moderate
west to northwest winds will strengthen and become gusty during the
afternoon/evening with gusts up to 25 knots expected before
weakening again overnight.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...Stratus and MVFR-IFR CIGs are expected to
continue through 17-18Z. Stratus has been patchy with CIGs
temporarily improving and becoming few/scattered at MRY and SNS
overnight. Moderate confidence that CIGs will persist through 17-18Z
with some potential for earlier clearing beginning around 16Z. In
particular, SNS may clear before MRY as stratus has been
consistently patchier there all night. VFR conditions persist
through the afternoon and into the evening with a mix of MVFR-IFR
expected by late evening and into the night. Light, variable winds
continue through the morning before becoming more moderate during

&&

.MARINE...
(Today through Tuesday)
Issued at 905 AM PDT Thu Sep 12 2024

The gradient between subtropical high pressure and a trough over
California is supporting a fresh to strong NW breeze with gale
force gusts in the northern outer waters. Conditions will
gradually improve through the next 48 hours and Saturday will be a
nice day on the water. A new system will increase winds and
rebuild seas on Sunday with unsettled weather possible through the
fist half of next week.
