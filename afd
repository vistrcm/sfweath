.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 349 AM PDT Sat Jun 3 2023

As a ridge aloft strengthens, the region will undergo a warming
and drying trend this weekend. Expect less inland intrusion of
late night and morning low clouds as inland highs are within a few
degrees of normal. An upper level low will move over the region
early next week causing a cool down and bringing a 10 to 20
percent chance for showers with a low chance (10 percent) for a
few thunderstorms.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 349 AM PDT Sat Jun 3 2023

With ridging aloft, the marine layer is showing signs of
compression both on satellite and on the profilers. For the Fort
Ord and Bodega Bay profilers, the marine layer has lowered to
around 1000 to 1200 ft deep compared to 2000 ft or more in prior
days. Nighttime satellite imagery paints a much different picture
than 24 hours ago. There is not nearly as much inland intrusion of
low marine stratus early this morning. The cloudiest areas are
along the SF Peninsula and continuing into Santa Cruz county and
all around the rest of the Monterey Bay region...including filling
the Salinas Valley and stratus banking up against the Big Sur
coastline. As for the rest of the Bay Area, stratus has pushed
through the Golden Gate with a couple of patches of low clouds in
the East Bay (from Richmond down thru El Cerrito, Berkeley, and
Piedmont and another patch between Castro Valley and San Ramon).
North Bay also has a couple of larger patches of stratus...one
filling into the valley of Napa County and the other from Bodega
Bay southward thru Inverness and towards Woodacre.

As the day progresses, expect fairly clear skies for most inland
areas as afternoon highs warm into the 70s and 80s with perhaps a
few readings in the low 90s for far eastern East Bay and up in
northeastern Napa county and far southern Monterey county. Coastal
areas will likely stay near seasonal to below normal as stratus
clings to coastal areas this morning and inhibits how much warming
occurs today.

.LONG TERM...
(Sunday through Friday)
Issued at 349 AM PDT Sat Jun 3 2023

Warming inland continues on Sunday with that being the warmest day
of the week. Afternoon highs will remain in the 70s and 80s with a
few 90s, but most locations should notice a nudge upward on their
thermometer readings by a few degrees on Sunday. Marine layer is
expected to remain somewhat compressed on Sunday allowing for
ample sunshine again for inland areas.

Overnight Sunday into early Monday, the synoptic pattern will
change as an upper level low forms and pushes into the CA coast.
The center of this low will be just offshore of SoCal and sub
tropical moisture will advect counter-clockwise around the low.
PWAT values are forecast to increase by the hi-res models on
Monday into Tuesday (ranging from about 0.75" to over 1"). In
addition, there are signs of some instability as surface CAPE
values climb between 100 to 300 J/kg (which is enough to trigger
brief thunderstorms). The Total Totals index also increases
between 40 to 50 over our CWA for Monday into Tuesday (again,
enough to trigger some thunderstorms). The best instability looks
to be in the Central Valley including the Sierra and in far
NorCal where there`s higher confidence in convection, but we can`t
rule it out for our forecast area. The hi-res models should give
us better insight in future model runs. As for rain totals Monday
and thru Tuesday, WPC QPF has increased since yesterday. While
most of our CWA will likely see light rain (around 0.10" or less)
localized places may see up to a third of an inch, especially if
convection does occur and allow for moderate to briefly heavy
downpours. The main message on Monday and Tuesday is to keep a
raincoat/umbrella handy and to take shelter if you hear thunder or
see lightning. Remember, if you can hear thunder, then you`re
close enough to get struck by lightning.

That low lingers over CA for much of next week and will keep
temperatures below seasonal norms. Afternoon highs will range in
the 50s to 60s near the coast and 60s to 70s inland.

Another patchy stratus night as the marine layer continues to
compress and hinder inland penetration of low clouds. With the
