.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 236 AM PST Wed Jan 24 2024

Our next rain maker is here and will continue throughout this
morning before tapering off tonight/early Thursday morning. Drying
conditions return Thursday and continue throughout the upcoming
weekend, aside from a slight chance of rainfall across the North Bay
through late week. Above normal temperatures late this weekend into
early next week.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 236 AM PST Wed Jan 24 2024

Rain showers are currently moving through the North Bay, greater San
Francisco Bay Area, and across the Monterey Peninsula at this hour.
Rainfall will be heaviest during the early morning hours, mainly
before 10 AM PST. Rainfall totals across the coastal ranges of the
North Bay, Santa Cruz Mountains, and Big Sur Coast will be 0.50-
1.00" and elsewhere expect 0.10-0.50".

Given the saturated soils and receding creeks/streams will have to
keep a close eye on water level this morning and into tonight as
additional rain could cause a minor rise back into monitor stage.
This is especially true for the North Bay where creeks/streams
remain elevated. Drying conditions are expected by late tonight or
early Thursday morning.

.LONG TERM...
(Thursday through Tuesday)
Issued at 236 AM PST Wed Jan 24 2024

A ridge of high pressure will begin to build over the region
Thursday and Friday. That said, the tail end of a front may bring
light precipitation to the far northern portions of the North Bay
Thursday night through Saturday night. Rainfall looks to remain
light: less than 0.33" for the coastal ranges of Sonoma County and
less than 0.10" for valley locations through this timeframe.

From previous forecaster:

Sunday and Monday: High pressure re-builds Sunday into Monday across
the region, but once again is buffeted by a passing system to the
north. A few showers will be possible late Sunday into Monday across
far North Bay most of the Bay Area will be dry. The bigger story for
the weekend into next week will be the temperatures. Max temperature
will gradually warm over the weekend and peak on Monday. Current
forecast has max temps in the mid 60s to mid 70s Sunday/Monday. This
would be 10-15 degrees above normal for this time of year.
Additionally, this would near record values for late January.

Lastly, while not in the seven day time frame we are closely
watching what could be a notable pattern shift late Jan/early Feb.
Longer range guidance suggest an extension of the Pacific Jet. If
this pans out a period of very wet weather could impact CA. CPC 8-14
day outlook highlights a good portion of CA for heavy precip and
potential flooding. Additionally, ensemble river forecast does have
a few rivers with a 10-12% chance of hitting flood stage. In other
words, stay tuned as the forecast evolves.

widespread showers associated with a frontal system through the rest
