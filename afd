.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 358 AM PDT Sun Jul 9 2023

Forecast still on track for warming throughout the week, with the
hottest temperatures expected next weekend. Temperatures today
and through Monday continue to be below normal.

&&

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 358 AM PDT Sun Jul 9 2023

Across the region this early morning temperatures are running
about a degree or two cooler than this same time yesterday, likely
due to cold air advection as a weak shortwave trough passes
through the region. Winds continue to gust in the 20-25 mph range
at KOAK and through the Delta region, but do show signs of
weakening as the SFO- SAC gradient currently sits at +3.5 mb, down
from a maximum of +5.0 mb yesterday evening. Stratus is patchy at
best over land, with not as homogeneous of coverage across the
coastal zones as seen in previous nights.

Temps today expected to be similar to those seen Saturday, with
coastal regions in the 60s, and mid to upper 70s expected for inland
regions. Monday a warming trend begins with interior locations
reaching the low to mid 80s, such as the North Bay valleys, Santa
Clara valley, and East Bay hills. Hot spots are to be found in far
southern Monterey County with highs in the low 90s. Despite this,
temps generally remain about 5 degrees below normal for most
locations, though do begin to inch closer to normal by Tuesday as
the warming trend continues. Winds generally expected to be lighter
today than those seen on Saturday, but still become breezy across
the Delta and coastal gaps in the afternoon and evenings before
weakening into the night.

.LONG TERM...
(Monday through Saturday)
Issued at 358 AM PDT Sun Jul 9 2023

The aforementioned warming trend continues through the week as high
pressure continues to build into the region, with the hottest days
expected to be the weekend of the 15th and 16th. High pressure
initially builds over the desert southwest before slowly migrating
westward through the week. The center of the high looks to become
positioned over the San Joaquin valley Friday and lingers through
Saturday, where max temperatures jump to become above normal. A look
at ECMWF-HiRes 500 mb heights shows the high reaching to around 598
dam Saturday and Sunday, with 850 mb temperatures around 29 degrees
Celsius, climbing closer to 30 degrees Celsius Sunday. Oakland
sounding climatology for the dates of July 15th and 16th reveals
both the 500 mb heights and 850 mb temperatures falling into the
90th percentile. As such, have chosen to increase temperatures
Saturday and Sunday where temps will likely be about 10 degrees
above normal for many locations. Heat risk is currently moderate for
most locations Saturday, with a few locations in the far interior
seeing major heat risk. This being said, be sure to adequately
hydrate and if possible, avoid outdoors activity between the hours
of 10am and 6pm. Check in on vulnerable populations, and never leave
pets or children in vehicles.

Looking forward beyond Sunday, some hints at the center of the high
beginning an eastward trek, moving back over the desert southwest,
becoming centered over Arizona by Monday. Both GFS and ECMWF
ensembles lean towards this southeastern track beginning on Sunday,
though with more than 7 days out, there is still variability and
uncertainty as to the path. However, this could bring the potential
for slightly prolonged warmth and above normal temperatures in the
region through Tuesday. More details and updates to come.

.MARINE...
(Today through Friday)
Issued at 358 AM PDT Sun Jul 9 2023

Expect breezy to gusty northwest winds across the waters with
strongest winds along the coastline, especially along the North
Bay coast, south of Point Sur, as well as the San Francisco and
Monterey Bays during the afternoon and evening hours each day.
Winds across the outer waters will temporarily diminish on Sunday
but will increase again early Monday. With these strong winds,
expect steeper wind waves which are hazardous to small craft
vessels.
