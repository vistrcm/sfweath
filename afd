...New UPDATE...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 1145 PM PST Sun Feb 25 2024

Look for scattered showers today followed by colder temperatures
tonight following a cold frontal passage. A dry period will resume
midweek before unsettled weather returns. Moderate rain, breezy
winds, and even some high elevation snow are possible by next
weekend.

.UPDATE...
Issued at 716 AM PST Mon Feb 26 2024

Happy Monday everyone! We`re on track to get some light showers
today as the surface cold front, currently moving through NorCal,
progresses southward. In addition, a weak area of low pressure
continues to spin offshore from the Central Coast, resulting in
light radar returns over the coastal waters. As this front moves
into the region, rain chances will increase but accumulations
will remain light with only a few hundredths of an inch expected
across the area once all is said and done. The forecast remains on
track and no updates are needed at this time.

.SHORT TERM...
(Monday and Monday Night)
Issued at 1145 PM PST Sun Feb 25 2024

An upper trough will progress from the Pacific Northwest towards the
central Great Basin as low pressure aloft locates offshore from
SoCal. A cold front attendant to the upper trough will progress
through the Bay Area today before dissipating along the Central
Coast this evening. Scattered showers will accompany the front, with
the greatest coverage over the Central Coast. The overall moisture
available to work with is rather meager, so rain amounts aren`t
looking overly impressive. In fact, storm total amounts over the Bay
Area are now generally under 0.05", with 0.1" possible for portions
of Monterey and San Benito Counties. Given the more convective
nature of the showers can`t rule out a locally higher total here or
there, but overall expecting minimum rain impacts from this system.
Expect breezy northwest winds behind the frontal passage this
afternoon and evening with gusts to around 25 mph along the coast.
Colder air arrives behind the front tonight with temperatures
dipping into the 30s and lower 40s. Portions of the North Bay
interior Valleys and Mountains have a moderate to high probability
(35-70 percent) of reaching 36 degrees or colder, and therefore
considering both cold temperatures and societal impacts a Frost
Advisory was issued for these areas for late tonight into Tuesday
morning. This may be a borderline situation for some valley
locations it will likely dip to near/below 36 at least in pockets
towards morning. Portions of the East Bay may also approach Frost
Advisory thresholds, but confidence and probabilities here are a
bit lower outside of the higher terrain.

.LONG TERM...
(Tuesday through Sunday)
Issued at 1145 PM PST Sun Feb 25 2024

High pressure will bring dry conditions, northerly winds, and cooler
temperatures for Tuesday and Wednesday. Lows Wednesday morning will
remain chilly, with 30s away from the immediate coast and bays.

Conditions look rather unsettled for late week into the weekend as a
stronger storm system slowly migrates from the Gulf of Alaska
towards the West Coast. Breezy winds and hazardous marine conditions
will exist, along with periods of moderate rainfall. Storm total
amounts are holding steady from the previous forecast, with rain
spread out among several days. Global model ensemble members still
suggest total amounts around 1-2" for the lower elevations from
Thursday through Sunday, with higher totals in the coastal ranges.
Friday and Saturday remain the target period for when the heaviest
rain amounts are expected. This is colder system and snow levels
will lower this weekend. Some ridgetop snow accumulations are
possible, with the greatest potential for this over the Santa
Lucias and perhaps portions of the Diablo range.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 356 AM PST Mon Feb 26 2024

MVFR conditions prevail at North Bay and SF Bay terminals through at
least the first half of the TAF period as coastal stratus continues
to filter in through the Golden Gate at this hour. Into the
afternoon, chances for light rain showers appear, though any rain
showers are expected to be brief. In the afternoon hours as rain
chances appear, more southern terminals first start to see MVFR CIGs
develop. Winds generally out of the W/NW for most terminals this
afternoon and breezy. MVFR CIGs for all terminals dissipate into the
late night as shower cease, and winds slowly ease.


Vicinity of SFO...MVFR CIGs this morning last until the late
afternoon. Winds become breezy out of the NW and light rain showers
appear in the afternoon. Towards the evening hours, VFR returns as
low clouds push out. Winds stay elevated and moderate through much
of the night.

SFO Bridge Approach...Low clouds will continue to impact the
approach through the late morning.

Monterey Bay Terminals...VFR lasts until the afternoon. MVFR CIGs
develop in the afternoon just as the first rain arrives and winds
become moderate and onshore. VFR returns into the nighttime hours
and rain ends. Winds light overnight Monday into Tuesday.

&&

.MARINE...
(Today through Saturday)
Issued at 356 AM PST Mon Feb 26 2024

Light rain showers are expected to impact predominantly the
southern waters through the day today, with rain chances
diminishing into the night. Current southerly and light winds will
increase to become fresh and gusty out of the north. These gusty
winds will create hazardous conditions for small craft through
early Wednesday morning. Northwesterly swell continues to move
through the waters with a period of about 14-16 seconds.
