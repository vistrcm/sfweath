.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 329 AM PDT Mon Mar 18 2024

Satellite shows low clouds and fog along the coastal North Bay to
coastal San Mateo county including extending through the Golden
Gate to the Oakland/Berkeley Hills. A few patches of low clouds
and fog are developing over the Monterey Peninsula. Elsewhere a
few patches of valley fog are forming otherwise it`s clear.
Daytime highs today will be a few degrees warmer compared to
Sunday`s high temperatures, with readings reaching the 60s

.LONG TERM...
(Tuesday through Sunday)
Issued at 329 AM PDT Mon Mar 18 2024

A Rex Block (closed 500 mb high north of a closed 500 mb low)
continues over the western states today and tonight then will
dissipate Tuesday and Tuesday night. There`s good global model
agreement that a consolidation of a few lows will take shape over
the eastern Pacific Tuesday night into Thursday. On Friday light
to moderate rain will begin spreading across the forecast area as
the newly formed eastern Pacific low gets nudged eastward. Wet
weather is in store for late week and the weekend, with highest
rain totals 1" to 1.5" mainly along the coast especially across
the coastal hills and mountains. Relatively lesser amounts of
rain will fall over inland locations, with the least amount of
rain over the southern interior where a few hundredths to a tenth
of an inch are forecast. As always, the forecast can change,
especially if convection develops, this could boost local rainfall
amounts. Stay tuned to the latest updates. If planning travel to
or across the high mountain country check with your local NWS
office(s) or favorite media outlets for forecast details, it`ll be
cold enough for snow, please plan accordingly if traveling.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 430 AM PDT Mon Mar 18 2024

Low stratus and fog is developing across the region, albeit somewhat
slower than earlier model output had suggested. Ceiling impacts
to most terminals outside of mountainous areas or the interior are
still anticipated, but lower confidence in stratus onset times
across the board. Prevailing ceilings at APC and SNS have become
TEMPO groups as a result, with delayed onset of LIFR stratus at SFO
and OAK. Stratus expected to mix out later this morning, most likely
by 17-18Z although some model output keeps stratus in the area
through 20-21Z. Light to breezy onshore winds will set up Monday
afternoon and evening. Stratus returns tonight continuing through
Tuesday morning.

Vicinity of SFO... Stratus is currently tantalizingly close to the
terminal, expected to come over the airport shortly and continuing
through around 17-18Z. Lower confidence for LIFR ceilings as winds
are still somewhat stronger than earlier forecast. Considered
turning the prevailing LIFR ceiling into a TEMPO group but opted
against it. Breezy west-northwest winds set up this afternoon and
diminish later in the evening. Stratus returns tonight with the
lowest ceilings coming early Tuesday morning.

SFO Bridge Approach... Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals... Patchy stratus over MRY at present,
continuing until 17-18Z. Decreased confidence in ceilings at SNS has
led to the prevailing ceiling turning into a TEMPO group. Breezy
northwest winds will develop this afternoon and diminish in the
evening, with stratus building back in this evening into Tuesday
morning.

&&

.MARINE...
(Today through Saturday)
Issued at 913 AM PDT Mon Mar 18 2024

Fair weather continues through early Thursday morning as high
pressure presides over the region. Winds out of the northwest and
light to moderate through at least Wednesday. Come late Thursday,
chances of light rain begin and winds turn to become more
westerly. A moderate period northwesterly swell continues to
abate through the waters at this time with a new, longer period
northwesterly swell train arriving later today.
