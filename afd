...New AVIATION, MARINE...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 1210 AM PDT Sun Sep 29 2024

One more pleasant day before a drastic warm-up arrives Monday.
There will be widespread moderate to major HeatRisk through
Wednesday with some relief later in the week.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 1210 AM PDT Sun Sep 29 2024

The stratus coverage is expansive this morning with ceilings
generally between 300-1000 ft and a few reports of light drizzle.
A disturbance near the Channel Islands has disrupted the high
pressure ridge, and the marine layer is taking advantage of this
opportunity. The Ft. Ord microwave profiler shows the depth of the
cool humid air has expanded to near 1,500 ft this morning. As the
low pressure system and associated trough move inland and weaken
through the day today, a strong ridge will begin to build. This
will cause the marine layer to gradually compress, bringing a
beautiful, sun-filled afternoon, but also setting the stage for a
significant warm up beginning Monday.

.LONG TERM...
(Monday through Saturday)
Issued at 1210 AM PDT Sun Sep 29 2024

By early Monday morning, a 500 mb ridge will rebuild over the area
as surface high pressure develops over the PNW. This will trigger
substantial warming from Monday-Wednesday with afternoon
temperatures 10-20 degrees above normal. The surface pressure
over coastal California will stay pretty close to normal, but the
anomalous surface high to the North, and eventually NE will cause
some down-gradient, dry, offshore winds. The synoptic forcing is
fairly weak, and we are expecting the wind speed to remain gentle
to moderate. This weak forcing should allow the warm temperatures
to trigger a sea breeze wind reversal in the afternoons. As such,
the hottest part of the day may be a couple hours earlier than
expected. By Wednesday afternoon, the inland pressure will have
decreased enough to bring the return of onshore flow, and
temperatures are expected to cool to end the week. Let`s break
down the 2 big concerns for Monday-Wednesday:

Dangerous Heat Impacts. Inland temperatures will surpass 100
degrees. Importantly, the offshore winds will bring high
temperatures all the way to the coast. East San Francisco,
Oakland, and Santa Cruz are all expected to reach the lower 90s
on Tuesday. Widespread moderate HeatRisk with major HeatRisk
in higher elevations and throughout the East and South Bay will
bring an elevated chance for heat related illness to vulnerable
populations and anyone without access to adequate cooling. A lot
of people without air conditioning will be dealing with this. I`ll
make sure to check in on my elderly neighbor. Please consider
doing the same.

Fire Weather Concerns. Anyone who went through the 2017 North Bay
fires starts paying attention when we talk about offshore winds in
the fall. Fortunately this is a much different situation. The
synoptic forcing is quite weak the actual wind speed won`t be very
strong. The fuels will certainly respond to the hot, dry air,
however. This is especially true in the North Bay where the Energy
Release Component is expected to flirt with the record max value
for this time of year. With the moderate wind speed, we are not
expecting to reach red flag criteria. Nevertheless, fires will be
easier to start and spread during the first half of the week.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 518 AM PDT Sun Sep 29 2024

A mix of MVFR/IFR/LIFR CIGs are present throughout the region this
morning as stratus continues to advect inland. CIGs have begun to
lift slightly as the marine layer has deepened overnight. This being
said, expect most CIGs this morning to lift slowly before
eventually becoming VFR across the region late this morning.
Winds will increase out of the W/NW this afternoon generally to
become breezy around 10-12 knots, higher at KSFO. Winds will then
diminish into the late night to become light for most terminals.
Stratus is not expected to return for the majority of terminals
tonight as drier and warmer conditions erode the marine layer.
Some light offshore winds are expected to develop in the early
hours of Monday morning.

Vicinity of SFO...MVFR CIGs persist through the late morning,
clearing to VFR towards the 18Z window. Winds will increase out of
the NW this afternoon with winds reaching around 15 knots. Into the
late night, winds ease to become light, but develop a slight
offshore component in the early morning of Monday. No CIGs expected
to develop in the remainder of the TAF period.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...LIFR CIGs persist through at least sunrise,
but are expected to begin lifting afterwards to become IFR. Clearing
to VFR is expected late towards noon. Winds NW and breezy this
afternoon, then diminishing to become light in the nighttime.
Stratus is expected to return, though there is some question as to
exact timing. Current thoughts and highest confidence reside in a
later return of stratus and IFR CIGs, generally towards 07-09Z
Monday. This will be something to keep an eye on in future
updates.

.MARINE...
(Today through Friday)
Issued at 518 AM PDT Sun Sep 29 2024

Northwesterly winds will continue to strengthen to become fresh to
strong over the outer waters. Over the far northern outer waters,
gusts may become near-gale force on Sunday and Sunday night, but
begin to diminish Monday. Significant wave heights will build to 8
to 13 feet over the outer waters and portions of the northern
inner waters by late this weekend. Given elevated wave heights and
wind gusts, rough seas will persist over the outer waters through
the end of the forecast period.
