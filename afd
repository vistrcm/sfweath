.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 245 AM PST Mon Dec 16 2024

A weak disturbance will pass over Northern California today,
spreading light rain across the region from north to south. Total
rainfall amounts for today look to be around 0.50-0.80" for the
higher terrain of the North Bay region, and closer to 0.25-0.5"
elsewhere. The rest of the Bay Area, Santa Cruz, and the Santa Lucia
Ranges amounts look to be closer to 0.25" or less, while the the
Central Coast and interior areas closer to meager a 0.10" of rain or
less. Conditions will begin to dry out late tonight and into early

.LONG TERM...
(Tuesday through Sunday)
Issued at 245 AM PST Mon Dec 16 2024

Ensemble guidance favors dry weather through the work week, with a
slight warming trend occuring. This looks to change for the weekend
as an upper level low slides into the eastern Pacific. Unsettled and
wet weather looks likely; however, it remains too early to hone on
specifics such as timing, rain amounts, and wind.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 410 AM PST Mon Dec 16 2024

KMUX shows rain entering the North Bay which is reducing CIGs/VIS
conditions at STS. LIFR conditions and fog has been observed at LVK
with visibilities down to a 1/4SM reported. Showers will gradually
spread south throughout the morning. Showers should reach LVK closer
to 16 to 17Z which should help to reduce fog coverage and improve
conditions from LIFR to MVFR. All other sites, CIGs and VIS will
decrease as the rain band moves south with MVFR CIGs to persist
through late Monday. Showers should remain light but if a stronger
cell moves over the airport IFR to LIFR conditions may temporarily
develop. Winds will generally stay out of the south to southeast
with more moderate winds possible around the time of frontal passage.

Vicinity of SFO...VFR through 16/17Z when the approaching rain band
will allow for MVFR CIGs/VIS to develop. Moderate southerly winds
are expected around the time of frontal passage but winds are
expected to weaken and gradually become northwesterly again by the
end of the TAF period. Temporary IFR to LIFR conditions are possible
if a stronger cell moves over the airport.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...VFR becoming MVFR. Showers begin to
approach the Monterey Bay region by late morning with showers
becoming more likely during the early afternoon. Winds generally
stay light and southerly but more moderate winds are expected to
develop at SNS ahead of frontal passage. Conditions start to improve
towards the end of the TAF period with CIGs lifting around 09Z for
SNS and after the end of this TAF period for MRY.

.MARINE...
(Today through Saturday)
Issued at 245 AM PST Mon Dec 16 2024

Near gale force southerly winds are occurring across the far
northern outer waters due to the passage of a weak cold front.
These  winds will diminish quickly throughout the morning after
the cold  front has progressed south. This cold front will also
bring light  rain gradually spreading southwards throughout the
morning. Dry  weather and light, generally northerly, winds return
Tuesday as high  pressure builds. Guidance indicates conditions
will become unsettled  again this weekend as another low pressure
system forms in the  Pacific Ocean. Long period swell will arrive
midweek, potentially  causing increased shoaling on harbor
entrances.
