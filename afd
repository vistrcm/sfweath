.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 1221 AM PST Thu Nov 30 2023

Breezy today into early Friday with small rain chances. High
pressure brings a warming trend for the weekend. Unsettled pattern
persists into next week with the best rain potential across the
North Bay.

&&

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 1221 AM PST Thu Nov 30 2023

An upper level trough will progress through the region today as
surface troughing reaches the Bay Area this evening. Strong high
pressure will evolve over the northeast Pacific as lower pressure
over the Great Basin maintains a robust onshore pressure gradient.
Given weak forcing and only modest lower tropospheric moisture we`re
not looking for a whole lot in the rain department with some of the
coastal ranges perhaps picking up 0.1" or so. Amounts will be much
less elsewhere and on the order of a few hundredths for those who do
see precipitation today. The greatest rain potential (15-25%) is
generally from mid to late afternoon across the Bay Area and from
late afternoon to early evening for the Central Coast. Given the
aforementioned pressure gradient expect breezy onshore winds along
the coastal interface, within the favorably oriented valleys, within
the higher terrain and within the local gaps and passes. While we
look to fall short of Wind Advisory criteria gusts in the 20-25 mph
range are expected across the region later today and tonight. Given
onshore flow and the increased cloud cover highs will largely top
out right around 60 degrees for most areas today. Clearing skies
tonight will allow overnight lows to dip into the 30s and 40s;
coldest in the North Bay Valleys and in far southern Monterey
County.

.LONG TERM...
(Friday through Wednesday)
Issued at 1221 AM PST Thu Nov 30 2023

We`ll remain in an unsettled northwest flow pattern aloft through
late week as a series of weak impulses traverse the mean flow.
However the best moisture and forcing should remain displaced to our
north. Any rain amounts we do see should be rather inconsequential,
although accumulations of up to 0.5" or so are possible in the
Sonoma coastal range. High pressure builds at the surface and aloft
this weekend leading to drier conditions and a warming trend in
temperatures. The ridge weakens for mid to late next week as upper
troughing impinges on far NorCal around this time.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 410 AM PST Thu Nov 30 2023

Current satellite shows scattered high clouds pushing through the
region, obscuring any views of patchy fog that has brought IFR-MVFR
conditions to North Bay, and Monterey Bay terminals this morning.
Patchy fog is expected to dissipate towards sunrise. Outside of
these few terminals experiencing fog, conditions are VFR, and
expected to remain so through the remainder of the TAF period for
most, with the exception of KSFO and Monterey Bay terminals where
low CIGs may intermittently develop this morning and afternoon.
Winds this afternoon onshore and breezy to gusty, with most
terminals seeing gusts up to about 20-22 knots on average. Winds
then weaken into the late night to become light and variable for
most locations.


Vicinity of SFO...VFR through the morning, with scattered low clouds
developing. Into the afternoon, MVFR conditions develop briefly near
20Z as low clouds intermittently form a CIG, but confidence in this
at this time is moderate. Beyond 22Z, highest confidence is in a
return of prevailing VFR conditions. Winds out of the W/NW this
afternoon to be strong and gusty, with gusts up to 27 knots, and
lasting through the late night. Winds decrease but remain breezy
come the early to mid morning hours of Friday.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...IFR conditions this morning improve to
become MVFR into the late morning as low clouds lift and winds
begin to increase out of the NW. Winds become breezy and gusting
up to 23 knots into the late afternoon. VFR conditions return into
the evening today, just as winds begin to decrease to become
light to moderate.


&&

.MARINE...
(Today through Tuesday)
Issued at 410 AM PST Thu Nov 30 2023

Gentle to moderate winds persist through the early morning today
then become strong in the late morning, with gale force winds
possible over the far southern coastal waters near Point Sur.
These  stronger winds last through Friday morning for most
locations,  with the exception of the far southern zones where
stronger winds persist through at least late Friday. Towards the
start of the  weekend, a larger, moderate period, northwest swell
arrives.  Weather conditions will remain unsettled into the
weekend.
