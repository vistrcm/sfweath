...New SYNOPSIS, SHORT TERM, LONG TERM...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 400 AM PDT Wed Jul 5 2023

Seasonably cool temperatures will persist for much of the upcoming
week. Night and morning low clouds clearing to the coast each
afternoon will also continue. Building high pressure will bring
warmer temperatures to the region early next week.

&&

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 400 AM PDT Wed Jul 5 2023

Satellite fog product is almost a mirror image from 24 hours ago.
Widespread stratus covering the coastal waters pushing well
inland too. In fact, there is a little more stratus coverage
tonight than last night, especially in Napa Valley. All of this
shouldn`t be too much of a surprise given features than drive
stratus coverage are similar: N-S gradient is weak, W-E gradient
is moderate, longwave pattern still shows trough covering NorCal
with high pressure to the south. The marine layer is roughly 2,000
feet deep. Patchy fog and drizzle will be possible through the
morning hours. Inland stratus will gradually erode and roll back
to the coast mid-late morning. Coastal areas will hold onto some
low stratus through the day, but sunny skies are expected inland.
Continued onshore flow and a deepening trough over NorCal will
lead to cooler temperatures across the entire forecast area
today. Highs today will be in the upper 50s/upper 60s coast/bays
and 70s to near 90 inland. Onshore flow will also lead to breezy
conditions during the afternoon/evening hours too.

The clouds lurking along the coast through the day will move
inland once again this evening and overnight.

.LONG TERM...
(Thursday through Tuesday)
Issued at 400 AM PDT Wed Jul 5 2023

The cooling trended that has developed will continue through at
least Friday as an upper level trough remains over the region.
Given the forecast, daytime highs will be 5 to 15 degrees below
normal for early July. Night and morning clouds with a solid
marine layer will continue as well. Conditions begin to moderate
Saturday into Sunday as a weak upper level low passes over the
region. This passing feature may disrupt the marine layer and
result in slightly warmer temperatures. A bigger shift in the
longwave pattern occurs early next week as high pressure currently
over the Desert SW builds westward. The building ridge will help
to compress the marine layer and bring interior heat back to the
Bay Area and Central Coast. Current forecast has 100+ temperatures
across the interior returning next Tuesday and Wednesday.
Confidence on the building ridge is moderate and is further
supported by WPC cluster agreement. Stay tuned...

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 358 AM PDT Wed Jul 5 2023

The SFO-SAC pressure gradient is 3.9 mb, onshore winds are ushering
stratus /IFR-MVFR/ inland again this morning, the marine layer depth
is 2100 feet. Model output show patchy light drizzle again for this
morning, though not much except possibly a few traces developed
Tuesday morning. The marine layer stratus mixed out rather quickly
Tuesday morning prior to the more usual afternoon diurnal mixing and
dissipation, especially given the depth and extent of morning stratus;
the mix out may have been sped up by a westward propagating gravity
wave over the South Bay and the north Central Coast, upon inspection
of visible satellite imagery. For today, the HREF shows an extensive
inland intrusion of stratus /IFR-MVFR/ with mixing out beginning by
late morning and continuing this afternoon. The 12z Bay Area TAFs
advertise mixing out of stratus 18z-19z today. Stratus still could
linger in the North Bay for example since the STS-UKI gradient is
currently moderate at 1.6 mb and if this continues through morning.

Stratus /IFR-MVFR/ move back inland tonight and Thursday morning,
onshore winds continuing through the 12z TAF cycle.

Vicinity of SFO...SCT vs BKN ceiling this morning since it`s
taking time for the stratus to develop at SFO. MVFR due to stratus
is forecast to prevail 14z-18z this morning, VFR by early
afternoon and continuing through the afternoon. MVFR stratus
ceiling redeveloping by mid evening and prevailing overnight into
Thursday morning.

SFO Bridge Approach...MVFR ceiling in stratus until late morning
or early afternoon, VFR this afternoon and evening. MVFR redeveloping
tonight and continuing Thursday morning.

Monterey Bay Terminals...IFR-MVFR in stratus, onshore winds
continuing today 5 to 15 knots. Patchy light drizzle possible, but
not currently noted in TAFs. Stratus ceilings gradually lifting
today though MVFR ceilings could linger into the afternoon with a
nearby stratus feed. Otherwise expecting an early return of stratus
this evening with IFR-MVFR ceilings.

.MARINE...
(Today through Monday)
Issued at 323 AM PDT Wed Jul 5 2023

Surface high pressure over the eastern Pacific will result in
increasingly gusty northwest winds across the coastal waters
Thursday and Friday, lasting into the weekend. Gusty afternoon
and evening winds also developing each day into the weekend over
the San Francisco Bay north of the Bay Bridge to the Delta. Longer
period southerly swell 16-18 seconds and shorter period
northwesterly swell continues through the week before a new
southerly swell train arrives Friday.
