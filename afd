.SYNOPSIS...

Scattered showers diminishing across the region through the day,
with lingering nuisance flooding impacts possible. More rain follows

into the weekend.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 325 AM PST Mon Jan 22 2024

Radar returns show shower activity continuing across the SF Bay Area
and Central Coast, expected to move out through the course of the
day. As of 3 AM, observed rain totals for the previous 24 hours
included 2.44" at Sonoma County Airport, 3.98" at Venado, 3.97" at
the Middle Peak RAWS (Mount Tam), 0.60" at the Napa County Airport,
0.92" at downtown San Francisco, 1.05" at Oakland Museum, 0.51" at
San Jose Airport, 3.27" at the Ben Lomond RAWS, 0.33" at Monterey
Airport, and 0.80" at the Big Sur RAWS. Overnight the office
received numerous reports of urban nuisance floods, small streams
rising, and small landslides, mainly concentrated on the North Bay
but extending as far south as the mountains of Santa Cruz county.

Additional rainfall totals vary from up to 0.2" in the North Bay,
to 0.2-0.5" across the Bay Area and Central Coast, and up to
0.75" in the higher elevations across the central Coast. Lingering
flood impacts will be likely for the rest of the day,
particularly where any stray post-frontal showers do pop up. The
chance for thunderstorms has diminished through the night, and at
this stage convection is most likely to be the exception rather
than the norm. Perhaps about a 10% chance of a thunderstorm across
the greater SF Bay Area and Central Coast. Highs today are
expected to be around the upper 50s to lower 60s in the lower
elevations, and the 50s or even the upper 40s in the higher
elevations. Areas of fog are possible tonight into Tuesday
morning, when low temperatures are expected to fall into the mid
to upper 40s.

.LONG TERM...
(Tuesday through Sunday)
Issued at 325 AM PST Mon Jan 22 2024

Tuesday should begin as a dry day, with one last frontal system
grazing the area late Tuesday into Wednesday. Rain totals should be
relatively modest, with the North Bay coastal ranges seeing 0.5-1"
of rain, the Santa Cruz and Santa Lucia mountains seeing 0.3-0.5",
the SF Bay Area seeing 0.1-0.4" of rain, and the Central Coast
seeing up to 0.3" of rain. Beyond Wednesday, an upper level ridge
should develop across the West Coast, bringing a period of dry and
mild conditions to the region. By next weekend, high temperatures
could rise to the upper 60s to lower 70s in the interior valleys,
and the low to mid 60s in the coastal, Bayshore, and higher
elevation regions.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 325 AM PST Mon Jan 22 2024

Generally MVFR-VFR with mid-level clouds as scattered showers
continue across the SF Bay Area and Central Coast. Shower activity
expected to diminish through the day with conditions generally
remaining MVFR, except marginally IFR conditions possible in the
North Bay valleys. Breezy southerly winds at present will gradually
turn to the west and the northwest by the afternoon. Some
uncertainty in the evolution of ceilings tonight into Tuesday
morning, but the highest confidence at this time is for MVFR-IFR
ceilings to generally persist, at least through the early part of
Tuesday morning.

Vicinity of SFO... Shower activity expected to decrease through the
morning. Winds will turn from the south to a more southwesterly
direction for the afternoon, then to the west for the evening. MVFR
ceilings expected to continue through the early part of Tuesday
morning.

SFO Bridge Approach... Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals... Shower activity continues and should move
away by the afternoon. Generally MVFR ceilings through the TAF
period, with breezy southerly winds gradually turning towards the
northwest through the morning. Low confidence of IFR-LIFR ceiling
development tonight into Tuesday morning.

&&

.MARINE...
(Today through Saturday)
Issued at 325 AM PST Mon Jan 22 2024

Gusty southerly winds continue through sunrise near the coast
south of Pigeon Point. Winds will shift to northwest and weaken
to moderate breezes by this afternoon. Light rain returns midweek.
Moderate period west to northwest swell continues to move through
the waters with a new long period west to northwest swell
arriving late tonight and Tuesday.

&&

.HYDROLOGY...
Issued at 325 AM PST Mon Jan 22 2024

A Flood Watch remains in effect for the North Bay through this
evening. The main rain bands have moved through the North Bay with
scattered showers for the rest of the day. However, with already
saturated soils, minor nuisance flooding of roadways and creeks
are likely.

USGS instrumentation throughout the San Francisco Bay Area indicates
that shallow soils on steep hillsides are approaching saturation.
With more rain incoming to further saturate soils, shallow
landslides across the CWA remain a possibility.
