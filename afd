.SHORT TERM...
(Today and Saturday)
Issued at 319 AM PDT Fri Oct 4 2024

Although it`s a relatively quiet night, quite a bit to look at
meteorologically. First and foremost are the thermal belts and the
impressive nocturnal drying that occurred this morning. As of
writing, there are several sites above 1200` reporting temps in
the low- to-mid 80s and RH as low as 1-5%. Some of these sites are
reporting dewpoints that are rarely seen outside of a continental
polar airmass. Thankfully there is very little wind, if any,
across most of these sites. The exceptions being some of the
highest peaks in the North Bay, such as Atlas Peak and Mt. St.
Helena, which are seeing winds up to 20 mph. Given the winds are
isolated to just a few sites, have held off from issuing a Red
Flag Warning this morning. This nocturnal drying event has mainly
taken place in the North Bay, and to some extent in the high
terrain around the Bay Area. Dewpoints have started to recover and
continue to trend upwards. This trend will be monitored
throughout the morning to assess the need to escalate fire weather
messaging (more in the FIRE WEATHER section below). If you were
watching radar this morning, you also may have noticed some weak
returns off the Central Coast moving to the NE. These are actually
some elevated showers associated with some leftover tropical
moisture at about 10,000`. The sad news is that there is an
near zero chance of any liquid making it to the ground, since any
rain that is falling would have to fall through a very deep layer
of 4-10% RH and would certainly evaporate. The good news is that
we are not expecting any lightning activity.

In terms of the ongoing heat wave, the above normal temperatures
continue today, but we`ll shave a few degrees off of what we saw
yesterday. Temps will spike again Saturday as we see another weak
push of offshore winds during the morning hours. As such, the
Excessive Heat Warning and Heat Advisories that are currently in
effect have been extended to Saturday night.

.LONG TERM...
(Sunday through Thursday)
Issued at 319 AM PDT Fri Oct 4 2024

Going into the end of the weekend we should start to see some
gradual relief as the ridge axis migrates eastward. The relief
will be rather slow, however, and some areas may hold on to
impactful heat into Monday, especially inland and southward along
the Central Coast. There does appear some reasonable confidence in
the pattern finally breaking down with a longwave trough moving in
from the northwest by Tuesday. Ensemble guidance has also
consistently advertised something we would all welcome this time
of year as this trough digs into the West Coast by the end of the
week. The signal is rather weak as of this issuance, but it has
been there through the last few days of model guidance with
consistent timing, so I`m inclined to take it at least a little
bit seriously. I don`t want to jinx us, so I`ll just say the word
starts with "R" and rhymes with "brain".

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 1117 PM PDT Thu Oct 3 2024

VFR through the TAF period for all of the TAF sites. Dry conditions
will limit cloud cover for all but the most immediate coast. Expect
light and variable winds through the morning with more moderate
winds expected into the afternoon, but becoming light again into
the mid evening and early night.

Vicinity of SFO...VFR through the TAF period. Winds stay light
through the morning before increasing to around 12 kts in the mid
afternoon before becoming light again Friday night.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...VFR through the TAF period. Expect light
and variable winds through the early morning but winds become
moderate in the late morning. Winds become light again Friday
night.

.MARINE...
(Today through Wednesday)
Issued at 544 AM PDT Fri Oct 4 2024

Dry thunderstorm activity is being observed in the southern
waters with lighting possible into the mid morning. Light winds
are expected through the weekend. More moderate winds arrive into
the next work week with seas beginning to become more elevated.

.FIRE WEATHER...
Issued at 319 AM PDT Fri Oct 4 2024

An impressive nocturnal drying event has taken place this
morning, dropping humidities in the North Bay and Bay Area to the
1-5% range above about 1200 feet. However, the wind across most of
the area is light, with the exception of a couple of sites at the
highest peaks in the North Bay, which are seeing winds of 15-20
mph. Since the nocturnal drying event took place, dewpoints have
started to recover. This trend and the overall lack of wind were
the main decision points to NOT issue a Red Flag Warning for these
areas. This trend will continue to be monitored through this
morning and this evening, should another nocturnal drying event
take place tonight. Otherwise, conditions and expectation remain
largely unchanged from the previous forecast issuances. Very dry
conditions persist through the weekend with near record fuel
loading across the region. We are not expecting wind to be a major
factor for fire weather over the next several days. However, with
fuels as dry as they are combined with the warm conditions, fire
danger remains high.
