.SHORT TERM...
Issued at 1214 AM PST Mon Jan 12 2026
(Today through Sunday)

Cold Weather Advisory in effect for inland locations will expire
this morning, and will likely be the last issuance of the week as
temps warm under the building high pressure aloft.

Now check this out. Doing things differently this morning. For
this discussion, I`m considering "short term" to be the current 7
day forecast period, then I`ll discuss a bit more into the future
in the long term discussion. This won`t be a normal thing going
forward. Just for now since there is really no notable change
between days 1-2 and days 3-7.

Do you have outdoor chores to do, or enjoy a picturesque sunrise
or sunset, or wondering if your outdoor plans are going to hold up
this weekend. In short, do the chores, watch the sunset, and your
plans are fine. The only thing you should double check this week
are beach/surf conditions, should you find yourself there. There
is an increased risk for sneaker waves along all Pacific Coast
beaches this week, most notably in the early half of the week.
Refer to the BEACHES section below for more.

.LONG TERM...
Issued at 1214 AM PST Mon Jan 12 2026
(Next week)

In the extended (looking out further than we normally do just for
honorable mention), we`re starting to see signs of this very
strong ridge breaking down. Starting around the middle of next
week (Jan 21-22), ensemble cluster analysis is start to better
advertise some kind of shift in the large-scale pattern. This is
still pretty uncertain given that there is still a good deal of
spread among member solutions. However, if the pattern does shift
more in our favor, a reasonable time window for the next rainfall
would be mid-to-late next week.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 312 AM PST Mon Jan 12 2026

Localized fog is being reported at STS with LIFR conditions expected
to continue through the late morning hours, while mist at HAF
persists for around the same time period. High resolution model
output is depicting a moderate to high confidence for fog
redeveloping at STS tonight, and lower confidence for radiational
stratus and fog in the San Francisco Bay and the Santa Clara Valley
near SJC. The rest of the region is expected to remain VFR through
the TAF period. Winds will be generally light with offshore flow
across the interior valleys and a gentle onshore wind developing in
the afternoon across most of the region.

Vicinity of SFO... Moderate to high confidence of VFR through the
TAF period. High resolution model output is depicting some
probability for radiational fog to develop this evening and
overnight over the San Francisco Bay, but impacts to the terminal
are far less certain. Winds will be around 5 knots at strongest,
developing from the northeast this morning before backing to a
northwest flow in the afternoon.

SFO Bridge Approach... Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals... VFR through the TAF period. Breezy
drainage winds at SNS continue through the morning hours, otherwise
winds remain light with variable to vaguely onshore flow during the
day and drainage winds developing overnight.

.MARINE...
(Today through Saturday)
Issued at 312 AM PST Mon Jan 12 2026

A moderate northerly breeze and long period moderate-rough
westerly swell will persist today before gradual improvement
begins on Tuesday through the work week.

&&

.BEACHES...
Issued at 211 PM PST Sun Jan 11 2026

A Beach Hazard Statement is in effect through 6PM PST Monday for
all Pacific Coast beaches. A longer period moderate swell will
bring hazardous beach conditions with increased risk for rip
currents, sneaker waves, and larger shore break. This will result
in dangerous conditions along the shoreline. Hazardous beach
conditions are expected to continue through Thursday with the
issuance of additional Beach Hazard Statements likely.

Stay off of jetties, piers, rocks, and other waterside
infrastructure. Remain out of the water to avoid hazardous surf
and NEVER turn your back on the ocean. Monitor local weather, surf
and tide forecasts at www.weather.gov/mtr.
