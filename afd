...New UPDATE, MARINE...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 857 AM PDT Thu Oct 17 2024

A storm system will move through the Great Basin resulting in
gusty winds and critical fire weather conditions to the region
Thursday through Saturday.

&&

.UPDATE...
Issued at 915 AM PDT Thu Oct 17 2024

While we wait for offshore flow to kick in, we`re currently
dealing with some patchy stratus and locally dense fog along
Monterey Bay and Salinas Valley. The biggest impact will be the
dense fog, which will linger through 10 AM. As for the offshore
flow gradient: still onshore for the larger scale and is still on
track to switch by late this afternoon/early this evening.

No update needed at this time...will focus afternoon forecast on
evolving offshore flow event with wind and fire weather concerns.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 112 AM PDT Thu Oct 17 2024

The pressure gradient will tighten throughout the day as low
pressure develops over the Desert Southwest and subtropical high
pressure over the Eastern Pacific Ocean shifts east, this will lead
to the strongest winds of the event occurring today. Fortunately
from a fire weather standpoint winds throughout the day will be
northwesterly and thus remaining at least somewhat moist. The script
is flipped though tonight into tomorrow...

&&

.LONG TERM...
(Friday through Wednesday)
Issued at 112 AM PDT Thu Oct 17 2024

As a cutoff low develops in the Great Basin overnight, winds will
veer to become northerly, kicking off the drying trend. As this
cutoff low digs further south through the day Friday, winds will
further veer to become northeasterly/offshore, resulting in rapid
drying and compressional warming. Winds largely on the order of 25-
35 mph can be expected with gusts to 50 mph, but just how strong
winds are will be heavily dependent upon the terrain. Highest
terrain, ridgetops, gaps, and passes will be favored Friday and
Saturday with isolated gusts up to 65 mph through the Altamont Pass.
To make matters worse, a backdoor cold front will move through the
region during the day Friday, ushering in an even drier airmass. I
want to emphasize that all three days of this event will pose high
fire danger; however, I do believe that the Friday night into
Saturday morning timeframe will be of greatest concern due to the
compounding effects of the antecedent conditions. Every effort
should be made to prevent a wildfire spark always, but especially
over the next three days.

The offshore pressure gradient will weaken and begin to reverse
Saturday night into Sunday, restoring order and onshore flow to the
region. The start of next week looks to be relatively quiet with a
stable zonal flow pattern dominating the Contiguous United States.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 431 AM PDT Thu Oct 17 2024

Outside of some temporary IFR mist at the North Bay terminals
this morning, VFR conditions will persist through the TAF period.
Don`t stop reading! Wind will be challenging today. Over the next
36 hours, a trough in the jet stream will move across the area
and spawn a cut-off low pressure system over Arizona. This pattern
will bring strong onshore winds that will veer northerly
(offshore) through the 2nd half of the TAF period. As the wind
shifts, most terminals will deal with non-standard wind
directions. Winds will be stronger aloft, creating low-level wind
shear potential this evening as the boundary layer decouples.

Vicinity of SFO...High confidence VFR through the TAF period, but
winds will be a challenge for 3 reasons. 1) Wind speed. Sustained
winds are already 17 knots, and will only increase through the
day. An airfield wind advisory is in effect from 22Z to 12Z for
winds gusting as high as 40 kt this afternoon. 2) Wind direction.
As the winds veer from the standard WNW to NNW, a significant
cross-wind component will develop at the 28L/28R runways. 3) Wind
shear. Winds at 2,000 ft will be roughly twice as strong and from
the NNE, creating a moderate risk for LLWS, particularly from
03Z-06Z.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...VFR through the TAF period. Winds won`t
be quite as strong as the terminals further north, but the terrain
restricted surface winds will increase the chance for a decoupled
boundary layer and LLWS this evening.

&&

.MARINE...
(Today through Tuesday)
Issued at 855 AM PDT Thu Oct 17 2024

The gradient between high pressure over the eastern Pacific and
the developing lower pressure over the Intermountain West
continues to increase. Northwest winds will gradually increase
from a fresh breeze to near gale force by late Thursday morning
and continue into early Friday morning. Wind waves will also build
during this time, reaching 12-14 feet by late Thursday. Winds
decrease back to a moderate breeze by Saturday, allowing rough
seas to abate through the weekend.

&&

.FIRE WEATHER...
Issued at 900 AM PDT Thu Oct 17 2024

Morning update...just completed coordination calls with fire
partners. No real change with ongoing Red Flag Warnings valid 11
PM Thursday until 5 PM Saturday for all Bay Area and Central Coast
zones, except for the coasts of Marin, Monterey, and Sonoma
Counties. Strong winds will develop Thursday, fortunately the
northwesterly direction will help to keep daytime relative
humidity in the 20-40% range. Fire weather conditions will
deteriorate Thursday night as a deep upper-level low drops into
the Great Basin, creating an offshore gradient that will promote
northeasterly/offshore winds that will result in rapid drying and
compressional warming with daytime relative humidity on Friday and
Saturday as low as 10-20%. The windiest timeframes will be
Thursday night into Friday morning and Friday night into Saturday
morning with winds largely on the order of 25-35 mph, gusts to 50
mph with isolated gusts up to 65 mph along the highest terrain and
ridgetops and through gaps and passes. While fuels are near
average for this time of year, they are forecast to dry out
through this inside slider event.


FUELS info: the impacts from the last heatwave definitely have
eased, but this round of offshore flow will cause a response
easily in the grasses/finer/10 hour fuels. Response to 100 hour
fuels will be noticed, but values will not reach critical levels.
Energy Release Component (ERCs) values increase as well across the
fire district, but fall short of record values.

Putting this all into perspective - the offshore flow is a
moderate event, but a few fires are possible with marginal fuels
and decent fire weather ingredients.
