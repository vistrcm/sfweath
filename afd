.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 400 AM PDT Fri Jun 2 2023

Coastal areas continue to be impacted by low clouds and patchy
fog this morning. Low clouds will extend inland into the valleys
night and morning hours. A modest warming trend continues through
this weekend with Sunday being the warmest day. Cooling trend
returns the first part of next week as an upper low moves into CA.
This low could pull in subtropical moisture aloft which could
translate to a 15 to 25 percent chance for showers by Tuesday with
around a 10 percent chance for thunderstorms. Though confidence
is on the lower end now for showers and thunderstorms, details
should become more firm over the weekend.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 400 AM PDT Fri Jun 2 2023

It`s another cloudy morning for our CWA as the marine layer hasn`t
changed much in the past few days. Current nighttime satellite
imagery displays the cloudiest conditions along the SF Peninsula
along with much of the Santa Clara valley and all around the
Monterey Bay region including filling up the Salinas Valley
towards SoCal. There are patches of low clouds in North Bay
(primarily in Napa County) and in East Bay that could expand in
coverage as we get closer to sunrise. Visibilities are fairly good
as of the 3 am hour with only a few observations lowering to
around 5 to 6 statute miles. With the environment not changing
much, current temperatures are fairly similar to 24 hours ago and
only oscillating by 1-2 degrees.

Subtle changes expected after sunrise today as weak high pressure
ridging develops along the central and northern CA coastline.
Thus, we could see a few degrees of warming in afternoon highs
today (more likely inland and where coastal clouds aren`t
lingering all day). Get ready for 60s closer to the coast with 70s
and 80s inland.

The ridge strengthens and amplifies overnight tonight which will
bring a more noticeable warming trend for the weekend.

.LONG TERM...
(Saturday through Thursday)
Issued at 400 AM PDT Fri Jun 2 2023

Saturday and Sunday: With the strengthening ridge this weekend,
afternoon highs will continue to warm peaking on Sunday. Highs on
Sunday will be in the 60s to low 70s closer to the coast with mid
70s to upper 80s inland. However, far interior places like
Northeastern Napa county and portions of East Bay adjacent to the
central valley could see low 90s. Coastal stratus could still
impact the immediate coastline which would limit warming. However,
the ridging aloft will compress the marine layer so there`s not
as much areal coverage of inland stratus intrusion.

Next week: We`ll be monitoring the trend in precipitation chances
for the Monday and Tuesday timeframe. Ensemble guidance continues
to show an upper level low moving into SoCal early next week
which, if that track holds, would allow for sub-tropical moisture
aloft to wrap around the low into our region. This will bring the
possibility of some showers or even a few thunderstorms the first
part of the week. Confidence remains low at this point with about
a 15-25% chance for showers on Tuesday and around a 10% chance for
thunderstorms. Will be monitoring future forecast model trends to
see if those probabilities increase in the next couple of days. If
so, then our confidence will be stronger in the possibility of
rain early next week. As it stands now, if we do get rain, totals
would be minimal for Monday thru Tuesday with around 0.10"-0.15"
at most. Will continue to fine tune the details in the next day or
two.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 419 AM PDT Fri Jun 2 2023

Patchy night for stratus under building high pressure and a
relatively dry marine layer. The marine layer is still deeper than
what we would expect under strong high pressure, but is more
compressed this morning with MVFR cigs around 1400 ft. Not expecting
much more stratus coverage through this morning other than what is
already there. Slight chance for some patchy FG near KSTS this
morning. Stratus currently lingering around Bay Area terminals also
not likely to completely fill in, but is expected to increase in
coverage enough to briefly impact some of the terminals by sunrise.
Clearing to VFR during the 16-17Z hour for most terminals and breezy
onshore flow this afternoon.

Vicinity of SFO...Stratus deck just on the western edge of the
terminal evident via satellite. As previously mentioned, don`t
expect the stratus deck to expand over the entire SF Bay, instead
only slight expansions in coverage around what is already there.
Expect stratus to briefly impact the terminal through about the 15-
16Z hour, then VFR after through the rest of the day. Gusty W winds
to 20-25 kts this afternoon and early evening, diminishing after
sunset. Uncertain return of stratus tonight given the building high
pressure. Ensemble guidance strongly hints and very sparse coverage
once again into Saturday morning.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...Higher certainty around Monterey Bay
terminals than elsewhere regarding cigs this morning and tonight.
Clearing to VFR inland by about the 19Z hour. Closer to the coast,
stratus will likely not mix out over the water and will hang very
near the coastline. Locations like KMRY and southern portions of the
Monterey Bay have a moderate chance of continuing MVFR through the
TAF period. Slight chance for brief clearing in the 22-00Z time
frame before a robust return by midnight.

.MARINE...
(Today through Wednesday)
Issued at 308 AM PDT Fri Jun 2 2023

Gusty winds will gradually diminish through this morning and
afternoon. Gale force gusts will return to the northern waters
again late Saturday into Sunday. Expect generally a strong
northwest breeze to continue through the weekend with windiest
spots staying north of Pigeon Point. These stronger winds are
generating steep wind waves that are hazardous to small craft.
