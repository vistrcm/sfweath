...New AVIATION, MARINE...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 840 PM PDT Wed Sep 13 2023

Seasonally warm conditions will continue across the inland areas
through Thursday, with a cooling trend developing for Friday into
the weekend. Meanwhile, low clouds and fog linger along the
immediate coast, helping to moderate temperatures there. Some
drizzle will also be possible along the coast during the late
night and early morning hours.

&&

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 1233 AM PDT Thu Sep 14 2023

Extensive stratus coverage along the entire coastline, and flowing
inland to the Sonoma Valley, through the Golden Gate into Berkeley
and north into the Napa Valley, and around Monterey Bay, across the
Morgan Hill-Hollister corridor, and down the Salinas Valley. More
stratus coverage is expected through the night, clearing out in the
inland areas through the morning while coastal areas remain cloudy
throughout the day. A deep marine layer of 1500-2000 feet is also
expected to persist, resulting in the chance of drizzle along the
coast. The cloud cover will moderate coastal high temperatures,
which will remain in the 60s, while the Bayshore should expect highs
in the mid to upper 70s, and interior valleys reaching into the mid
to upper 80s with the most interior locations rising to the low 90s.
Breezy onshore winds develop in the afternoon, with gusts as high as
20 to 25 miles per hour in favored passes and gaps before
diminishing in the evening.

&&

.LONG TERM...
(Friday through Wednesday)
Issued at 1233 AM PDT Thu Sep 14 2023

A closed upper low will evolve off the CA coast on Friday. The low
should pinwheel offshore through the weekend before rejoining the
westerlies thereafter. This will happen in concert with a
deepening trough from the Pacific Northwest through the Great
Basin towards mid week. Expect a cooling temperature trend into
the weekend with the troughing pattern maintaining a relatively
deep marine layer. While measurable precipitation appears unlikely
can`t rule out some coastal drizzle during the overnights and
mornings. Winds should be generally moist and onshore through
Wednesday. Thereafter the pattern favors the potential for a
northerly (drying) wind in the North Bay hills on Wednesday night.
Right now this wind doesn`t appear overly strong but we`ll
continue to monitor trends.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 433 AM PDT Thu Sep 14 2023

IFR-LIFR stratus across the region and through all but the most
interior of valleys. Stratus clears from the inland areas around 17-
18Z, while MVFR ceilings remain at the coastal areas through the
day. Breezy northwest flow develops during the afternoon with speeds
up to 10-15 knots. Stratus starts to return through the evening with
the largest coverage after the end of the 24-hour TAF period.

Vicinity of SFO... A "sucker hole" has developed over the terminal,
making an accurate forecast difficult as previous experience has
shown that the hole could keep the terminal clear hours after the
approach path clouds over. Tonight however, it appears that the
stratus has flowed over the terminal and the TAF is now updated to
reflect this. The stratus should clear around 17-18Z, with breezy
northwest winds developing in the afternoon with gusts up to
18-20 knots. Stratus returns to the terminal after midnight and
dissipates again Friday morning.

SFO Bridge Approach... Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals... IFR-LIFR continues through the night with
inland areas clearing near 17-18Z. Model guidance is split on MRY
clearing out later today, but the guidance is leaning towards MVFR
ceilings from the late morning to the early evening. Breezy west to
northwest flow develops in the afternoon with speeds up to 8-12
knots. Stratus returns quite early with IFR-LIFR ceilings expected
overnight.

.MARINE...
(Today through Tuesday)
Issued at 433 AM PDT Thu Sep 14 2023

Gusty northwesterly winds over the northern outer waters continue
to diminish to become moderate to fresh later this morning, and
persisting through the weekend. Meanwhile, light southerly swell
continues to traverse the region, in addition to light northerly
swell with a moderate period around 11 seconds. Longer period
southerly swell around 16-18 seconds continues through the waters
as well. Chances of rain appear over the far northern outer waters
towards the weekend.

.MTR WATCHES/WARNINGS/ADVISORIES...

PZ...Small Craft Advisory until 9 AM PDT this morning for PZZ570.
