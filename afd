...New UPDATE, MARINE...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 309 AM PDT Sun May 18 2025

Another gusty day today with NW winds 30-40 mph. Elevated fire
weather concerns for far interior areas late tonight and early
Monday with a brief burst of offshore winds. Winds begin to
diminish Monday evening with a warm and dry trend through the rest
of the week.

.UPDATE...
Issued at 912 AM PDT Sun May 18 2025

What a difference 24 hours makes with sensible weather to start
your Sunday. Wall to wall sunshine this morning across the Bay
Area and Central Coast. Increased insolation has led to slightly
warmer temperatures this morning and expecting warmer temperatures
this afternoon too. Winds on the other hand a much weaker this
morning with a few areas reporting calm conditions. Don`t be
fooled by the less windy start. Still expecting winds to increase
again this afternoon. The SFO-ACV pressure gradient will be a big
driver for the winds. Currently the gradient is -5.8 mb, but
expected to increase to over -7 mb.

No update needed at this time.

Enjoy the Sunday weather, but be prepared for breezy to gusty
winds this afternoon.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 309 AM PDT Sun May 18 2025

Large scale subsidence on the back side of the trough, now located
over the Great Basin, is leading to mostly clear skies and the
subtle redevelopment of a stable marine layer thanks to
compressional heating aloft. Very strong onshore surface pressure
gradient today resulted in wind gusts of 30 to 40 mph, with a few
locations up to 50 to 55 mph. This gradient has since weakened as
the surface low moves well inland into the high desert southwest.
Strong northwest flow aloft will likely mix down this afternoon
for another windy day through this evening before decoupling again
overnight along coastal and coastal adjacent areas.

.LONG TERM...
(Monday through Saturday)
Issued at 309 AM PDT Sun May 18 2025

Through early Monday morning, the surface pressure gradient reverses
to become lightly offshore as high pressure builds over the PNW. The
result will be winds veering to a more northerly component during
the overnight hours, leading to a drier airmass and gusty conditions
continuing across interior areas that will likely not see any marine
layer decoupling. Far interior areas of the North Bay through the
Central Coast will see dry conditions with daytime RH in the 20-25%
range. A lighter degree of offshore winds Monday morning has
resulted in the RH recovery forecast improving slightly. So
basically we are still looking at a period of elevated fire
weather concerns Monday, but we aren`t looking any `worse`. After
a couple of grass fires ignited today, concerns are reinforced
that grasses and fine fuels are ripe to burn. Beyond the winds,
breezy conditions remain for coastal areas, but the winds largely
diminish by Monday evening. A warm and dry pattern is on tap for
the rest of the week with far interior areas inching up towards
moderate HeatRisk for Wednesday as temperatures rise above
seasonal normals.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 349 AM PDT Sun May 18 2025

Currently MVFR-VFR at the terminals. Offshore winds are eroding
stratus along the San Francisco Peninsula Coast and in the East Bay
Hills with stratus expected to remain at the Monterey Bay terminals
through late-morning. Northerly (drying) flow will allow
widespread VFR to prevail through the TAF period by this
afternoon. Westerly/northwesterly wind gusts of 20-30 knots are
expected through the afternoon and evening.

Vicinity of SFO...Currently VFR and calm. High confidence in VFR and
westerly winds prevailing through the TAF period.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...Currently MVFR with westerly flow at both
terminals. High confidence in VFR and westerly winds prevailing
through the TAF period by late-morning, with MRY winds backing to
become southwesterly late tonight.

.MARINE...
(Today through Friday)
Issued at 912 AM PDT Sun May 18 2025

Near gale northerly breezes with severe gale are expected, with
storm force gusts expected for the northern waters later this
afternoon. Hazardous marine conditions will persist Monday
through Thursday with strong northerly breezes with near gale
force gusts and rough to very rough seas.
