...New SYNOPSIS, SHORT TERM, LONG TERM, AVIATION, MARINE...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 310 AM PST Wed Jan 8 2025

Gusty offshore winds continue across the region, beginning to
lessen gradually by this afternoon. Additional gusty winds
possible Saturday and early next week with quiet weather in
between.

&&

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 310 AM PST Wed Jan 8 2025

Another morning of gusty NE winds across the region. Overall very
similar to yesterday morning with current gusts in the 60-70 mph
range in the highest peaks (Mt. St. Helena), and the 40-50 mph
range near Mt Diablo. Winds will continue through this morning
before gradually diminishing this afternoon as the responsible
upper low moves south and the pressure gradient over central CA
relaxes. Some of the higher terrain in the interior North Bay
could still see gusts to 40 mph tonight, but winds should be much
more tame across the rest of the Bay Area before sunset. For now,
keeping the Wind Advisory with the same expiration time of 10 AM
this morning.

.LONG TERM...
(Thursday through Tuesday)
Issued at 310 AM PST Wed Jan 8 2025

Occasional gusty NE winds will likely linger into Thursday for the
high terrain. As the upper low over SoCal finally moves out into
Mexico/southern US, a more robust ridge takes over the pattern and
promotes quiet and slightly warmer conditions for Friday. Although
nice temperatures remain through the weekend, several upper level
disturbances are expected to translate into the CONUS from a very
active deep trough pattern over the Bering Sea and a stagnant
ridge over the EPac. This will very likely promote additional
bursts of offshore flow from Saturday through into the early half
of next week as these progressive upper lows back into the SW US
around the periphery of the near-stationary ridge. Some
uncertainty remains regarding the strength of any upcoming wind
event, but there are several hints that this pattern finally
breaks down around the middle of next week, promoting additional
changes in the weather and perhaps a bit of rain in the forecast.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 310 AM PST Wed Jan 8 2025

Gusty offshore winds will begin to ease Wednesday morning, with high
confidence that VFR will persist through the TAF period.

Vicinity of SFO...LLWS can be expected into late Wednesday morning.
Onshore winds will return this afternoon and then return to
light/variable overnight into Thursday morning.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...VFR conditions persist this morning and
will likely continue through the remainder of the TAF period.
Onshore flow returns this afternoon and then return to
light/variable overnight into Thursday morning.

&&

.MARINE...
(Today through Monday)
Issued at 310 AM PST Wed Jan 8 2025

High pressure over the Great Basin will result in periods of
offshore winds across the bays and coastal waters through late
Thursday night. On Friday the high pressure system weakens while a
low pressure trough moves eastward across the Pacific Northwest.
Surface high pressure then rebuilds over the Great Basin during
the weekend. This will bring a return of offshore winds to the
bays and coastal waters over the weekend. Seas and gusty north
winds gradually abate during the remainder of the week then
increase again over the weekend.

.MTR WATCHES/WARNINGS/ADVISORIES...

     504>506-508>510-512-514-515.
