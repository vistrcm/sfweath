...New SYNOPSIS, UPDATE, MARINE...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 955 AM PDT Tue Sep 3 2024

High pressure will begin to build over the region today, with dry
and warmer conditions prevailing. A moderate heat risk will
develop across San Francisco today, with a Heat Advisory now in
effect for the city. The inland and mountains areas will warm
significantly on Wednesday and Thursday, with temperatures
ranging between 10 and 20 degrees above normal across the inland
areas. Therefore, a Heat Advisory will go into effect for
Wednesday and Thursday. A gradual cooling trend will develop for
Friday and the weekend as another trough digs along the West
Coast.

.UPDATE...
Issued at 955 AM PDT Tue Sep 3 2024

Beautiful water vapor imagery shows a complex pattern across the
West this morning, with an upper level low moving across Eastern
Oregon, with the deformation zone draped over the I-80 corridor, and
an upper level disturbance centered near 35 North and -129.5 West.
Water vapor imagery also shows a slug of very dry air spread into
Northern California north of the deformation zone. As a result,
skies are predominately clear this morning, with a weak offshore
gradient prevailing. In fact, our inland North and East Bay
mountains have been seeing gusts in the 25 to 35 mph range this
morning, with humidities falling to between 10 and 25 percent.
These drying winds will elevate some fire weather concerns.
However, we are not anticipating the during to last long enough to
warrant a Red Flag Warning for today.

This weak offshore gradient will also aid in the warming today,
particularly for the bay shore side of San Francisco.
Temperatures there is a 90 percent probability that the City will
exceed 80 degrees today, with a 63 percent of them exceeding 85
degrees. Therefore, expecting a moderate risk risk for eastern and
especially southeastern portion of the city. If the hot spots in
the city exceed 85 degrees, this would push them into a major risk
risk. Therefore, have issued a Heat advisory for San Francisco
today. Will need to watch temperatures and the marine layer
closely today, as a moderate heat risk could potentially extend
into tomorrow as well, depending on what the marine layer does.

The marine layer has redeveloped along the immediate coast this
morning for areas from Half Moon Bay southward to Big Sur. That
being said, it has not expanded into the Monterey Bay, and may not
given the more northerly to slight northeasterly direction.
Therefore, expect inland areas to see a warm up today, the
temperatures ranging between 5 and 15 degrees above normal for
most locations. Places along the immediate coast, like Half Moon
Bay, will be more moderated by the marine air. Palmer

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 304 AM PDT Tue Sep 3 2024

High pressure building into place has already begun to warm and dry
some locations this morning, especially in the higher elevations.
Temperatures will generally be 5 to 15 degrees above normal with the
return of widespread moderate HeatRisk for areas away from the
coast. Interior locations will reach near critical fire weather
conditions this morning due to poor relative humidity recoveries
and light northerly/offshore flow.

&&

.LONG TERM...
(Wednesday through Monday)
Issued at 304 AM PDT Tue Sep 3 2024

For areas away from the coast, maximum temperatures will generally
be 10-20 degrees above normal Wednesday and Thursday. The interior
Central Coast has the potential to remain 10-20 degrees above normal
Friday as well so depending how the forecast evolves the Heat
Advisory may need to be extended into Friday for this area.
Elsewhere, a gradual cooling trend will begin Friday as troughing
takes shape off the West Coast. Near critical fire weather
conditions will persist through at least Friday morning due to poor
relative humidity recoveries and light northerly/offshore flow
during the overnight and morning hours.

Now onto the more uncertain part of the forecast. A shortwave has
the potential to swing through the area on Friday posing a low
probability/high impact scenario due to hot and dry antecedent
conditions. At this time the atmosphere in our area does not look to
stack up in terms of instability and moisture with thunderstorm
activity remaining confined to the north and east of our area.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 452 AM PDT Tue Sep 3 2024

VFR conditions continue to prevail at all terminals early this
morning. Low stratus has developed south of the Bay Area and just
offshore of Monterey Bay, but has been slow to spread toward the
coastline. Fort Ord profiler shows the marine layer starting to
gradually deepen early this morning, with low stratus expected to
eventually increase in coverage over KMRY and KSNS.

Vicinity of SFO...Low stratus ceilings seem less likely to impact
ceilings at KSFO and KOAK with more robust development and
coverage occuring south of the Bay Area terminals.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...VFR conditions continue early this
morning with an area of low stratus clouds beginning to develop
and increase in coverage just offshore of Monterey Bay, streaming
south into the Big Sur area. The Fort Ord profiler shows the
marine layer currently expanding which should increase chances for
low stratus to spread eastward from open water, impacting
ceilings over KMRY and KSNS over the next few hours, eventually
clearing back to VFR by later morning.

.MARINE...
Issued at 835 AM PDT Tue Sep 3 2024

Northerly winds will become fairly calm by the end of today.
Occasional fresh gusts are possible across the Golden Gate and
throughout the San Francisco Bay beginning this afternoon and
evening but conditions are not currently expected to meet small
craft advisory criteria. Rough seas with significant wave heights
between 5 to 7 feet continue through mid week before seas begin to
abate.

     Heat Advisory from 11 AM Wednesday to 11 PM PDT Thursday for
