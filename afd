...New AVIATION, MARINE...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 334 AM PDT Sun Jun 22 2025

Winds will continue to ease and reduce today. Quiet weather on tap
for the upcoming week, with the return of coastal clouds and fog.
Temperatures gradually return to near normal, especially for inland
areas.

&&

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 334 AM PDT Sun Jun 22 2025

Quiet weather on tap, with winds continuing to ease throughout the
day. The upper level low from the Intermountain West continues to
lift to the north-northeast, with a secondary low developing over
Northern CA while an upper level high sits over the eastern Pacific.
This should allow stratus to inch closer coast throughout the day,
potentially hugging our coast by Sunday night. The question becomes
whether or not the first push of stratus makes it inland at all.
Guidance supports it seeping into around Monterey Bay and perhaps
along the San Mateo/San Francisco coast. Will need to keep an eye on
how this trends throughout the day.

.LONG TERM...
(Monday through Saturday)
Issued at 334 AM PDT Sun Jun 22 2025

More or less of the same is on tap for the extended forecast.
Ensemble and cluster analysis favors upper level troughing to quasi
zonal flow. This means fairly quiet weather will continue, with
mainly onshore flow, and coastal stratus and perhaps nighttime fog
at times. Temperatures gradually warm throughout the period,

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 412 AM PDT Sun Jun 22 2025

Currently VFR at the terminals. High confidence in VFR prevailing at
least until tonight. A passing upper-level shortwave trough will
likely lead to the return of IFR/MVFR stratus tonight to the coastal
terminals of HAF, MRY, and SNS. Onshore winds will prevail through
the TAF period.

Vicinity of SFO...Currently VFR with westerly flow. High confidence
in VFR and westerly winds prevailing through the TAF period.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...Currently VFR with easterly flow at MRY and
VFR and calm at SNS. Sub-VFR ceilings will return to the terminals
tonight. Westerly winds will prevail through the TAF period.

&&

.MARINE...
(Today through Friday)
Issued at 412 AM PDT Sun Jun 22 2025

Widespread hazardous marine conditions continue for the waters
with strong northwesterly breezes, gale force gusts, and rough
seas. Conditions improve Monday, but northwesterly breezes will
still remain fresh to strong and seas will still remain moderate
to rough through Thursday.
