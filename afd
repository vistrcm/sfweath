.UPDATE...
Issued at 655 AM PDT Wed Sep 24 2025

Ample shower activity has been observed across Monterey and San
Benito counties this morning, with some strong thunderstorms in
the southern portion of these counties. Rainfall has been steady,
but hasn`t brought a flooding concern over the dry soil. The
thunderstorms have been strong. A couple RAWS sites in western
Fresno county recorded thunderstorm outflow wind gusts of 50+ mph
prior to 7 AM. This makes sense as the high LCL combined with
evaporating rain helps bring higher momentum air down to the
surface. Sub-hourly HRRR data shows the shower activity will
gradually shift north through the morning hours, moving out of
Monterey County by noon or so. Activity should taper off in the
Bay Area, and the drier low levels will make it harder for much
rain to reach the ground. That said, there is still a slight
chance for lightning, particularly across the East Bay. With the
lack of rain, any dry lightning strikes bring a chance for
wildfire ignition. While the main show is this morning, the
chance for showers and thunderstorms continues through Thursday
morning as the upper level low gradually shifts SE and the
moisture goes with it.

.SHORT TERM...
Issued at 215 AM PDT Wed Sep 24 2025
(Today and tonight)

Showers and thunderstorms are slowly streaming in from the southeast
this morning. Webcams around Monterey County have show rain falling
with thunderstorms and a few observation sites, if they were hit,
have shown some accumulation. The 6Z special sounding that we
launched, shows PWATs near 1.12 inches at KOAK, which matches the
gradient on the SPC mesoanalysis page. As you travel south on the
map, the gradient goes from 1.10 to about 1.40-1.60", highest over
Central Coast. To the north and north east of KOAK, the gradient is
about 0.8-1.10" with the lower values found over Napa and Sonoma
counties. Thunderstorms, and associated lightning, around the
Central Coast should be wet. In the Bay Area, there is a bit more
uncertainty with wetting rains. The 6Z sounding depicted a massive
dry layer to over come and it will be interesting to see any chances
with the 12Z balloon. Should that hold, any thunderstorms that pop
up in the Bay Area would be drier, whereas moistening could support
some rain with thunder and lightning.

In terms of the thunderstorms, confidence remains the greatest along
the Central Coast for the rest of today. Confidence decrease the
more north you go, with the lowest confidence for thunderstorms
being over the North Bay. Impacts from today`s stronger showers or
thunderstorms include gusty winds in excess of 35mph and lightning.
The dry lightning threat remains the greatest over the East Bay and
southern portions of the North Bay.

.LONG TERM...
Issued at 215 AM PDT Wed Sep 24 2025
(Thursday through Tuesday)

A brief period of upper level ridging will nose into the region for
the late portion of the week, which will bring an uptick in
temperatures to the region. Friday will be the warmest day, with
most areas along the Central Coast and San Francisco Peninsula being
near normal for this time of year. For the rest of the Bay Area,
temperatures will be about 5 to 15 degrees above normal. Cooler and
more seasonal weather returns for the weekend. Guidance continues to
hint at another chance for rain early next week via a cold front,
though uncertainty remains on timing and strength.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 451 AM PDT Wed Sep 24 2025

Scattered showers are moving into the region from the south with a
few storms affecting the Monterey Bay terminals. Shower activity
spreads north through the day with slight chances for storms
embedded in lines of showers. Lower CIGs affect STS for the first
half of the morning before dissipating as showers approach. Cloud
bases for the showers look to stay 4000 to 5000ft AGL, and only
offer limited reductions in visibilities. Shower chances reduce in
the late night, but don`t fully exit the region until mid Thursday
morning. Lower CIGs will arrive on the coast and around the Monterey
Bay early Thursday morning.

Vicinity of SFO...Scattered showers arrive in the late morning with
more consistent shower activity expected into the afternoon. Slight
chances for storms will be possible within these lines of showers.
Rain chances decrease into the night and finally exit into late
Thursday morning.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...Passing showers and a few storms have been
affecting the Monterey Bay terminals through much of the night and
into the morning. Shower and storm chances look to increase slightly
into the mid morning. Shower activity becomes more scattered into
the afternoon and rain chances look to exit into the evening for the
Monterey Bay. MVFR/IFR CIGs build into the late night and into early
Thursday.

.MARINE...
(Today through Monday)
Issued at 215 AM PDT Wed Sep 24 2025

Scattered showers and thunderstorms are building over the
southern waters and will steadily move northward across the
waters and bays through Wednesday. Thunderstorms will pose the
risk of gusty outflow winds, locally rough seas and locally very
heavy rain. Winds increase to a fresh breeze by the end of the
week. Moderate seas will prevail through Wednesday, building to
become rough in the outer waters Thursday into Friday.

&&

.FIRE WEATHER...
Issued at 715 AM PDT Wed Sep 24 2025

Thunderstorms across the Central Coast will continue to push
north into the Bay Area through the day. While the chance for
lightning decreases in the Bay Area, any storms that form will
produce much less rain, leading to a chance for dry lightning
strikes. The latest model guidance suggests this threat is
highest across the East Bay in the early afternoon.
