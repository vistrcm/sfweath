...New UPDATE, MARINE...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 216 AM PDT Mon Apr 15 2024

Drier weather to persist. A warming trend is expected through the
first half of the work week.

&&

.UPDATE...
Issued at 835 AM PDT Mon Apr 15 2024

Patchy to areas of fog remain over the North Bay this morning but
conditions are showing signs of improvement as of this writing.
Elsewhere, a mix of MVFR to clear sky conditions with low clouds
anticipated to mix out throughout the late morning. The forecast
remains on track for the remainder of the day with no changes
anticipated at this time.

&&

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 216 AM PDT Mon Apr 15 2024

Showers have moved out of the area with dry conditions expected
through the forecast period. The 00Z KOAK sounding shows a fairly
stable atmosphere in the wake of our departing low pressure system
with guidance indicating weak surface winds and high RH values are
expected overnight. As such, there is an increased likelihood for
patchy fog to develop overnight and last through the mid-morning. At
this time areas of fog are likely to remain isolated and not meet
dense fog criteria.

Near normal morning lows in the 40`s for most areas with some areas
in wind sheltered spots and higher elevations dipping into the upper
30`s. High temperatures on Monday will be fairly seasonal with
locations along the coast in the upper 50`s and locations inland in
the mid to upper 60`s. A few locations even look to potentially peak
in the lower 70`s. This kicks off a warming trend as high pressure
builds over the West Coast with morning lows on Tuesday expected to
be in the mid to upper 40`s and high temperatures in the 60`s along
the coast and in the 70`s inland.

&&

.LONG TERM...
(Tuesday through Sunday)
Issued at 216 AM PDT Mon Apr 15 2024

Looking ahead to mid-week, warmer, drier weather reigns as ridging
builds in from the west. A warming trend will begin mid-week with
Wednesday and Thursday looking to be the warmest days. Inland highs
will reach the mid to upper 70`s and a few locations may reach the
low 80`s. Moving into Friday temperatures will cool down slightly to
the upper 60`s to mid 70`s as upper level ridging becomes more zonal
and allows for increased onshore flow.

High pressure will keep precipitation pushed northward of the Bay
Area with the CPC highlighting below average precipitation for next
6-10 days. Ensemble guidance indicates that unsettled weather may
return towards the end of April but as of now confidence remains
low.
