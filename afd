...New AVIATION...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 306 AM PDT Tue Oct 29 2024

Cooler morning temperatures and dry conditions expected today
before rain chances return again Wednesday through the end of the
week.

&&

.UPDATE...
Issued at 851 AM PDT Tue Oct 29 2024

Clear skies and decreasing winds overnight night led to a chilly
start to the day. Lots of temperatures in the 40s this morning
for lows, but if you move to far interior locations or away from
urban centers temperatures dropped into the 30s. Wouldn`t be
surprised if a few people had to turn their heat on this morning.
No update needed for the near term. All in all, today will be one
of the last relatively quiet days over the next 5-7 day. Mostly
sunny skies expected with highs topping out in the upper 50s to
lower 70s, which is seasonably cool for late October.

One other item of note this morning for you weather watchers out
there, a little band of lake effect snow is flowing off Lake
Tahoe. Our colleagues at WFO Reno issued a Winter Weather
Advisory for areas near Emerald Bay with up to three inches
possible. Winter is coming....

Much more active weather expected down the road. Afternoon
forecast will fine tune two round of rain followed by offshore
flow late next week.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 306 AM PDT Tue Oct 29 2024

Showers have largely ended over our CWA with drier conditions
prevailing through the rest of today. So how did we do? Well, over
the last 24 hours many sites across the Bay Area and interior
Central Coast saw at least a few hundredths of an inch. There were a
few outliers in the North Bay which saw slightly higher totals
between 0.1"-0.18" of rain. Even San Jose, famously impacted by rain
shadowing from the Santa Cruz mountains, recorded 0.01" at the San
Jose International Airport making it the rainiest day since May for
the city.

Tuesday will be the driest day of the week as short wave ridging
moves into the West Coast and brings with it a much drier airmass.
The advection of drier air inland will reduce the development of
cloud cover across the region and contribute to both a steep cooling
of our morning lows and a slight warming of our afternoon highs. At
night, cloud cover can act as a form of "insulation" trapping heat
at the surface. If no cloud cover is present heat will be able to
rise (i.e. escape) and temperatures will be able to cool at a much
faster rate. This effect will be particularly important across the
North Bay tonight where satellite imagery confirms that no cloud
cover is present. While temperatures are currently in the upper 40s
to low 50s, this lack of cloud cover will contribute to increased
radiational cooling and allow temperatures to drop into the upper
30s to low 40s this morning. During the day, we expect to see high
temperatures about 1 to 3 degrees warmer than they were yesterday.
However, this will not result in any major changes to the overall
highs with inland areas still seeing temperatures in the mid to
upper 60s and coastal areas in the upper 50s to low 60s. The one
thing to keep in mind is that gusty northwest winds are expected to
continue through late this morning which may result in temperatures
outside feeling cooler than they actually are. As this will be one
of the chilliest mornings we`ve had all Fall, consider taking a
sturdier jacket out with you on any morning errands. For those
unenthused by dry weather, read on to the long term to learn more
about our next chances for rain.

.LONG TERM...
(Wednesday through Monday)
Issued at 306 AM PDT Tue Oct 29 2024

Temperatures will remain cool through the week with highs generally
in the 60s across the interior and in the upper 50s to low 60s along
the coast. Morning low temperatures will gradually start to warm up
by late week but highs will generally stay in the 40s to low 50s
while the coldest sites will remain in the upper 30s to low 40s.
Despite shortwave ridging Tuesday, the storm door remains open with
a series of progressive upper level troughs expected to move through
the West Coast this week. Wednesday, the next upper level trough and
surface low pressure system will move into the Pacific Northwest and
bring with it widespread light rain to the Bay Area and to coastal
portions of the Central Coast. Rain chances increase Wednesday
afternoon across the North Bay and gradually increase across the
rest of the Bay Area and the Central Coast Wednesday evening into
Thursday morning as the surface based cold front progresses
southward. The highest totals continue to be in the North Bay (0.2"-
0.3") but coastal areas along the San Francisco peninsula may see
accumulations of up to 0.15" of rain. Across the East Bay, South
Bay, and Central Coast totals will generally be less than 0.1"
inches. Showers will gradually tapper off by late Thursday morning
but drizzly conditions are expected to persist into Thursday
evening, adding to the spooky ambiance of the day. While some
uncertainty remains, confidence has continued to increase that upper
level troughing will deepen over the West Coast Friday into Saturday
and provide more widespread rainfall to the region. NBM QPF guidance
has continued to trend upwards with between 0.25" to 0.3" expected
across the majority of the area. Areas where upslope flow is favored
(coastal North Bay Mountains, Santa Cruz Mountains, Santa Lucia
Mountains) may see locally higher amounts closer to half an inch.

By late weekend, drier conditions are expected to return with
cluster guidance suggesting another "inside slider" type pattern may
develop. By Sunday, upper level troughing will have deepened and
moved farther souther into California. The European and Canadian
models both show a cut off low developing over the California-
Arizona border while ridging starts to build back in along the
coast. This would result in a prime setup for offshore
(northeasterly) winds to develop across our region. While it remains
uncertain as to how long this setup will persist, both ensemble and
CPC guidance indicates that we will see a return to warmer and drier
conditions during early November. While we are still a week out,
this setup is something to keep an eye on as it may bring elevated
fire weather concerns back to our CWA.

.AVIATION...
(18Z TAFS)
Issued at 1001 AM PDT Tue Oct 29 2024

VFR throughout the region today with breezy onshore winds through
the afternoon and evening. High clouds start to move into the region
overnight in advance of a cold front, with some patchy stratus
possible in the higher elevations and near Monterey Bay. Near and
beyond the end of the TAF period, winds shift to the southwest with
developing MVFR ceilings as the cold front approaches.

Vicinity of SFO... VFR with high clouds moving in tonight through
the end of the TAF period. Breezy west-northwest winds gusting to 20
knots develop this afternoon and evening, with the winds shifting to
the southwest with the approaching cold front on Wednesday.

SFO Bridge Approach... Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals... Model output shows some chance (around 30-
40% probability) for MVFR-IFR stratus along the coast, otherwise
moderate to high confidence of VFR conditions through the TAF
period. Breezy northwest flow develops this afternoon and evening,
with high clouds coming in overnight.

.MARINE...
(Today through Sunday)
Issued at 836 AM PDT Tue Oct 29 2024

Winds will continue to diminish and seas will subside through the

building winds back to a fresh northwest breeze and reintroducing
rough seas through the day Thursday and into Friday.
