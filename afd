...New AVIATION, MARINE...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 148 AM PDT Tue Sep 12 2023

Highs slightly cooler than yesterday, with breezy west winds
expected during the afternoon. Little change in sensible weather
through the rest of the week.

&&

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 148 AM PDT Tue Sep 12 2023

Nighttime satellite imagery reveals a band of coastal stratus from
the Marin County coastline southward to the Big Sur coast, with
stratus flowing over San Francisco and northern San Mateo County
to the East Bay, and expanding across the Monterey Bay region
and down into the Salinas Valley south to Bradley. A patch of
stratus has also formed across the Napa Valley, and is expected to
form in the Sonoma Valley later tonight. Stratus is expected to
clear for most through the morning hours, with the coastal areas
of western San Mateo County and the southern Monterey Bay clearing
out last, if at all.

High temperatures today should be slightly cooler than yesterday.
The largest changes will be across the interior valleys, where
temperatures will generally rise into the 80s with the most
interior places seeing temperatures in the low 90s. Low to mid 70s
are expected across the Bayshore while the Pacific coast should
see temperatures rise to the mid 60s to low 70s. Breezy westerly
winds should develop in the afternoon, with winds as high as 15-20
miles per hour. The dry cold front over northern California is
now expected to move more towards the east, with the immediate
result of lesser disruption to the marine layer, especially to the
south of the North Bay. Thus, expecting more or less similar
development of stratus coverage this evening.

.LONG TERM...
(Wednesday through Monday)
Issued at 117 AM PDT Tue Sep 12 2023

An upper trough will progress through the Great Basin on Wednesday.
It may bring some breeziness and drier conditions to the North/East
Bay hills on Wednesday but otherwise not much in the way of local
impacts expected from its passage. Shortwave ridging will encompass
the region thereafter through late week with a bit of inland warming
and marine layer compression. The pattern transitions towards
eastern Pacific troughing by early next week with onshore flow,
cooler temperatures, and a deepening marine layer.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 427 AM PDT Tue Sep 12 2023

Generally IFR stratus exists across the coastline and extending
quite far inland, with stratus flowing into the Napa and Sonoma
Valleys, the East Bay, and the Salinas Valley. Some additional
stratus development is expected for the rest of the night, clearing
after sunrise except at the immediate coast of the San Mateo
Peninsula and the southern Monterey Bay. Breezy westerly flow
develops in the afternoon with wind speeds up to 10-15 knots at the
terminals. Stratus builds back this evening, with more or less the
same pattern of inland development seen tonight.

Vicinity of SFO... Just as the terminal looked to be socked in, the
edge of the stratus retreated to the north, just enough that the
terminal is now reporting SCT for the last few hours. With the
stratus deck on the edge of the terminal and satellite imagery
hinting at a southward push, have kept an IFR ceiling through the
morning. Similar thinking applies to OAK. West-northwest winds for
the day, gusting up to 20 knots, with a moderate confidence for
stratus developing over the terminal in the evening hours.

SFO Bridge Approach... Lower confidence in stratus development
for the rest of tonight and this evening. Otherwise similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals... IFR-LIFR through the night. Stratus clears
from SNS through the morning. As for MRY, the thinking from earlier
tonight still applies -- Main question is how late and low long MRY
will clear out for. Model guidance showing a low confidence (20-30%
probability) that MVFR ceilings remain through the day. For now,
have kept the TAF intact with a brief period of clearing on Tuesday
afternoon.

Breezy west-northwest winds will develop through the day, with
speeds up to 10 knots. MVFR-IFR stratus will redevelop in the
evening and persist through the end of the TAF period.

.MARINE...
(Today through Sunday)
Issued at 427 AM PDT Tue Sep 12 2023

Gusty northwest winds continue across the waters through the
middle of the week, creating hazardous conditions for small craft.
Occasional gale force gusts are possible in the northern waters
this afternoon and evening. A new northwesterly swell at around
11 seconds is expected to arrive later today. Current southerly
swell continues to diminish through the week while wind wave
heights gradually increase. A new lighter, long period southerly
swell train arrives midweek.
