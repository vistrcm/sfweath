...New SHORT TERM, LONG TERM, AVIATION, MARINE, BEACHES...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 155 PM PST Sat Mar 1 2025

Wet weather returns later tonight and continues into next work
week. While rain chances are forecast nearly each day, there will
be periods of dry conditions. Overall, rain amounts are NOT
anticipated to result in widespread or significant impacts,
however, wet commutes and cooler conditions are probable.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 346 AM PST Sun Mar 2 2025


Scattered light showers continue to move through the area as the low
pressure moves inland. Keeping an eye on satellite and regional
radar (because KMUX is unfortunately still having issues), there are
some indicators of thunderstorm activity in the marine zones.
However these cells have been losing strength as they approach the
shore, but still have been producing moments of locally moderate to
heavy rain.

The rest of Sunday will see off and on rain chances from passing
showers, with a particular focus on the Big Sur Coast. Thunderstorm
chances will shift from the marine zones to Monterey and San Benito
Counties, with some chances also possible in the East Bay Hills.
These chances peak around 20% in the early afternoon before passing
into the Central Valley. Rain chances finally exit into early Monday
with additional rain totals from this morning through Monday morning
staying on the light side for the interior and more northern
locations. For that same time frame, additional rain adds up to
0.05" to 0.15" for most areas, around 0.30" in the Santa Cruz
Mountains, and 0.40" to 0.80" for the Santa Lucias.

.LONG TERM...
(Monday through Saturday)
Issued at 346 AM PST Sun Mar 2 2025

Dry weather returns Monday afternoon, but it doesn`t last as another
rain-maker arrives Tuesday. There has been some back and forth with
the timing and focus of this next event between recent model updates.

Model trends have been reducing the overall strength of the cold
front, leading to more modest initial rainfall. However, the
trailing plum of moisture looks to get picked up by the front`s
parent low, and pushed into the Central Coast Tuesday night into
Wednesday as the low center moves across the SF Bay, offering more
scattered rains for that area.

What does that mean? Mostly a meteorologist that was adjusting the
forecast tonight getting too far into the weeds with different model
outputs. But also that the Tuesday through Thursday rains will be
widespread and add up fairly well.

As of the current forecast, the Tues-Thurs rains add up to:

0.25" 0.50" for the Bay Area
0.50" to 1" for the San Mateo Coast and
Monterey and San Benito Counties
1" plus for the Santa Cruz Mts and
Santa Lucias.

As mentioned in previous discussions, there is still some lingering
variability in the mid to long term forecast, so these numbers can
still see some changes. Be sure to keep checking back in.

Monterey Bay Terminals...Currently VFR with southwesterly flow at
both terminals. VFR through the TAF period with the exception of

.BEACHES...
Issued at 341 AM PST Sat Mar 1 2025

Hazardous beach and marine conditions are expected through Monday
due to building long period westerly swell supporting breaking waves
up to 20 feet. This will be both a beachgoer and a mariner threat.
Everyone should remain out of the water due to life-threatening surf
conditions. Stay off of jetties, piers, and other waterside
infrastructure, keep pets on a leash and away from the water, and
never turn your back on the ocean!
