...New AVIATION...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 115 AM PDT Mon Sep 11 2023

A dry, weak cold front will move across the Bay Area this evening
into Tuesday morning, which will bring breezier westerly winds
and will mix out the marine layer. Slightly cooler temperatures
expected Tuesday. Stratus will redevelop midweek and then not much
day to day change with sensible weather through the weekend.

&&

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 115 AM PDT Mon Sep 11 2023

Current nighttime satellite imagery shows coastal stratus
redevelopment across the waters as well as a patch of fog
beginning to develop near Moss Landing. Coastal profilers indicate
that the marine layer is around 1000 feet tonight. However,
looking like it will be hard for low clouds to form inland due to
stronger northerly gradient helping the area dry (24 hour RH
change ranging from 10-25% drier across the region currently).
According to hi-res guidance, patchy fog guidance should stay
localized to the northern Monterey Bay region.

Should be a nice day today with seasonable temperatures in the
mid 80s to low 90s inland while temperatures at the coast stay in
the 60s-80s. It will be breezy, however, as a dry, weak cold front
moves through the Bay Area overnight into Tuesday. Guidance shows
the SFO-SAC (onshore) gradient will increase up to +5 mb ahead of
frontal passage, which means onshore winds will be breezy to
gusty across the area tomorrow afternoon into evening. With the
passage of the front, will also help to mix out the marine layer,
consequently wiping out coastal stratus temporarily.

.LONG TERM...
(Tuesday through Sunday)
Issued at 115 AM PDT Mon Sep 11 2023

As a result of cold frontal passage and associated 500 mb
shortwave, temperatures Tuesday will be slightly (2 to 5 degrees)
cooler than today. After the shortwave moves east out of the area
by Wednesday, upper level ridging will start to build in over the
West Coast up into western Canada. With this, can expect very
subtle warming through the end of the work week, but really not
much day to day change. Apex of this upper ridge will shift east
into the weekend, making way for an upper trough to develop over
the offshore waters, which will kickstart another subtle cooling
trend.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 454 AM PDT Mon Sep 11 2023

Nighttime satellite imagery shows increasing stratus coverage
over the waters, but remaining offshore. Patchy fog has developed
over the Monterey Bay region with low clouds spreading down the
Salinas Valley currently. LIFR-IFR conditions will stay localized
to KSNS this morning while VFR persists for KMRY and for SF Bay
Area terminals. Breezy to locally gusty NW winds expected this
afternoon and evening, especially for favorable coastal terminals
such as KSFO. Marine layer will deepen slightly plus a stronger
onshore gradient means better chance for inland low clouds tonight
into Tues morning, but confidence is still low to moderate as it
will depend on how the marine layer responds to incoming dry cold
front overnight.

Vicinity of SFO...VFR will continue through the morning. NW winds
on track to become breezy to gusty this afternoon and evening
with gusts up to 30 kt. Low to moderate confidence for cig
development overnight tonight, so SCT low clouds in taf for now.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...VFR at KMRY and LIFR at KSNS due to
localized fog development overnight. KMRY will likely remain VFR
through the morning, but tempo included for IFR conditions between
13z and 15z. Breezy onshore (NW) winds develop this afternoon.
IFR cigs possible by 03z this evening as stratus deck is expected
to linger close to the coastline through the day today.

.MARINE...
(Tonight through next Friday)
Issued at 513 PM PDT Sun Sep 10 2023

Moderate to fresh northwest winds persist through midweek next
week. Gustier winds will redevelop this afternoon along the
coastal jets, especially south of Point Sur where gale force
winds are expected. Stronger gusts will spread to the outer waters
by early to midweek next week. Southerly swell that originated
from Hurricane Jova will slowly diminish through the week while
wind wave heights will gradually increase.

     evening for PZZ535.
