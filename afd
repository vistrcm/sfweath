...New UPDATE...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 141 AM PDT Sun May 4 2025

Gusty northwest to north winds continue through the day with a Wind
Advisory in effect for the North Bay interior mountains and East Bay
Hills tonight through Monday afternoon. Winds diminish late Monday,
with generally dry and warm conditions through the rest of the
week.

.UPDATE...
Issued at 843 AM PDT Sun May 4 2025

Winds have eased over land with only coastal sites remaining locally
breezy to gusty. Offshore, however, strong winds continue with buoys
continuing to report gusts between 35 to 40 mph. As such, the Wind
Advisory for coastal areas was allowed to expire at 5 AM this
morning. The forecast remains on track with a round of strong
offshore winds expected across the North Bay Interior Mountains and
East Bay Hills tonight into Monday. A Wind Advisory will go into
effect for those zones at 9 PM tonight and expire at 2 PM Monday.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 141 AM PDT Sun May 4 2025

Short Term Key Messages:
- Wind Advisory for portions of the coastal Bay Area and Central
Coast through 5 AM
- Wind Advisory for North Bay interior mountains and East Bay Hills
from 9 PM tonight to 2 PM Monday
- Strong northwest to north winds will continue to diminish, but
remain gusty throughout the region
- Wind gusts reach 35-45 mph in the North Bay interior mountains and
East Bay Hills during the second Wind Advisory

A cutoff low over southern California is crawling eastwards into the
Desert Southwest, relaxing the pressure gradient, turning the winds
towards a more northerly and offshore flow, and allowing for
yesterday`s strong gusts to diminish through the day. Northwesterly
wind gusts of around 20-30 mph are expected today, highest along the
coast and through the gaps and passes. The Wind Advisory currently
in effect for portions of the coastal Bay Area, Central Coast, and
the northern Salinas Valley extends through 5 AM this morning, but
with gusts continuing to diminish since yesterday evening`s peak, we
are confident that we will let the Advisory expire on time.

As the low crawls eastwards, an upper level ridge builds off the
Pacific Northwest, reinforcing the northerly winds and increasing
the wind gusts over the northern regions of the Bay Area. A Wind
Advisory will come into effect at 9 PM tonight, continuing through 2
PM Monday, for the North Bay interior mountains and the East Bay
hills. Winds will gust up to 35-45 mph across the warned area with
the highest ridgelines seeing gusts up to 55 mph. As noted by the
previous forecaster, fire weather concerns will be elevated in the
North Bay, but most fuels (including grasses, shrubs, and trees)
remain moist from the past winter. Residents in the North Bay should
still take care with outdoors stoves and campfires given the strong
northerly winds.

High temperatures today will tick upwards from yesterday`s,
particularly in the interior Bay Area where temperatures could rise
as much as 10 degrees from yesterday`s highs with forecast highs
from the middle to upper 70s. The inland South Bay, Bayside East Bay
and San Mateo Peninsula, and Santa Cruz County should see highs in
the upper 60s to lower 70s, while the Pacific coast including the
Monterey-Salinas region sees highs in the upper 50s to lower 60s.

.LONG TERM...
(Monday through Saturday)
Issued at 141 AM PDT Sun May 4 2025

Long Term Key Messages
- Winds continue to ease through Tuesday
- Ridging pattern continues through the week
- Generally dry and warm

Winds will begin easing late Monday as the cutoff low continues
moving into the southern Great Plains and the upper level ridge
expands eastwards. The ridging pattern continues through the week
with highs reaching the middle 70s to the middle 80s in the inland
valleys, around 5 to 10 degrees above the seasonal average, while
the redevelopment of the marine layer should keep the coastal
regions relatively cooler with highs hovering in the upper 50s to
the middle 60s. CPC outlooks for the 8-14 day period suggest a
period where temperatures will be near the seasonal averages while
precipitation leans above seasonal averages, noting that at this
time of year, a couple of hundredths of an inch of rain in one day
would qualify as seasonally average rainfall.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 526 AM PDT Sun May 4 2025

Mainly VFR conditions prevail across the Bay Area, while VFR to
MVFR cigs can be found along the Monterey Bay region and valleys
of San Benito/Monterey counties. Expect the stratus to eventually
give way later this morning, leaving us with widespread VFR
conditions. Haze conditions from excessive sea spray will affect
HAF through the TAF period. The main story will be gusty north to
northwest winds gradually decreasing through the day before
shifting to the north and northeast. Then the forecast challenge
becomes low level wind shear, especially for terminals in the
greater Bay Area later this evening and into the overnight hours.
The wind shear threat looks falter by mid to late Monday morning.

Vicinity of SFO...VFR conditions are expected at SFO through the
period. The main story will breezy northwest to north winds through
the day. By the evening, offshore flow develops which will lead to
low level wind shear concerns through the overnight hours.
Conditions should start to improve by mid to late Monday morning.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...Stratus hugs the southern portion of the
Monterey Bay area, with stratus snaking through the southern Central
Coast valleys. Expect condition at KSNS and KMRY to hold for a
couple of hours and should erode by late morning. Then VFR
conditions prevail.

&&

.MARINE...
(Today through Friday)
Issued at 245 AM PDT Sun May 4 2025

Storm warnings remain effect for the northern waters as well as
the outer waters off of Pigeon Point to Point Pinos. Elsewhere,
hazardous conditions remain due to strong gusty north to northwest
winds, which are accompanied by widespread rough seas. Winds
diminish and seas reduce into the upcoming work week, but breezy
winds and moderate seas remain hazardous for small craft through
the first half of the work week. Mariners are encouraged to check
the latest conditions before departing port or harbor.

&&

.BEACHES...
Issued at 245 AM PDT Sun May 4 2025

A Beach Hazards Statement remains in effect through Monday
morning for the Monterey County coastline, where breaking waves of
15 to 20 feet are expected with the highest waves reaching 28
feet in favored locations. Elevated surf is also expected along
west and northwest facing beaches towards the north, but with a
slightly shorter period in this region, confidence in hazardous
conditions is somewhat lower. Additionally, gusty winds will cause
blowing and shifting sand, as well as increase sea spray, which
can complicate water rescues due to reduced visibilities.
