...New UPDATE, MARINE...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 226 AM PDT Sun May 11 2025

Unsettled weather returns today and continues into early next week in
the form of strong and gusty onshore winds, light rainfall, below
normal temperatures, and a 10% chance for thunderstorms.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today through Tuesday) Issued at 226 AM PDT Sun May 11 2025

Unsettled weather returns to the region today thanks to an upper-
level low in the Gulf of Alaska. This feature will dig along the
West Coast over the next 24 hours, weakening and becoming an open
wave once it moves inland Monday. While no products or headlines are
anticipated at this time, there`s still plenty to talk about. The
greatest impact will be from the strong and gusty onshore winds. The
strongest winds can be expected in the highest terrain and gaps and
passes, namely Altamont Pass and Pacheco Pass, where gusts of 50mph
are expected. Widespread gusts of 25-35mph can be expected
elsewhere. Strong winds may move loose debris, result in minor
property damage, and cause sporadic power outages. Travel could
become difficult, especially for high profile vehicles. Secure loose
outdoor objects that could be blown around or damaged by the mind.
Cloud cover and rain chances will increase this evening with the
Bay Area and Northern Monterey Bay all on tap to receive
precipitation by tomorrow afternoon. With the help of orographic
lift, higher terrain will receive locally higher amounts with
wetting rains forecast for the North Bay Hills and Mountains as
well as parts of the Santa Cruz Mountains. While not impactful (in
fact it`ll be beneficial as the region recovers from moderate and
minor HeatRisk), temperature whiplash will certainly ensure today
as temperatures will be 20 degrees cooler than they were
yesterday, bottoming out to 10 degrees below normal tomorrow. The
responsible surface low will leave the post-frontal environment
with a low probability (10%)/high impact threat for thunderstorms
Monday. The necessary ingredients of lift (cold front with upper-
level support, vorticity maximum, 125 knot jet streak at 300
millibars), instability (warm, moist air below cold, dry air), and
moisture (precipitable water value of 0.70 inches) are there, but
whether or not they align in time and space is the holdup. As the
threat seems more prevalent Monday than Tuesday now, the limiting
factor is even moreso instability, let me explain. If clouds
linger, the atmosphere will remain more stable. If clouds clear
and daytime heating is realized, the atmosphere will become more
unstable. I would say hills and mountains have the best chance,
but even then it may just come to fruition in the form of
cumulus. If a thunderstorm were to develop, the threats include
lightning, small hail, and locally heavy rainfall and gusty winds.
The unsettled weather will result in the Oakland Museum (OAMC1)
forecast to approach its daily minimum temperature records of 47
degrees set in 1974 on Tuesday and Wednesday mornings, the
official forecast is 50 degrees.

.LONG TERM...
(Wednesday through Saturday) Issued at 226 AM PDT Sun May 11 2025

Heights will be slow to rebuild Wednesday as the upper-level low
exits to the east. There is quite a bit of uncertainty Thursday and
beyond. Taking a look at global ensemble clusters, 68% suggest
heights will continue to build Thursday, while 32% suggest that
heights will stay the same or start falling again. This uncertainty
will obviously propagate through subsequent days. The most probable
outcomes of zonal flow, split flow, or shortwave troughing would
suggest temperatures near to slightly below seasonal normals with
nothing impactful on the horizon.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 514 AM PDT Sun May 11 2025

VFR conditions continue with the exception of HAF which is seeing
some reduced visibilities from mist. Winds stay light to moderate
through the morning with some CIGs forming along the coast and
around the bays. Moderate to breezy winds build in the afternoon as
widespread VFR re-establishes. Winds across the region reduce into
the night, but several sites keep moderate winds. A cold front nears
the region into the late night, bringing MVFR CIGs and spotty
showers. Rain chances increase and spread south into early Monday.

Vicinity of SFO...A short period of MVFR CIGs affect the SF Bay in
the mid morning wind continued moderate winds. These CIGs erode in
the late morning and winds build to 18 kts with 27 kt gusts. These
gusts cut off into the night, but prevailing winds stay moderate.
MVFR CIGs and spotty shower showers arrive into the night. More
consistent showers and slightly higher MVFR CIGs are expected later
into the night and last beyond the end of the TAF period.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...Moments of MVFR CIGs look to affect MRY in
the mid to late morning before clearing. Light to moderate winds
around the Monterey Bay increase into the afternoon with breezier
conditions expected at SNS. These winds reduce in the evening, but
stay moderate into the night. MVFR CIGs arrive into the late night
as the front nears.

.MARINE...
(Today through Friday)
Issued at 851 AM PDT Sun May 11 2025

Breezy and gusty winds continue with near gale force gusts today
for the southern most waters. Winds begin to reduce into the
afternoon but hazardous winds for smaller craft linger into
Monday. Light rain will be possible on Monday as a front moves
across the region with diminishing winds in the wake of the
frontal passage. Winds increase once again toward the middle of
the upcoming week. Moderate seas continue through the end of the
forecast period.
