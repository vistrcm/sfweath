...New AVIATION...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 321 AM PDT Tue Aug 8 2023

Cooler temperatures expected through the end of the work week.
Mid- level moisture associated with the remnants of former
Tropical Cyclone Eugene will approach the region by midweek. Small
rain chances are possible for the Central Coast but confidence is
currently low. High pressure and warmer temperatures return over
the weekend into early next week.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 321 AM PDT Tue Aug 8 2023

An upper level trough currently overhead has set the stage for a
more pronounced marine layer overnight. To further support the
marine layer the SFO-ACV gradient is pretty much nonexistent
while the SFO- SAC gradient has ramped up to nearly 2.5 mb.
Overnight satellite fog product confirms the stratus coverage
with widespread clouds along the coast and locally into the
inland valleys, especially the North Bay and Salinas Valleys. The
deeper marine layer and stronger onshore flow has also led to
cooler temperatures overnight with temperatures running 3 to 8
degrees colder than last night. It should be noted some patchy
dense fog will be possible along the immediate coast this morning
impacting Highway 1.

The much talked about drop in temperatures still looks valid for
today. Given the marine layer, lingering onshore flow, and trough
overhead high temperatures will be 5 to 15 degrees colder than
Monday. High temperatures will be in the upper 50s to upper 60s
coast/bays and 70s to upper 80s inland. Pretty wild to see a place
like Napa with a forecast high of 69 degrees for early August.
That forecast is degrees below normal for this time of year.

Not much change expected for tonight...marine layer the coast will
move inland again. 500 mb heights are forecast to lower even more
leading to a deepening of the marine layer. Have added drizzle to
the forecast along the coast and Santa Cruz mts.

.LONG TERM...
(Wednesday through Monday)
Issued at 344 AM PDT Tue Aug 8 2023

Most notable weather story during the long term remains the upper
level moisture associated with former TC Eugene. As it stands now
tropical moisture currently west of Baja will track northward and
eventually over Central CA Wednesday into Thursday. While most
model agrees with this thinking the details vary, which could have
big difference in outcomes. A few of the CAMs bring the moisture
farther north into Monterey/San Benito counties, while more
coarse resolution models keep the moisture axis far south and
east. After collaborating with neighboring offices will lean more
toward CAMs, which brings the earliest upper level moisture into
Monterey/San Benito early Wednesday. This increase in upper level
moisture coincides with some weak upper level instability (MU
CAPE, lapse rates, modified total totals). Therefore, a low chance
(15%) for thunderstorms will be possible for southern areas of
Monterey/San Benito Wednesday into Thursday. The moisture profile
looks dry initially, but quickly switches to wet as high PWAT air
(over one inch) tracks northward. The transition from isolated dry
thunderstorms quickly to wet will help lower fire weather
concerns. In addition to thunderstorm chances, ample low level
moisture exists resulting in higher likelihood for drizzle early
Wednesday/Thursday. While locations north of Monterey Bay don`t
have a mention of thunder they will still likely see an increase
in some mid-high level clouds. One of CAMs does keep moisture
lingering into Friday with some QPF, but confidence is too low at
this point to extend precip chances.

Over the weekend and into early next week 500 mb heights rebound
with warming 850 mb temperatures. This transition will result in a
warming trend, especially well inland with highs reaching the
triple digits once again.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 453 AM PDT Tue Aug 8 2023

Marine layer has continued to deepen overnight, currently sitting
at around 1600 feet near Bodega Bay, and almost 2000 feet at Fort
Ord. IFR CIGs currently across much of the region are expected to
begin to lift and mix out towards the late morning bringing VFR
conditions for most terminals. VFR lasts into the early evening
before stratus returns, reducing CIGs to MVFR conditions. Current
light winds expected to strengthen into the afternoon to become
breezy to moderate around 10-15 knots, and gusty around the SF
Bay.


Vicinity of SFO...Currently VFR, though expecting MVFR CIGs to
develop briefly towards 13Z, then return to VFR towards 17Z. At
this time confidence in this is low to moderate, with highest
chances of MVFR CIGs developing around 56%. This will be something
to keep an eye on into the morning, as updates may be needed. That
aside, expecting VFR to prevail come 17-18Z for KOAK and KSFO, and
lasting through the early evening. W/NW winds increasing to
around 13-15 knots into the late afternoon, gusting near 20
knots.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...LIFR CIGs and low visibilities continue
through the late morning lifting to become MVFR towards the late
morning hours. Not expecting KMRY to clear to VFR, instead,
clearing to MVFR in the mid afternoon before IFR CIGs return in
the early evening. Highest confidence for clearing is at KSNS in
the early afternoon with stratus returning and IFR CIGS resuming
in the early evening. Winds onshore and increasing to become
breezy around 10-11 knots in the afternoon.

.MARINE...
(Today through Sunday)
Issued at 321 AM PDT Tue Aug 8 2023

Northwesterly winds persist through at least midweek, with breezy
to gusty conditions expected over the northern waters. Fresh and
breezy winds slowly diminish across the southern waters through
the day Tuesday to become moderate to gentle as surface high
pressure shifts farther offshore. Moderate period (12-16 seconds)
southerly swell continues through much of the week and will
gradually increase into late week, in addition to short period
wind waves and light northerly swell. A few showers are possible
mid to late week.

.MTR WATCHES/WARNINGS/ADVISORIES...
