...New UPDATE, MARINE...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 108 AM PDT Thu Aug 22 2024

A dynamic upper level system will bring cooler temperatures today
through Saturday. A slight chance of light rain continues across the
North and East Bay Friday night into Saturday, though the forecast
trend is drier. Temperatures will quickly rebound Sunday through
Tuesday as the system exits north and east, and high pressure builds
to our west over the open Pacific.

&&

.UPDATE...
Issued at 902 AM PDT Thu Aug 22 2024

Low clouds and patchy coastal drizzle are impacting much of the
region this morning with conditions slow to clear this afternoon.
This is as a frontal boundary remains just to our north and an
anonymously cool air mass remains aloft. As such, temperatures
across the interior will warm into the upper 70`s to lower 80`s
(warmest interior spots) with upper 50`s to near 70 degrees closer
to the coast. Thus, no updates anticipate to the ongoing forecast.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 108 AM PDT Thu Aug 22 2024

A dynamic upper level low will continue dropping south out of the
Gulf of Alaska today, gradually shifting farther ESE into Oregon and
northern California later tonight into tomorrow. Cooler temperatures
aloft along with a surface trough in vicinity of the North Bay today
will combine to drop temperatures into the 70s and 80s inland, with
upper 50s and 60s along the coast. The deepening marine layer this
morning will help produce increased coverage of low stratus than
we`ve been seeing the past few days, with some coastal areas only
seeing partial clearing this afternoon. It will be mostly sunny
inland, with cloud cover gradually increasing area wide later
tonight into Friday. Temperatures tomorrow will drop another few
degrees, struggling to eclipse 80 even in our typically warmer spots
inland. Overall, highs tomorrow will be 10-15 degrees below
normal.

.LONG TERM...
(Friday through Wednesday)
Issued at 108 AM PDT Thu Aug 22 2024

Rain chances Friday night into Saturday continues to trend drier
unfortunately, with slight chance PoPs across the North and East
Bay, with better chances farther north out of our area. Locations
fortunate enough to see some rain can expect to see less than a
tenth of an inch, but certainly welcomed especially this time of
year. The backside of the upper low will produce a sharp, deepening
trough across northern California late Friday into early Saturday,
with the aforementioned rain chances accompanying a bonafide cold
front that pushes south across our area late Friday night into
early Saturday morning. Adjusted NBM temperatures on Saturday down
a notch given the proximity of the upper trough axis and
increased cloud coverage across the region. There is little to no
thermal instability associated with the passage of the upper low,
so thunderstorms in our area are not anticipated attm.

H50 height and thickness increases rebound quickly behind the
exiting system on Sunday. Temperatures on Sunday will jump 5-10
degrees from Saturday, right around or slightly below seasonal
averages. The building ridge to our west over the open Pacific will
lift temperatures another 5-10 degrees inland on Monday with our
normally warmer inland areas climbing back up around or slightly
above the century mark. The inland heat peaks Tuesday as another
potent closed low moves inland over western Canada, flattening the
ridge over our area.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 426 AM PDT Thu Aug 22 2024

Stratus is developing across the SF Bay Area and the Monterey Bay
region, expected to continue to develop across the terminals of the
SF Bay Area and Central Coast. Confidence in stratus impacts is
increasing in the North Bay, where stratus could be patchier with
temporary ceilings. Have added a TEMPO at STS as stratus has formed
in the southern end of the Sonoma County valleys. Onshore flow
continues through the TAF period with breezy and gusty winds
developing this afternoon and evening. Light rain chances begin
after the end of the TAF period, but timing continues to be
uncertain.

Vicinity of SFO... MVFR/IFR conditions continue through around 17-
18Z, with ceilings expected right at or slightly under the MVFR/IFR
threshold. Breezy onshore flow continues with gusts up to 25-30
knots this afternoon and evening. Low to moderate confidence of MVFR
ceilings this evening into Friday morning, with a greater confidence
at OAK. Very low probability of gusts above 35 knots during the
forecast period.

SFO Bridge Approach... Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals... MVFR stratus through mid to late morning
with some potential for stratus to linger around MRY through the
afternoon. Onshore flow continues through the period with moderately
breezy winds this afternoon and evening. Stratus returning to the
terminals during the early evening hours.

&&

.MARINE...
(Today through Tuesday)
Issued at 902 AM PDT Thu Aug 22 2024

Northwest breezes persist into the early weekend as an upper
level trough moves inland. Rain chances increase over the coastal
waters early Friday into Saturday. By mid to late Saturday, winds
ease and become light to moderate and dry weather returns.
Significant wave heights and winds look to build by the middle of
the next work week.

&&

.MTR WATCHES/WARNINGS/ADVISORIES...
CA...None.
PZ...Small Craft Advisory until 9 PM PDT this evening for Mry Bay-SF
     Bay N of Bay Bridge.
