.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 302 AM PST Sun Feb 4 2024

The strong storm system takes aim on the region through early Monday
with another round of heavy rain and gusty, potentially damaging
winds possible. Keep up with the latest forecast changes.

&&

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 302 AM PST Sun Feb 4 2024

The storm is arriving.

Key Messages as the weather changes into the night:
* Strong, potentially damaging wind and rain
* Flooding of roads, streams, and poorly draining areas
* Flood Watch remains in effect
* Flash Flood Watch for River Burn Area
* Downed trees possible due to strong, gusty winds
* Greatest wind damage concern along coast and in high elevations
* Wind Advisories and High Wind Warnings in effect
* Very hazardous sea state with Storm to hurricane force winds

Smaller streams are already seeing rises ahead of the main rain
band. Winds are increasing along the Big Sur Coast and higher peaks
across the Santa Cruz mtns and the Diablo range, gusting around 60
mph.

Expect winds to ramp up in the next few hours, with locations along
the Big Sur coast seeing around 80 mph gusts with 90 mph possible.
The southern marine zones along the Big Sur Coast to 60 nautical
miles out will peak around 80 kt gusts (roughly 90 mph) which put
them in Hurricane Force Wind warning criteria. Winds around the rest
of the Bay Area and Central Coast increase in the mid morning as the
heavier rain arrives.  Gusts as high as 80 mph are expected in the
peaks and ridges. Some gusts of 70 mph could mix down to the
surface, especially along coastal areas through the afternoon.

Moderate to heavy rain along with the dangerous winds will make for
a hazardous day. Localized urban flooding, reduced visibility from
blowing rain, and downed trees along with wind debris are expected
as the rain band arrives. Shallow mud slides will be possible as the
near surface soil is already saturated, with debris flow and slides
being a concern within the River Fire Burn Scar in Monterey Co.

The overnight forecast package added some of the final adjustments,
with the focus remaining on the winds, hence the upgrade in the
marine wind hazards. For the most part, the forecast remains on
track from previous updates.

Here are the updated rainfall totals through Monday afternoon:

2.00" to 3.00": Santa Clara Valley, Interior East Bay: there is the
potential for lesser rainfall in the rain shadowed valleys

2.50" to 3.50": San Francisco, Oakland, East Bay Hills, lower
elevations of San Mateo Co, interior North Bay, interior Monterey Co
and San Benito Co

3.50" to 5.00": Santa Cruz Co and higher elevations of the North Bay

5.00" to 7.00": The highest peaks of the Santa Cruz Mtns, the Santa
Lucias and Big Sur Coast

Greater than 7.00": The highest peaks of the Big Sur Coast

.LONG TERM...
(Monday night through next Friday)
Issued at 207 PM PST Sat Feb 3 2024

Post frontal rain showers will continue into early Tuesday before
tapering off from north to south.  Afternoon temperatures through
the remainder of the week struggle to warm out of the mid/upper 50s
(40s for the higher peaks). Overnight lows will range from the upper
30s to mid 40s. Rain potentially returns by Wednesday night/early
Thursday morning with no significant impacts expected at this
time.
