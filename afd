...New AVIATION...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 1210 AM PDT Sat Jul 29 2023

Mild weather continues with seasonal temperatures. Expect the
typical ebb and flow of coastal clouds each night/morning giving
way to sunny afternoon conditions across the interior. Breezy
onshore winds will occur each afternoon.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 141 AM PDT Sun Jul 30 2023

The Bay Area and Central Coast remain between low pressure over the
northeast Pacific and a sprawling high pressure ridge over the
interior Southwest. This was providing southwest flow aloft and
westerly (onshore) surface winds. The marine layer depth hasn`t
changed appreciably over the past few days and remains in the 1,000
to 1,500 ft range per area profilers. Low stratus development is
similar to a little more widespread when compared to yesterday at
this time. Clouds were prevalent around San Francisco Bay, along
the Sonoma and San Mateo coastline, and around Monterey Bay at
this hour, with generally clear skies elsewhere. The onshore winds
and modest marine layer should keep lower elevations moist with
decent overnight humidity recoveries. However the high elevations
and interior will remain dry with minimum relative humidity values
dropping to around 10-25 percent this afternoon. Yesterday`s
Flynn Fire near Altamont Pass is a reminder that fine fuels are
drying and that fire starts can happen more easily. Given these
conditions opted to advertise lower minimum relative humidity
values today as compared to the National Blend of Models in favor
of a blend between yesterday`s observed values and those forecast
by our local WRF model. Otherwise no real changes in the
temperature department with interior areas climbing into the 80s
and 90s with 60s and 70s along the coast and bays. Lows tonight
will dip into the 50s, with 60s to lower 70s in the hills.

.LONG TERM...
(Monday through Saturday)
Issued at 141 AM PDT Sun Jul 30 2023

Look for a slight cooling trend into mid week as the Pacific trough
promotes steady onshore flow and a modest marine layer. A warming
trend develops thereafter as the upper ridge flexes back towards our
area. A weak upper perturbation passes through the region late
Tuesday into Wednesday with increasing high level moisture
suggesting some cloud cover is possible. For now elevated
instability doesn`t appear to coincide with the best moisture over
our area, but this is worth keeping an eye on going forward.
Otherwise we will remain along the ridge periphery through late week
with a compressing marine layer and onshore winds. The temperature
forecast becomes murkier into next week as the upper high
retrogrades towards northern Baja and SoCal. However variability in
upper heights over central CA is high, so the exact degree of
warming remains in question for us. Stay tuned.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 449 AM PDT Sun Jul 30 2023

Current satellite imagery shows stratus advecting in over the SF
Bay area, Monterey Peninsula, and down the Salinas valley,
bringing low IFR-LIFR CIGs across the region this morning. Stratus
is expected to clear towards the mid morning for most terminals,
with the caveat of slightly later for KMRY. Otherwise, expecting
VFR conditions to prevail through the day today with breezy
(10-12 knots) northwesterly winds, with locally gusty conditions
at terminals near coastal gaps. Stratus looks to return in the
late night tonight into the early morning hours of Monday.


Vicinity of SFO...After a night of IFR CIGs for both KSFO and KOAK,
conditions are currently VFR for KSFO, with scattered to few low
clouds around the KSFO terminal. At this time, confidence is low
in IFR CIGs redeveloping at KSFO this morning, though scattered
to few low clouds may persist. KOAK continues to see IFR CIGs as
stratus pushes inland through the golden gate gap. That being
said, generally expecting clearing by the midmorning, towards 17Z.
West-northwest winds gusting up to 25 knots develop into the
afternoon and evening.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...LIFR conditions expected to persist
through the late morning for KMRY. Expecting clearing to VFR
towards 19Z as stratus mixes out, clearing sooner for KSNS. Breezy
winds out of the northwest develop into the afternoon, around 8-12
knots, then diminishing into the late night. Stratus returns
towards the late night tonight, bringing IFR-LIFR conditions once
again.

&&

.MARINE...
(Tonight through next Thursday)
Issued at 900 PM PDT Sat Jul 29 2023

Northwest winds persist across the coastal waters with moderately
strong and gusty conditions expected through the remainder of the
weekend and into next week. Gale force gusts likely south of
Point Sur. The San Francisco Bay, Delta, and Monterey Bay regions
will see gusty conditions develop each afternoon and evening,
then diminishing to become light to moderate overnight. In
addition to short period wind waves, a small southerly swell will
continue to move through the waters through the forecast period.
