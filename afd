.KEY MESSAGES...
Updated at 620 AM PDT Wed Sep 10 2025

 - 15-25% slight chance of isolated to scattered thunderstorms
   Wednesday afternoon.

 - Marginal risk for flash flooding in northern Napa and Sonoma
   counties.

 - Drier and slightly warmer weather Friday and Saturday.

 - Unsettled weather may return to the Bay Area on Sunday.

.UPDATE...
Issued at 939 AM PDT Wed Sep 10 2025

Radar returns are showing scattered showers in southern San Mateo
County, western Santa Cruz County, and across the offshore areas
as far south as the Monterey Peninsula. The main forecast issue
continues to be the chances for convection in the North Bay this
afternoon and evening. The 12 Z (5 AM) sounding from Oakland
reported 174 J/kg of surface-based CAPE values, with values of 500
J/kg or above expected in the North Bay this afternoon,
corresponding to an elevated risk of convection in the region. No
changes to the forecast at this time.

.SHORT TERM...
Issued at 125 AM PDT Wed Sep 10 2025
(Today and Thursday)

Today`s the day! The upper-level low that brought us rain the past
two days will be overhead providing the best chance for
thunderstorms with this system and the essential ingredients of
lift, instability, and moisture in place. While the isolated to
scattered thunderstorm threat is namely for northern Napa and Sonoma
Counties, I cannot completely rule out the rest of the area although
the ingredients become far less favorable southward. The September
10th 00Z sounding revealed a low-level temperature inversion/cap
near 800 millibars - over 100 millibars below the freezing level.
Thus, surface temperatures would have to be high enough to break
that cap and/or terrain would have to do the heavy lifting
(literally) to get a thunderstorm. This is important because no ice
= no thunderstorm. The long, skinny CAPE profile on model point
soundings suggests that it is highly dependent on the surface dew
point temperature and surface temperature. MUCAPE will be surface
based CAPE in this case; thus, thunderstorm activity will kickoff by
the afternoon and diminish after sunset once daytime heating is
lost. Flooding and lightning threats exist with all thunderstorms;
remember: when thunder roars, go indoors! and see a flash, dash
inside!  Outside of potential thunderstorm development, rain showers
will be possible this afternoon and to a lesser extent tomorrow
afternoon - accumulation will be beneficial.

.LONG TERM...
Issued at 125 AM PDT Wed Sep 10 2025
(Friday through Tuesday)

Global ensemble clusters remain in agreement with the upper-level
low exiting to the northeast on Friday and split flow developing
across the area Saturday. A developing gale force low in the Gulf of
Alaska will bring the next round of unsettled weather to the area on
Sunday via cold front. The uncertainty right now lies in how deep
that upper-level low will dig and what adverse impacts if any are
brought to the region. This uncertainty gets propagated into Monday
and Tuesday with global ensemble clusters split nearly 50/50 on if
the trough will continue to dig or if ridging builds in from the
Eastern Pacific Ocean.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 523 AM PDT Wed Sep 10 2025

Moderate confidence that MVFR CIGs will continue through the
remainder of the morning but, given the upper level low progressing
into the West Coast, fluctuations higher and lower may temporarily
occur as well. Shower activity looks to pick up late morning into
the afternoon with some potential for thunderstorms in the
northernmost portions of Sonoma and Napa Counties. Current thinking
is that thunderstorms will not impact any of the TAF sites and will
be more terrain driven/confined to the north of STS and APC. That
being said, if a thunderstorm were to impact any of the sites it
would be STS with the highest potential for storms this afternoon.
If a thunderstorm or stronger cell does impact an airport, gusts
greater than in the TAF may develop and visibilities may temporarily
reduce. General thinking is that CIGs will at least briefly rise
above 3000 ft this afternoon before dropping back to MVFR conditions
late this evening.

Vicinity of SFO...CIGs will be right on the VFR-MVFR border with
fluctuations expected through the remainder of the morning given the
upper level low pushing into the West Coast. MVFR CIGs are likely to
return later tonight and then persist through the end of the TAF
period. Winds stay onshore through the TAF period with winds are 10-
12 knots this afternoon. While thunderstorms are not anticipated to
impact SFO, if a stronger shower moves over the airport locally
stronger gusts and temporarily reduced visibility may develop.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...Highest confidence in MVFR CIGs for the
majority of the TAF period. Expecting CIGs to briefly rise, becoming
VFR, during the afternoon before MVFR CIGs return late
afternoon/early evening. Adjusted the timing of MVFR CIGs returning
earlier but this may need to be adjusted depending on what scattered
showers do this afternoon. Low confidence that showers will impact
MRY and SNS, but if they do develop it would most likely be this
afternoon into tonight. If a shower moves directly over the airport,
it may result in locally stronger gusts and temporary reductions in
visibility.

.MARINE...
(Today through Monday)
Issued at 939 AM PDT Wed Sep 10 2025

Moderate NW winds and moderate seas continue through Thursday with
localized fresh gusts across the northern outer waters. Winds
increase Friday through the weekend with fresh NW winds spreading
across the majority of the coastal waters. Wind waves will build
Friday into the weekend as winds increase and a moderate period NW
swell train will arrive Friday into Saturday, resulting in
moderate  to moderate rough seas. Isolated to scattered showers
continue  Wednesday and Thursday.
