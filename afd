...New UPDATE, MARINE...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 327 AM PDT Mon Oct 28 2024

Scattered post frontal showers remain expected today with light
accumulations up to a few hundredths of an inch possible.
Below normal temperatures continue into next weekend.

.UPDATE...
Issued at 903 AM PDT Mon Oct 28 2024

Unfortunately our radar went down this morning and the technicians
are on their way to investigate this issue. In the meantime, we
have requested a GOES-18 mesosector to view 1 min satellite
images. The combination of these images and the Sacramento radar
show that a light shower is approaching San Francisco and should
arrive between 1030 and 1100. The atmosphere will become more
unstable this afternoon, especially with the clear skies allowing
the surface temperature to climb well above the air aloft. The
latest aircraft soundings show the CAPE is currently around 150
J/kg, and the HRRR predicts this will reach 400-500 this
afternoon. The convective temperature is only 64 degrees from the
morning sounding, which shouldn`t be a problem. The inhibitors are
an elevated inversion around 700 mb or roughly -10C, and a PWAT
around 0.64. Overall, the low-level lapse rates are producing good
instability, but the moisture and elevated inversion will limit
any stronger convection. This convection will mostly be below the
freezing level, and thunderstorms chances remain very low.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 327 AM PDT Mon Oct 28 2024

Post frontal scattered rain showers remain possible today, but,
accumulation totals have continued to trend downwards with any sites
that do experience rain to receive only a few hundredths of an inch.
The highest probability of precipitation (40-45%) continues to be in
the North Bay while across the rest of the Bay Area the likelihood
of precipitation drops to 35-40%. Shower chances continue to
decrease heading farther south to the Central Coast where there is
only a 20-30% chance for precipitation. Thunderstorm chances for the
North Bay have decreased to less than 5% as the overall shower
chances have trended lower.

Widespread much cooler high temperatures expected today after the
passage of yesterday`s cold front. Sites across the interior will
generally be in the 60s while sites along the coast will be mainly
in the upper 50s to low 60s. Morning low temperatures are expected
to cool as well with low temperatures dropping 4 to 6 degrees
between Monday morning and Tuesday morning. For most sites this
means the low temperature will drop from the low to mid 50s to low
to mid 40s. Temperatures will cool more significantly for those
located in valleys or up in elevated terrain where lows will drop
from the low to mid 40s to the mid to upper 30s. Gusty winds remain
possible during the day today through early Tuesday morning with
gusts up to 35 mph possible. Gusts may be higher within mountain
gaps and passes, along mountain ridgetops, and within the Salinas
Valley where there is a higher likelihood (70-80% chance) of 35 to
40 mph gusts beginning Monday afternoon through early Tuesday
morning.

.LONG TERM...
(Tuesday through Sunday)
Issued at 327 AM PDT Mon Oct 28 2024

The two main things to take note of this week are 1) below normal
temperatures continue through next weekend and 2) the storm door
remains open with two additional systems to arrive this week.
Overall, not a lot of fluctuations in high temperatures this week
with most sites observing temperatures 5 to 15 degrees below normal.
This results in highs lingering in the 60s across the interior and
upper 50s to low 60s along the coast. Looking at our overnight lows
we do see a bit more fluctuation in them with temperatures dropping
into the upper 30s to low 40s Tuesday and Wednesday before climbing
back into the 40s on Thursday. Interior Monterey and San Benito
counties continues to be the exception to this where temperatures
will fall into the low to mid 30s early this week with lows in the
mid to upper 30s to persist through late week. Accordingly, as
overnight temperatures cool into the 30s, the potential for frost
increases with guidance showing a 20 to 45% chance for frost across
southern interior Monterey County Tuesday and Wednesday.

Tuesday will be the driest day this week as a shortwave ridge moves
through the West Coast. This will be short lived, however, as a
reinforcing trough moves into the Pacific Northwest and brings with
it elevated chances for light precipitation again Wednesday into
Thursday. Totals have trended upwards over the most recent forecast
update, but, generally remain around 0.1" or less everywhere outside
of the North Bay where favored areas may see 0.25"+ of rain. While
we can still expect some fluctuations as to the exact amount of
precipitation we receive, high resolution models are suggesting a
more stratiform (i.e. steady) precipitation set up is more likely
which could result in higher totals across the North Bay. By
Thursday evening, conditions should be drier but lingering drizzle
along the coast and in the North Bay may provide an additional spook
for those engaging in Halloween activities. Friday into Saturday, we
see upper level troughing strengthen over the PNW and dip further
south, extending over Central California. This system will bring
with it more widespread chances for wetting rain with widespread
totals between 0.1" to 0.25" inches possible. The European model
does suggest that there is some potential for this system to develop
into a cut off low as it moves through southern California into
Arizona. However not all models agree with this as while the GFS
does show the low strengthening and moving south into southern
California and Arizona, it does not show the low becoming cut off.
Regardless, below average temperatures and a more moist airmass will
help to reduce fire weather concerns heading into next weekend as
this system exits California. Late next weekend forecast uncertainty
increases but both ensemble and CPC guidance suggest a return to
warmer and drier conditions across the region during early
November.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 508 AM PDT Mon Oct 28 2024

Bay Area in post cold-frontal environment with cooling air aloft
and breezy NW winds at the sfc. Overnight cloud trends showed
mostly clear skies but persistent nw onshore flow and moist
boundary layer allowing some low clouds to pile up along the San
Mateo coast and across the South Bay hills. Upstream another weak
line of showers will weaken as it pushes through the North Bay and
into the Bay Area today. Higher confidence for clearing skies as
boundary layer dries out tonight into Tuesday morning.

Vicinity of SFO...Some low cigs over land in vicinity of San Bruno
gap will be drifting over the tower and runways at times this
morning. Skies should trend more Sct vs Bkn late morning through
the afternoon. Increasing NW winds from late morning through early
evening hours.

SFO Bridge Approach...Low clouds over the Peninsula may briefly
spread over the approach at times through 17z.

Monterey Bay Terminals...Lingering low clouds KSNS this morning
with higher confidence for VFR conditions at KMRY today into this
evening. Low clouds for KSNS should mix out by 17z.
