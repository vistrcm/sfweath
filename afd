...New UPDATE, MARINE...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 357 AM PST Thu Nov 14 2024

Scattered light rain chances persist today, with high surf and king
tides. Even colder temperatures begin to set in for tomorrow and
the weekend.

.UPDATE...
Issued at 841 AM PST Thu Nov 14 2024

Isolated to scattered showers are continuing to move through
Sonoma and Marin counties, with rainfall totals generally near a
few hundredths to a tenth of an inch. Latest high resolution model
guidance continues to support isolated thunderstorms across the
Bay Area, and the SPC continues to place the Bay Area from Santa
Cruz and Morgan Hill northward in a general risk for
thunderstorms. Thunderstorm activity should begin to diminish in
the late afternoon and evening hours.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 357 AM PST Thu Nov 14 2024

Scattered showers and light rain chances will continue today as a
sharpening upper trough cools the mid and upper levels, helping to
modestly increase low level CAPE (~200 J/kg at most) with steeper
lapse rates aloft. However, any thunderstorm activity should remain
isolated and short lived, with some wind gusts up to 30-40 MPH
possible with the strongest showers, likely to occur along the coast
from North Bay down to the Bay Area late this morning into the
afternoon. Moisture is shallow, so rainfall totals will struggle to
exceed a tenth of an inch at any one location, with many spots
only seeing a trace to a few hundredths. Temperatures today will
continue to run 5-10 degrees below normal. A cold front will begin
to push south through our area later tonight, dropping max
temperatures another 5 degrees or so for Friday after a chilly
start to the day, with our entire area in the 30s and 40s by
sunrise tomorrow.

.LONG TERM...
(Friday through Wednesday)
Issued at 357 AM PST Thu Nov 14 2024

Light rain chances will persist along and just behind the cold front
that advances south through our area by late morning/early afternoon
tomorrow. Cooler and drier air quickly fills in behind the front. As
the pressure gradient eases behind the front and progressive ridging
aloft sets in, surface winds will become light and variable under
mostly clear skies. As a result, radiational cooling this weekend
will drop temperatures at or below freezing for many interior
locations both Saturday and Sunday morning. A Freeze Watch will be
considered by the day shift today. Rain chances increase again
during the day Sunday, with the best chances along the coast as you
move north from the Bay Area into the North Bay. The troughing late
this weekend has trended a little farther north and drier for our
area over last couple of model runs, while temperatures remain cool
into the beginning of next week. Signals for strong amplified
ridging along the West Coast for the middle of next week seem
reasonable, resulting in a nice warming trend through the remainder
of the extended forecast.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 445 AM PST Thu Nov 14 2024

A cold mid to upper level trough arrives from the northwest later
today, tonight and Friday morning. Conditions VFR-MVFR except areas
of IFR in scattered showers (showers likely becoming moderate to
heavy nearest the north Central Coast tonight and Friday morning).

Vicinity of SFO...VFR, periodic wet weather with an incoming cold
mid to upper level trough later today, tonight and Friday.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...VFR-MVFR, periodic wet weather with an
incoming cold mid to upper level trough later today, tonight and
Friday. Caveat: the depth, breadth and trajectory of this trough
favors the development of moderate to heavy passing showers and
may include small hail; not indicated in the current 12z KMRY and
KSNS TAFs, however will amend if needed per satellite, radar,
spotter reports, surface observations, etc.

.MARINE...
(Today through Tuesday)
Issued at 841 AM PST Thu Nov 14 2024

Expect rough to very rough seas to continue through Saturday as
moderate to large northwest swell builds. Northwesterly breezes
increase to become strong by Friday with gale force gusts
possible. Winds diminish and seas abate into next week.

&&

.BEACHES...
Issued at 404 AM PST Thu Nov 14 2024

Moderate to large northwest swell today to Saturday. A High Surf
Advisory is in effect 7 AM today to 11 AM Saturday.

King tide season is here and will bring high tides up to 1-1.5 ft
above normal today - Monday. The late morning tide cycle will be
the one to watch, especially for exposed ocean beaches when high
surf combines with the king tide. Areas that typically flood during
king tides will very likely flood within a couple hours before to
a couple hours after the daily highest tides.
