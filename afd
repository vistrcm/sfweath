.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 400 AM PDT Wed Aug 16 2023

Warm temperatures and a Moderate HeatRisk will exist for inland
areas today. Cooling is expected for late week into the weekend.
Shower chances return for early next week as deep moisture spreads
into the region.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 400 AM PDT Wed Aug 16 2023

Satellite currently is showing mostly high clouds and clear skies
across our region, as we expect no more showers for the rest of
the night. Therefore, our radar will remain in "clear" mode until
tomorrow early evening where there is a slight chance (15% or
less) for convection over the southern Diablo Range. The same
factors that allowed for showers near those San Benito County
hills yesterday, will be present for this evening with orographic
lifting influence and instability, along with some global models
showing mid-level moisture (40-60% humidity). Therefore, slight
chances for showers were added into the forecast.

With the persistent upper level influence, the weather today is
expected to be similar as yesterdays with a continuation of
temperatures trending on the warmer side. The maximum temperatures
are expected to reach the mid to upper 90s in the interior with the
usual hotter spots reaching up low to mid 100s. Coastal areas are
expected to see mid 70s to low 80s. Overnight, the minimum
temperatures will be mid to high 60s in the interior, as the coast
will see mid to high 50s. Expect possible patchy coastal fog
overnight into the early morning.

.LONG TERM...
(Thursday through Tuesday)
Issued at 400 AM PDT Wed Aug 16 2023

Thursday and Friday:

The upper level pattern will feature high pressure centered over the
Four Corners region with a closed circulation offshore from the Bay
Area. Invest 90E should become a Tropical Cyclone by this time with
the system moving WNW and roughly parallel to the southwest Mexico
coast. Dry air wrapping cyclonically around the upper low should
limit precipitation chances locally, but can`t rule out an isolated
shower or two. Temperatures should cool to near seasonal values
given the deepening trough.

This Weekend:

The aforementioned Tropical Cyclone will be drawn poleward around
the southwest periphery of an expansive upper ridge and will track
NW to WNW roughly parallel to Baja California. Rich tropical
moisture should advect into the Desert Southwest region, with lower
confidence in moisture reaching portions of our area late in the
period. The GFS and its ensembles are more bullish on moisture
advection, and increase precipitable water values to around 1.5
inches locally by Sunday morning. In contrast, the ECMWF and its
ensembles suggest a slightly stronger ridge and keep the mid levels
much drier through this period. The National Blend of Models is dry
during this time and given uncertainty see no reason to quibble for
the moment. Low-end shower chances could evolve with future updates
if the earlier moisture return comes to fruition. No real surprises
anticipated in the temperature department with seasonal readings
expected.

Early Next Week:

The persistent low pressure area offshore will impart a southerly
steering flow on the Tropical Cyclone and accelerate its poleward
movement. The system should gradually decay while approaching SoCal
with the surface low either weakening or dissipating given greater
stability and cooling sea surface temperatures. However anomalous and
deep tropical moisture is likely to accompany its remnants as they
lift poleward along the California coast. The amount of moisture
suggested by the deterministic 22.00Z GFS run is impressive, with
precipitable water values reaching 2 inches or greater along the
Central Coast on Monday, and remaining above 1.5 inches around the
Bay Area into Tuesday. The corresponding Time-Height profile
suggests deep saturation throughout the atmospheric column for at
least a 6-12 hour window. The 22.00Z ECMWF is a bit slower, but is
remarkably similar in bringing deep moisture to the region. So our
confidence in local rain impacts is increasing. However, it`s simply
too early to get too specific on amounts. A few caveats to
consider are: 1) the tropical system has yet to form. Until this
occurs uncertainty in the track and intensity forecast is much
greater; 2) the ultimate track is paramount in how much
precipitation we`ll see. If it straddles the coast amounts will be
greater, however if it stays offshore amounts could be much less.
Confidence should increase over the next few days once models
have a better handle on the system`s evolution and specifics will
become clearer with time. For now, keep up with the forecast and
plan for the possibility of wet and unsettled conditions for early
next week.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 438 AM PDT Wed Aug 16 2023

Satellite shows some IFR/LIFR conditions starting to build over
the North Bay terminals along with Monterey Bay still socked in
with low clouds and low visibility, as some inland terminals skies
remain clear along with SF Bay shows few clouds currently over
the terminals. Therefore, currently VFR and IFR/LIFR conditions
across the region. KSJC may experience IFR ceilings this morning
as some models suggest near 14Z, but had low confidence to include
in TAFs. Otherwise, all terminals are expected to improve to VFR
around 16- 17Z. Stratus is expected to return tonight but moderate
confidence on ceiling height. Models seem to agree of IFR
ceilings for North Bay terminals, with a chance of LIFR near the
end of the TAF period. KOAK is expected to lower to MVFR but there
is a high chance VFR may prevail through the TAF period due to
persistence. Onshore winds are expected to become moderate to
breezy this afternoon with a return of light winds tonight.

Vicinity of SFO...VFR with FEW high clouds over the terminal.
Moderate confidence that VFR will prevail through the TAF period, as
models suggest IFR ceilings late tonight/early tomorrow morning. If
terminal experience stratus, expect clearing near 16Z. N/NW winds
are expected to become breezy and gusty up to 21 knots this
afternoon.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...High confidence that LIFR will remain over
the terminals until 16-17Z where conditions will improve to VFR, but
expect IFR conditions to return this evening followed by LIFR late
tonight. Onshore winds will become breezy through the Salinas Valley
creating breezy conditions near KSNS. KMRY will become moderate,
with a return of light/moderate winds tonight for both terminals.

.MARINE...
(Today through Monday)
Issued at 438 AM PDT Wed Aug 16 2023

Gentle to light northwesterly winds persist across the coastal
waters through the end of the work week, with moderate afternoon
and evening winds expected across the San Francisco Bay into the
Delta. Moderate period southerly swell continues through the week
with a shorter period northwesterly swell. New northwest swell
arrives mid to late week, followed by gustier winds for the
upcoming weekend.
