...New AVIATION...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 237 AM PST Fri Nov 17 2023

Showers and storm chances linger through the morning. Winds and
gusts increase in the late morning through the afternoon as the
pacific low nears the area and brings wave of rain inland. Storm
chances increase and spread inland behind the first wave of rain.
Showers and storm chances last through Saturday. Dry conditions
return Sunday.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 237 AM PST Fri Nov 17 2023

Showers and weak storm cells continue to move through the marine
zones with much more storm activity well off the coast. Showers with
a few storm chances are expected through the morning ahead to the
stronger chances this afternoon.

The main event is happening today as the low pressure that has been
affecting the area finally moves inland, giving the best rain
chances the CWA has seen all week. The overnight forecast package
has fine-tuned the arrival of the low, as well as the winds and
lingering storm chances as the main system exits. Winds and gusts
are expected to increase ahead of the stronger rain chances, hitting
their peak in the late morning and afternoon. Moderate waves of rain
arrive in the late afternoon and continue through the late night.
Additional moisture will build in from the south and be directed
into the Central Coast, resulting in the strongest rain chances and
increased rainfall along the Big Sur Coast. Chances for storms
increase behind the first wave of rain and continue through. Storm
cells will cause locally heavier rain, stronger winds, and could
produce lightning.

.LONG TERM...
(Saturday through Thursday)
Issued at 237 AM PST Fri Nov 17 2023

Shower and storm activity becomes less organized into Saturday but
the chances for storms move farther inland. Expect storm chances
reduce and exit to the east Saturday night. Showers become
lighter through Saturday evening and exit early Sunday.

The overnight forecast package calls for the following rainfall
amounts between now and through Sunday morning:

0.30" to 0.60": Santa Clara Valley, Interior East Bay, Northern
Salinas Valley, San Benito Co

0.61" to 1.00": San Francisco, San Mateo Coast, Oakland, East Bay
Hills, San Mateo Co, lower elevations of Santa Cruz Co, Southern
Salinas Valley,

1.01 to 1.50": Santa Cruz Mtns, North Bay counties

1.51" to 2.25": Higher elevations of the Big Sur Coast, as well as
the highest peaks of the North Bay and Santa Cruz Mtns

Sunday begins a dry trend with warming temperatures as a ridge
builds. While there is a potential for light rain next Friday, let`s
focus on today first.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 319 AM PST Fri Nov 17 2023

Generally VFR with high clouds, except where stratus has developed,
generally at the higher elevations but also impacting STS. Isolated
showers continue at the coast and offshore in the morning, but
widespread rain returns to the area this afternoon. Model guidance
suggests two main rain bands with a potential for MVFR ceilings,
with one coming through in the afternoon and evening, with a break
around 03Z before rain returns overnight into Saturday morning.
Lingering showers could impact the North Bay during the break,
especially at the higher elevations. Breezy southerly winds and a
low confidence for thunderstorms (20-30% probability) with the rain
bands. Beyond the TAF period, rain chances diminish through the day
on Saturday.

Vicinity of SFO... Generally VFR with light winds through the
morning, then light rain comes through in the afternoon with a break
in the evening, returning again in the overnight hours. MVFR
ceilings expected with the rain bands, and a low confidence (20-30%
probability) for thunderstorms at the terminal from this afternoon
through Saturday morning.

SFO Bridge Approach... Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals... VFR with light winds for the rest of
tonight, with on-and-off rain returning in the afternoon, pausing in
the evening before another band comes through overnight. Have kept
the forecast for gusts up to 30 knots at SNS, as high resolution
models are still catching up to the TAF forecast. The general
forecast reasoning remains the same from earlier: wind direction
aligning with the Salinas Valley and rain helping bring down
momentum from the upper atmosphere helps set up a strong drainage
flow. As stated previously, wind gusts could exceed the TAF
forecast.

&&

.MARINE...
(Today through Wednesday)
Issued at 237 AM PST Fri Nov 17 2023

Showers in the northern coastal waters will slowly dissipate
through the morning. Widespread rain showers and a chance of
thunderstorms will develop this afternoon, continuing through
Saturday morning. Fresh to locally strong southerly breezes
develop today into Saturday, with gale force gusts possible in the
southern waters. Low pressure will dissipate as it moves inland
Saturday and rain chances will diminish by Sunday. In addition,
southwesterly swell builds tonight into Saturday and a new
northwest swell train arrives Sunday.
