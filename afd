.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 131 AM PDT Fri Jun 6 2025

A slight warming trend continues through the early part of next
week. Temperatures rise slightly above seasonal averages inland
while coastal areas remain near or slightly below seasonal averages.
A cooling trend is likely by the middle of next week.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 131 AM PDT Fri Jun 6 2025

Satellite imagery shows stratus developing across the coastal
valleys and beginning to spread inland, with the clouds mixing out
after sunrise through the morning hours. Morning lows continue to
hover into the upper 40s to middle 50s across the lower elevations,
perhaps as warm as 60 in the highest peaks. A slight warming trend
is expected to continue today with an upper level ridge building
into the Pacific Northwest and southwestern Canada; high
temperatures today reach the upper 70s to the middle 80s in the
inland valleys, into the lower 90s for the warmest spots, around the
70s across the San Francisco Bayshore, and into the lower to middle
60s along the Pacific coast. Winds should be generally light and
diurnal, with some stronger gusts this afternoon and evening of
around 20-25 mph through the gaps and passes, along the San Pablo
and northern San Francisco Bayshores, and the northern Salinas
Valley. With the marine layer remaining deep (around 1500-2000
feet), marine layer stratus should return to most of the coastal
valleys tonight.

.LONG TERM...
(Saturday through Thursday)
Issued at 131 AM PDT Fri Jun 6 2025

The upper level ridge will build across the northwestern United
States and southwestern Canada through the early part of next week.
However, an embedded jet will contribute to the formation of a
cutoff low meandering off the California coast, helping to moderate
the influence of the upper level ridge and reinforce the marine
layer. Thus, high temperatures will continue to ride near or
slightly above seasonal averages away from the immediate coastal
region, where the sea breeze will keep temperatures slightly below
seasonal averages. The warmest temperatures are expected early next
week with highs in the inland valleys reaching the middle to upper
80s, up to the upper 90s in the warmest spots of southern Monterey
County. By the middle of next week, a cooling trend should begin as
the upper level ridge erodes and an troughing pattern develops over
the West Coast.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 424 AM PDT Fri Jun 6 2025

The marine layer is holding steady at 2,000 feet as shown in the
Bodega Bay and Ft. Ord Profilers. This is bringing MVFR ceilings to
most terminals this morning, with IFR conditions in the North Bay.
The pattern is pretty straightforward and similar to the last few
days with clearing in the late morning and a return of stratus in
the evening. The guidance is a little uncertain on the return
timing, and the TAFs lean towards persistence as the pattern remains
fairly stable. Winds will remain moderate today with an onshore
breeze in the afternoon.

Vicinity of SFO...The donut hole in the stratus that we`ve seen the
last few nights closed a little earlier this morning. SFO will be
dealing with MVFR ceilings through sometime between 16 and 19Z based
on the guidance. The TAF is on the optimistic side (17Z) of the
guidance envelope based mainly on the clearing time yesterday
(1639Z). Moderate onshore winds this afternoon will ease overnight
as the stratus returns.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...Ceilings have just dropped into the IFR
category at MRY and will hover between high IFR and low MVFR at both
MRY and SNS through the morning. The stratus will erode sometime
around 18 to 20Z before returning overnight. Similar to this
morning, there is about a 50% chance that the ceilings drop below
the IFR threshold early Friday.

.MARINE...
(Today through Wednesday)
Issued at 424 AM PDT Fri Jun 6 2025

The pressure gradient has relaxed and buoys are now reporting a
gentle to moderate breeze across the coastal waters. Diurnal
effects will bring a fresh to strong SW breeze to the San
Francisco Bay over the next couple afternoons. Otherwise
conditions will be favorable through early next week when winds
start to build and a long period southwesterly swell arrives.
Winds and seas will rebuild more substantially mid to late next
week.
