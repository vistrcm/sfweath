...New AVIATION, MARINE...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 309 AM PDT Tue Jul 4 2023

A noticeable cooling trend begin today and with further cooling
expected the rest of the week. Temperatures will be below normal
for early July. The marine layer has returned with coastal
stratus inland overnight into the morning with clearer skies each
afternoon.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 320 AM PDT Tue Jul 4 2023

Happy 4th of July or Independence Day. Overnight satellite fog
product shows a well developed marine layer with ample stratus
covering the coastal waters and inland valleys. Little N-S
gradient (0.1mb) and moderate W-E gradient (3mb) has led to the
solid inland push of stratus. Travis AFB (KSUU) continues to gust
to 33kt overnight, which is indicative of the good onshore push
too. Re-established marine layer and onshore flow has also led to
cooler temperatures overnight with most place 3 to 5 degrees
colder, but a few inland spots are 10 to 15 degrees and some hill
locations are 25 degrees colder! Needless to say, but cloudy to
start the day for coast/bays and inland valleys. On the other
hand, far interior locations and higher terrain will start off
mostly clear. Morning clouds will be slow to dissipate/erode back
to the coast, but do expect inland sunshine today. Coastal
locations will hold onto lingering clouds through out the day.
Despite some sunshine temperatures today will be colder than
Monday. In fact, the latest model guidance used for the forecast
has trended colder over the last two runs. Highs will top out in
the 60s to lower 70s coast/bays and 70s to lower 90s inland.

Clouds will begin their inland march late this evening and early
tonight. Monterey Bay and Sonoma Valley will see clouds returning
6-8PM, but other locations will be delayed.

.LONG TERM...
(Wednesday through Monday)
Issued at 350 AM PDT Tue Jul 4 2023

High pressure that brought a few days of warmth will continue to
fade as an upper level trough become better defined over NorCal
for the rest of the week. No Sky July will be in full force with
night/morning clouds eroding to the coast each afternoon. The
temperature cooling trend noted today will continue through at
least Saturday with temperatures remaining 5 to 10 degree below
normal for early July. Highs will be in low 60s at the coast/bays
to low to mid 80s inland.

Toward the end of the forecast period of early next week weak
ridging develops over the region resulting in a more compressed
marine layer and warmer temperatures.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 511 AM PDT Tue Jul 4 2023

Nearly ideal conditions continue for marine layer stratus. The
marine layer depth is increasing, currently 2000 feet deep per
recent profiler data. The STS-UKI, SFO-SAC and SNS-SJC pressure
gradients are 1.3 mb, 2.7 mb and 1.5 mb respectively, resulting
in onshore and more locally south-north directed winds ushering
stratus inland. Ceilings are a mix of IFR and MVFR, and IFR
ceilings within a moderately deep marine layer strongly suggests
nearly ideal conditions for stratus, including patchy light
coastal drizzle may develop per recent meso-scale models and
global models. With a wall of stratus moving inland, mix out times
will be slow closest to the coast and bays, and may have all day
stratus at some of the coastal airports, including SFO Airport and
maybe OAK Airport as well. Otherwise VFR far inland, diurnal surface
warming and mixing inland will erode stratus that reaches far
inland during the day, with mixing back toward the coast during
the afternoon. Onshore winds and stratus /IFR-MVFR/ moving inland
tonight and Wednesday morning.

Vicinity of SFO...MVFR ceiling with tempo IFR ceiling forming due
to onshore winds coupled to lower level cool air advection. Light
drizzle may also develop thus also introduced in a tempo group 12z-14z
then IFR and light drizzle prevailing 14z-18z. Conditions gradually
lifting to MVFR by late morning or early afternoon. Stratus moving
back inland early to mid evening and stratus /MVFR/ prevailing tonight
and Wednesday morning.

SFO Bridge Approach...Stratus ceiling /MVFR/ in the approach through
much of the morning, gradually lifting to VFR by early afternoon.
Otherwise similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...The marine layer is 2000 feet deep per
profiler data at Fort Ord, yet IFR ceilings are mixed in with MVFR
ceilings. Patchy light drizzle may develop, conditions are nearly
ideal for stratus, low ceilings /IFR/ in a moderately deep marine
layer suggests this is the case. A gradually lifting of ceilings to
MVFR by late morning or early afternoon, could be all day stratus
along much of the Monterey Bay today. Otherwise stratus /MVFR/
moving back inland tonight, possibly lowering to IFR overnight
along with patchy light drizzle per recent model output.

.MARINE...
(Today through Sunday)
Issued at 446 AM PDT Tue Jul 4 2023

Surface high pressure over the eastern Pacific will result in a
continuation of moderate west to northwest winds through Thursday.
Gusty afternoon and evening onshore winds continuing for the SF
Bay to the Delta, mainly north of the Bay Bridge again today.
Northwest winds across the coastal waters steadily increasing
beginning Thursday and lasting through the weekend. Longer period
southerly swell 16-18 seconds and a shorter period northwesterly
swell continue through much of the week before a new southerly
swell train arrives Friday.

.MTR WATCHES/WARNINGS/ADVISORIES...
CA...Coastal Flood Advisory until 3 AM PDT Wednesday for CAZ506.

PZ...Small Craft Advisory from 3 PM this afternoon to 9 PM PDT this
     evening for PZZ530.

     Small Craft Advisory until 9 AM PDT this morning for PZZ570.
