...New SYNOPSIS, SHORT TERM, LONG TERM, AVIATION, MARINE...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 300 AM PDT Tue May 30 2023

Cooler temperatures in the short term as winds return to the
northwest. Breezier winds expected on Wednesday. A slight warming
trend is forecast for the end of the week that could potentially
return temperatures back to seasonal norms over the weekend.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 300 AM PDT Tue May 30 2023

The story in the short term is all about the 500 mb closed low that
is spinning just southwest of the Big Sur coast. This system has
brought cooler temperatures, southerly steering flow aloft and even
a sprinkle or two of precipitation over the last couple days. This
low must be a tourist because it has not stayed for long, but it
also is not moving very fast. Ensembles are still suggesting that it
will continue its track southward and make a turn eastward around
Point Conception and begin to held inland, passing over Los Angeles
late Tuesday evening.

Very few impacts from this low. There are limited returns on radar,
but the radar was switched back to clear air mode as none are
reaching the ground to our knowledge. There remains a robust cloud
layer, but the low has deepened it in such away that the impacts are
really above 3000 feet, so not much in the way for risk of fog.
Cooler air brought with it keeps the temperatures below normal for
this time of year. Last but not least, despite localized west-
northwest winds at the surface, prevailing winds aloft are from the
south owing to them wrapping around the center of the low counter
clockwise. As it moves southward, northwest winds will slowly
return, first to the North Bay Tuesday morning, and then to the
Central Coast by Tuesday evening. As the low drifts eastward inland,
the pressure gradient will tighten slightly for stronger wind gusts
over the waters and at higher elevations, but nothing near any type
of hazard product.

.LONG TERM...
(Wednesday through Monday)
Issued at 300 AM PDT Tue May 30 2023

Models have changed very little over the last 24 hours. Once the
current closed low moves inland early Wednesday morning, the longer
wave trough west of Vancouver will sink southward. It will be enough
to have fluctuations in the marine layer depth, maybe some coastal
drizzle, but not expecting any rain. Temperatures over the next two
to three days will fluctuate slightly but remain cool and below
normal for early June.

By late in the week, a weak upper level ridge is forecast to
develop. Ensemble models are not depicting any significant strength
from this ridge, though the main impacts will be for temperatures to
gradually trend warmer, and by next weekend high temperatures may
even reach the typical 70s around the Bay Area and 80s for interior
areas. High pressure will grow slightly, so whether or not lower
clouds and fog return, is yet to be determined.

Cluster analysis of the ensemble models is showing agreement that
this building ridge will be a part of a synoptic scale omega block
that can set up over the CONUS early next week. However, while many
of the clusters place the center over Saskatchewan and Manitoba,
there is one that moves it all the way westward to British Columbia
and the Pacific Northwest.  Though unlikely to move that far, but
this means is two things to look out for: 1.) little variability or
impactful weather at the end of the forecast period and 2.) the
strength and movement of any low that develops over the eastern
Pacific and the Desert Southwest and how that influences the marine
layer.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 300 AM PDT Tue May 30 2023

Very patchy cloud cover making for difficult forecasting. When
clouds do move over, they make for MVFR conditions. This 12Z package
focused on trying to hone in on timing for when any clouds move
over, which means adding a lot of TEMPO groups, but also lower
confidence. By 18Z, widespread VFR conditions are forecast. Winds
will be onshore and increase in the afternoon. Typically winds
ease at night, but the TAFs were edited to have a longer duration
of breezier winds given the tightening of the pressure gradient
expected. Clouds return for MVFR conditions once again Wednesday
morning.

Vicinity of SFO...VFR, but MVFR level clouds lurk nearby. TAFs
were amended with TEMPOs for the likelihood of when clouds may
move over, but confidence is low. As the sun rises, skies will
clear for VFR conditions, currently expected by 18Z. Winds will
increase with the seabreeze in the afternoon, likely lingering
longer into Tuesday night. There is high confidence in clouds
returning Tuesday night at MVFR level cigs, but confidence wanes
on the exact timing. A later return is possible if the pressure
gradient is weaker than current projections.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...MVFR. Breezy northwest winds Tuesday
afternoon. MVFR level cigs return Tuesday night. Low confidence on
the exact return time depending on how "together" the stratus clouds
remain through Tuesday or if they are more BKN and SCT over the
waters.

&&

.MARINE...
(Today through Sunday)
Issued at 233 AM PDT Tue May 30 2023

Southerly winds remain over the southern waters as winds over the
northern waters turn to northwest as the low pressure system sinks
southward. Expect widespread northwest winds Tuesday night into
Wednesday. These winds will then increase on Wednesday creating
steeper wind waves. Meanwhile, a mix of northwest and southerly
swells prevail through the week.
