.SHORT TERM...
Issued at 305 AM PDT Tue Oct 28 2025
(Today and tonight)

Any night owls out there? If so, you may notice quite the difference
walking outside tonight compared to last night. A 24 hour satellite
comparison shows widespread stratus across the Bay Area last night
compared to completely clear skies tonight. Relative humidity values
are running around 30% to 60% drier tonight compared to 24 hours
ago. This is in part thanks to zonal flow giving way to a building
ridge along the West Coast and persistent light offshore flow across
the region. Offshore flow typically brings in warmer and drier air
which will help to suppress fog and low level cloud development this
morning and keep morning temperatures warmer than they were
yesterday. This change in temperatures is most notable across the
higher elevations where temperatures are running around 10 to 14
degrees Fahrenheit warmer tonight than they were at this time
yesterday. Morning low temperatures will generally be in the upper
40s to low 50s with portions of the interior Central Coast reaching
the low to mid 40s. Temperatures warm up nicely by the afternoon
with highs in the mid 70s to low 80s across the interior and 60s to
70s along the coastline. Light offshore flow will continue
throughout the day but fire weather concerns remain low due to
relatively moist fuel.

.LONG TERM...
Issued at 305 AM PDT Tue Oct 28 2025
(Wednesday through Monday)

The pattern remains fairly stagnant through this weekend with upper
level ridging and high pressure dominating the forecast. We will
however still see some variation in temperatures this week. High
temperatures will peak on Wednesday with highs in the low to mid 80s
across the interior and upper 60s to 70s along the coastline. By
Thursday, the offshore wind gradient will weaken and gradually shift
onshore as a weak shortwave trough pushes into California. The
return of onshore winds will keep temperatures cooler Thursday and
Friday with highs in the 70s across the interior and upper 50s to
60s along the coastline. By Saturday and Sunday, surface high
pressure and ridging will again build over California with high
temperatures rising by a few degrees. Winds will be light and
variable over the weekend, shifting between onshore and offshore at
times, with highs in the mid 70s to low 80s across the interior and
60s along the coastline. Warmer temperatures will continue
through Monday before cooler weather returns midweek as an upper
level trough pushes into the West Coast. Initial guidance suggests
this system could bring some light rain to the area but this is
subject to change as it is over a week out still.
