...New AVIATION, MARINE...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 335 AM PDT Sat Aug 12 2023

A well defined marine layer this morning with extensive low clouds
will give way to mostly sunny skies this afternoon with seasonal
temperatures. Hotter temperatures develop inland Sunday through
midweek with 90s to near 100 while mild temperatures persist near
the coast and bays with onshore winds. The next trough arrives by
next Friday bringing a noted inland cooling trend next weekend.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 335 AM PDT Sat Aug 12 2023

The marine layer is 2000 feet deep this morning with low clouds
covering much of the North Bay, SF Bay and Peninsula and the usual
valleys around the Monterey Bay and Central Coast. A few mid and
high clouds continue to swirl around the region in association
with a very weak upper low that will remain centered in the
vicinity of Pt Conception the next day or so. Any convection
associated with this weak upper low and moisture is forecast to
remain over the Sierra today. Temperatures for the Bay Area will
be seasonal with 60s beaches, 70s around the bay and mainly 80s
inland except the most interior valleys will reach the low 90s.
Expect low clouds to spread inland again tonight with lows upper
50s to upper 60s except 70s in the hills. A recent lull in
northwest winds over the ocean has allowed our SST to warm to
around 59 degrees so our overnight lows have been notably more
mild the last several nights.

.LONG TERM...
(Sunday through Friday)
Issued at 335 AM PDT Sat Aug 12 2023

Main forecast focus and item of interest starting Sunday will be
much hotter temps for the interior locations, especially in the
North and East Bay. 850 mb temps today around 18-19 celsius will
warm to around 23-25 celsius by Sunday afternoon/evening then
peaking around 27 celsius early in the work week. This translates
to inland highs back into the upper 90s to around 100 degrees for
places like Livermore. A persistent onshore wind pattern and
marine layer will keep the metro areas seasonably warm with a
typical Bay Area micro-climate regime setting up that will feature
temps in the low 60s at the beaches with 102 or so for the hotter
interior locations. The synoptic pattern is a little atypical
with the main ridge and warm bubble associated with strong high
pressure over the Pacific Northwest that will extend southward
into Northern California. Meanwhile the nuisance upper low will
remain just offshore allowing the marine layer to stay in place.
Ironically the hottest 850 mb temps will be to our north, which
will coincide with weak northerly flow down the Sac Valley that
will help to bring the hottest temps to interior Napa, Alameda and
Contra Costa counties Sunday through Weds. Cyclonic circulation
around the low will likely induce some convection across the
Sierra and the coastal ranges of Northern California but not
seeing any activity for the Bay Area. Will continue to monitor for
any easterly flow that could come off the Sierra as shown by some
model solutions early in the week but those are outlier
scenarios.

By Friday the longwave pattern will shift with the PNA trending
negative and the PacNW ridge being replaced by a longwave trough
along the West Coast. This will bring renewed onshore breezes and
allow for an inland cooling trend as temps fall back into the 80s
Friday through Sunday of next weekend.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 528 AM PDT Sat Aug 12 2023

Borderline IFR-MVFR conditions will continue through morning hours
today as stratus has made its way further inland. Currently seeing
some drainage winds at KSJC and KSNS but will shift onshore early
this afternoon as sea breeze kicks in. Light to breezy westerly
winds will resume this afternoon. Low clouds will return this
evening and tonight. Models hinting at a later return for IFR-
MVFR cigs for SF Bay Area terminals (north of Monterey Bay).

Vicinity of SFO...Low clouds filled in overnight as winds shifted
back to NW. Tempo included through 15z to account for the
possibility of cigs dipping to IFR levels. Guidance is suggesting
that winds will shift N/NE again later this morning (similar to
yesterday morning), but expected to be fairly light. This also may
have a downslope drying effect and may erode the stratus quicker
than what is in the TAF currently (17z) so will have to monitor.
Low clouds return tonight with moderate timing of confidence, but
does look to be a later arrival.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO, but will likely see low
clouds scatter out sooner than the terminal.

Monterey Bay Terminals...Borderline MVFR-IFR cigs persist through
the late morning, scattering out first at KSNS and later for
KMRY. Light to breezy onshore winds expected this afternoon with
low clouds making another return around 02-03z this evening.

.MARINE...
(Today through Thursday)
Issued at 228 AM PDT Sat Aug 12 2023

Generally light winds across the waters south of Point Arena
through  the weekend, with the exception of winds through the
Golden Gate and  the Delta getting breezy each afternoon.
Northerly winds expected to  increase briefly late Sunday into
Monday over the northern outer  waters, but will diminish again
for the remainder of the upcoming  week. Moderate period southerly
swell at 11 to 13 seconds continues  in addition to moderate
period northwesterly swell which will slowly  build through early
next week. Longer period, light southwesterly  swell has also
arrived and will slowly diminish through the upcoming  week.
