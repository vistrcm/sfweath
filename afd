...New UPDATE, MARINE...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 338 AM PDT Mon Apr 7 2025

Light rain early today should taper off by mid-morning with
lingering clouds and cooler temperatures. Hazardous beach conditions
persist through late tonight. Warmer temperatures with minor
HeatRisk return Tuesday for the remainder of the work week.

.UPDATE...
Issued at 913 AM PDT Mon Apr 7 2025

Overcast conditions continue through the day, with light drizzle
possible in favored locations, especially along the coastal
ranges. With the light showers having generally dissipated, the
radar has been put into clear air mode, not because there`s no
chance for precipitation, but because clear air mode will be more
sensitive to the light drizzle that remains. Overall, rain totals
remain generally light with totals generally a few hundredths to a
tenth of an inch in the Bay Area, specifically in the northern
San Mateo Peninsula and the bayshore East Bay, with some slightly
higher totals in the North Bay valleys and the Oak Ridge RAWS
station in the Sonoma coastal ranges recording 0.52 inches of
rain.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 338 AM PDT Mon Apr 7 2025

Light rain will continue through sunrise across the North Bay and
eventually taper off by mid morning as a weak cold front moves
east across our area today. Clouds and cooler air today will
briefly interrupt the warmup we saw over the weekend. Temperatures
today will hover around normal, slightly warmer for some spots in
our inland valley areas. Zonal flow aloft aloft will be
established tonight with lows mostly in the mid/upper 40s. Long
period northwest swell will continue to pose a risk for sneaker
waves and riptides through late tonight.

&&

.LONG TERM...
(Tuesday through Sunday)
Issued at 338 AM PDT Mon Apr 7 2025

Zonal flow aloft will amplify into broader ridging beginning
tomorrow as temperatures climb above normal for the remainder of the
work week. The warmest days will be Wednesday and Thursday with many
inland Bay Area and Central Coast locations reaching 80 or higher.
The upper ridging shifts east by the weekend when an upper level
trough develops and moves inland well to our to our north. The
trough looks to become positively tilted as it reaches the west
coast and the strongest energy associated with the system will be
too far north for any meaningful precipitation if we see any at
all.
