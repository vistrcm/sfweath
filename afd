...New AVIATION, MARINE...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 238 AM PDT Fri Jun 16 2023

Low clouds early this morning clearing back to the coast by midday
with mild and sunny weather this afternoon. Marine layer surges
inland tonight with no big weather changes through Saturday.
Onshore winds increase Saturday night ushering in a fresh round of
marine stratus and cooler temperatures Sunday into Monday. Near to
slightly below normal temperatures continue for much of next weak
with a weak trough along the West Coast.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 238 AM PDT Fri Jun 16 2023

Marine layer has compressed slightly, especially over the North
Bay where much of Napa county is currently cloud free for the
moment. Depth is closer to 1800 feet in the North Bay with warmer
temps in the hills as noted with a 70 degree reading at the Oak
Ridge raws in northwest Sonoma county. Low clouds not covering the
Bay quite as extensively this morning and given the slight
compression were not seeing stratus push beyond the East Bay
hills. This all fits with the conceptual model of the East Pac
ridge nosing inland and compressing the marine layer slightly as
the airmass aloft warms. Low clouds will clear back to the coast
by late morning and leave another sunny and pleasant day across
the region with highs mainly in the 70s and lower 80s with no hot
temps of note. While the main ridge is nosing over NorCal there is
cyclonic flow over SoCal with even some dying nighttime
thunderstorms out near Death Valley. The cyclonic flow over SoCal
is allowing for a deeper marine layer for the Central Coast at
around 2400 feet with low clouds covering much of Monterey county
and expected to repeat that trend again tonight with areas of
drizzle.

.LONG TERM...
(Saturday through Thursday)
Issued at 238 AM PDT Fri Jun 16 2023

For weekend planning, Saturday will be the nicer day of the
upcoming weekend with no big changes forecast for Saturday as the
synoptic pattern wont change much. Morning stratus will clear back
to the coast with seasonably mild and dry weather Saturday
afternoon for outdoor activities with inland highs in the
comfortable zone ranging from the 70s to lower 80s for the
North/South/East Bay interior valleys.

There are some meteorologically significant changes in the
pattern that will start to show up as early as Saturday evening
for the Bay Area. An unseasonably deep trough will push into the
PacNW by Sunday. As early as Saturday evening we should see a
deepening of the marine layer and increasing onshore winds on the
coast from Sonoma to Half Moon Bay. It`ll be a blustery evening
in the City Saturday night as the marine layer ushers through the
Golden Gate and pushes into the East Bay hills by Sunday morning.

A deepening marine layer and onshore winds as the trough dives
down on Sunday may keep stratus around the Bay for much of Sunday
with inland temperatures mainly staying in the 70s with steady
onshore flow all day.

By Monday the base of the trough will be around Mt Shasta with
very cold air aloft for late June just north of the region. ECMWF
EFI supports this showing Monday as an abnormally cool day with
highs in the 60s and lower 70s and due to the cold air aloft no
inversion layer with cooler temps in the hills (as compared to say
this morning). Persistent onshore winds will keep breezy
conditions in place on Monday though the inversion layer should
mix out with more sunshine near the coast.

A general trough stays along the West Coast Tuesday through Friday
of next week keep temperatures near or slightly below normal. Main
message continues to be no hot weather and a continued dry weather
for the Bay Area.

Taking a look at the latest cluster analysis the consensus keeps
the West Coast trough in place at least through the weekend of
June 24-25th meaning temps staying on the cool side of normal.
Good news for keeping fire danger in check and a relatively slow
melt of the Sierra snowpack. No hint of any impending hot spells
for not only the Bay Area but most of CA.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 421 AM PDT Fri Jun 16 2023

Extensive MVFR-IFR stratus across the Sonoma Valley, the East Bay
and the San Mateo Peninsula, and the Monterey Bay region down
into the Salinas Valley and east into Gilroy and Hollister.
Stratus coverage continues to extend through the night, before
starting to retreat around 16-17Z. Confidence in fog at STS has
decreased and is not expected to prevail for more than a couple of
hours. Winds this afternoon will be from a generally westerly
pattern, with speeds up to 10-15 knots. Stratus begins to build
back this evening with most interior terminals with MVFR-IFR
ceilings by the end of the TAF period.

Vicinity of SFO...While MVFR-IFR stratus has set up across the Bay
Area, SFO itself is still reporting VFR. Previous experience has
shown that this pattern could keep SFO itself stubbornly clear, so
confidence in an MVFR ceiling over SFO tonight has decreased. If
stratus forms over the terminal, clearing to VFR is expected
around 16Z. West-northwest winds this afternoon with gusts up to
20-25 knots. Currently expecting MVFR-IFR stratus to return to the
terminal around 6Z tonight.

SFO Bridge Approach...Stratus is already covering most of the SF
Bay with a clear patch around SFO. Otherwise similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...MVFR-IFR stratus persists tonight. Stratus
clears out late Friday morning around 18-19Z, moderate confidence
(30-40% probability) that MRY clears out. Winds on Friday afternoon
will be from the west-northwest at around 10-15 knots. IFR stratus
returns around 2-3Z, with clearing delayed until after the TAF
period. Low to moderate confidence in LIFR conditions developing at
MRY.

.MARINE...
(Today through Wednesday)
Issued at 421 AM PDT Fri Jun 16 2023

A weak surface cyclonic circulation develops over the coastal
waters today, resulting in southerly winds through Saturday
afternoon with exception of gusty northerly to northwesterly winds
continuing over the far northwestern waters. By Saturday evening
gusty northwesterly winds will develop over the entire coastal
waters, lasting through early next week. Gale force gusts will be
possible in the far northwestern outer waters. Afternoon and
evening gusty winds are forecast each day across the San Francisco
Bay mainly north of the Bay Bridge to the Delta. Seas remain a
mix of long period southerly swell with a shorter period
northwesterly swell.
