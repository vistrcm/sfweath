...New UPDATE, MARINE...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 334 AM PDT Wed Jul 10 2024

Last peak of the heat wave starts today and lasts through
Friday. Cool down through the weekend with near normal temps by the
start of next week.

&&

.UPDATE...
Issued at 822 AM PDT Wed Jul 10 2024

Widespread stratus continues to impact the region this morning with
low clouds spreading inland into most interior valleys. This is all
thanks to a marine layer of around 1,500-1,8000 feet in depth at
this hour. However, as we move through this warm up, it should
compress to around 1,000 feet later tonight and into tomorrow. These
low clouds impacting the region should mix out and retreat to the
coast by this afternoon giving way to the much anticipated warm up.
Coastal areas are expected to remain in the 60`s and 70`s while the
interior reaches as high as 100-105 degrees. The ongoing forecast
remains on track with no updates anticipated this morning.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 334 AM PDT Wed Jul 10 2024

Deep marine layer this morning promoting abundant stratus
and even some drizzle (on this forecasters drive into work last
night). However, the marine layer compresses through today as the
ridge is reinforced over the West. Heat Advisories and Excessive
Heat Warnings go into effect today for inland areas and the Bay
shoreline. Moderate HeatRisk across most areas in the heat
highlights, and isolated areas of major HeatRisk, most notable in
the inland East Bay and Santa Clara county.

&&

.LONG TERM...
(Thursday through Tuesday)
Issued at 334 AM PDT Wed Jul 10 2024

Thursday is expected to mark the peak of these next three
days of heat. The aforementioned areas of moderate and major
HeatRisk remain with isolated areas of extreme noted in the major
risk areas. Not notably different day-to-day in terms of overall
risk since some lower elevation areas will see some cooling
overnight, and we are pretty confidently dealing with only three
days with a sufficient cool down afterwards. However, the magnitude
of the temperatures will still be problematic for those sensitive to
heat and those recreating or working outdoors. Continue to use
caution and practice heat safety into this weekend. By the weekend,
temperatures start their decline as the ridge migrates to the NW and
a deep upper low digs into the Gulf of Alaska. This should set up a
reliable onshore flow pattern which would bring us cooler air and
some better moisture return from the seabreeze. Temperatures are
expected to be closer to seasonal normals by the start of next week.
As of this morning, heat highlights still look good to keep as
is...expiring Friday night.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 450 AM PDT Wed Jul 10 2024

Widespread stratus has returned throughout the Bay Area and Central
Coast. LIFR to IFR conditions will persist through mid to late
morning. Current thinking is that stratus will dissipate slightly
later compared to yesterday due to a deeper and more expansive
marine layer. Ensemble guidance indicates some impacts to visibility
are possible, particularly for the North Bay and Central Coast, but
confidence remains low on visibilities 515.

     Excessive Heat Warning until 8 PM PDT Friday for CAZ517-518.

PZ...Small Craft Advisory from 3 PM this afternoon to 9 PM PDT this
     evening for Pt Arena to Pt Reyes 0-10 nm.

     Small Craft Advisory until 9 PM PDT Thursday for Pt Arena to Pt
     Reyes 10-60 NM.

     Small Craft Advisory until 3 AM PDT Thursday for Pigeon Pt to Pt
     Pinos 10-60 NM.
