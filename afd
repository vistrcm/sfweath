...New AVIATION, MARINE, BEACHES...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 1242 AM PDT Wed Oct 18 2023

Heat Advisories are in effect for portions of the Bay Area and
Central Coast for today into Thursday. Hotter temperatures persist
through late week before cooling ensues this weekend. Hazardous
marine and beach conditions developing today with sneaker waves,
high surf, and rip currents a concern for beachgoers. If you have
beach plans please use caution and remember to never turn your
back on the ocean.

.UPDATE...
Issued at 114 AM PDT Wed Oct 18 2023

Visibility has rapidly decreased across southern Monterey Bay and
the northern Salinas Valley. A Dense Fog Advisory was issued for
these areas through 10 AM this morning. Please travel carefully
and allow for extra commute time in these areas.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 1242 AM PDT Wed Oct 18 2023

Moisture channel imagery early this morning reveals very dry mid-
level air moving into the region in association with a mid to upper
high pressure area nosing in from the eastern Pacific. Nighttime
microphysics imagery noted low clouds and locally dense fog
extending from Pacific Grove down the Big Sur coast and within the
northern Salinas Valley. Locally dense fog should remain a concern
in these areas into the mid to late morning hours. Looking forward,
a consensus of the deterministic models and their ensembles suggest
that the center of the 590+ dm mid-level ridge will locate over our
area today, with boundary layer winds shifting towards a light
offshore direction by tonight. As a low-level thermal trough sets up
along the CA coast, projected 850 mb model temperatures should reach
the 22-25 deg C range by this evening, which is above the 90th
percentile values for this time of year per KOAK sounding
climatology. Given this setup, opted to go above the 50th percentile
values from National Blend of Models for maximum temperature, with
advertised highs ranging from the lower to mid 80s along the coast,
to the lower to mid 90s inland. Given light offshore flow tonight,
expect cooling to be somewhat limited in the hills with lows
dropping into the 60s to lower 70s. Valley and coastal/bayside
readings will be a bit cooler however, with lows in these areas
dropping into the mid 50s to around 60. A Heat Advisory goes into
effect for the South Bay, Santa Cruz Mountains, and inland portions
of the Central Coast this morning, with the risk expanding into much
of the Bay Area by tonight. This is based on the projected moderate
to major HeatRisk which will create hazardous conditions for heat
sensitive populations. For reference here are a few tips for keeping
safe during the heat:

* Stay hydrated and drink plenty of fluids.
* Wear lightweight, light-colored clothing.
* Reduce time spent outdoors or stay in the shade.
* Never leave people or pets unattended in vehicles.

.LONG TERM...
(Thursday through Tuesday)
Issued at 1242 AM PDT Wed Oct 18 2023

Thursday:

The center of the upper ridge will shift to our east, however warm
low-level thicknesses and offshore/downsloping flow will be the
rule. Given the rather warm start during the morning, expect
temperatures to skyrocket during the morning to early afternoon
hours. This will be the peak of the heat event, and look for high
temperatures to reach the 80s to around 90 along the coast, with 80s
to mid 90s for most inland areas. Given the climatology of this late-
season heat event, HeatRisk values will reach the moderate to high
range across much of the region. And for this reason Heat Advisories
will remain in effect for much of the area into Thursday evening.

Friday through Tuesday:

The upper ridge will push east of the area with a return to onshore
flow and upper troughing. Temperatures will remain seasonally warm
on Friday, before cooling over the weekend. Small chances for light
rain and/or drizzle remain in the forecast for Saturday night into
Sunday as a weak frontal system pushes through the region. Quiet and
drier post-frontal conditions return for early next week.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 345 AM PDT Wed Oct 18 2023

Offshore winds are developing, WMC-SFO and ACV-SFO pressure gradients
are 7.9 mb and 3.1 mb respectively. The marine layer is compressed
to 400 feet per profiler data and will remain compressed through today,
tonight and early Thursday due to large scale sinking and warming air.
Near high confidence VFR except fog /VLIFR-IFR/ on the immediate coast
and patchy valley fog /VLIFR-IFR/ this morning.

Vicinity of SFO...VFR. Light and variable west wind becoming light
northeast early this morning, then northwest near 10 knots late this
afternoon and evening.

SFO Bridge Approach...VFR.

Monterey Bay Terminals...VLIFR-IFR in patchy fog near the Monterey
Bay, gradually clearing to VFR due to east to southeast winds to 5
to 10 knots this morning. VFR today. Patchy fog /VLIFR-IFR/ developing
tonight and Thursday morning.

.MARINE...
(Tonight through next Sunday)
Issued at 337 AM PDT Wed Oct 18 2023

A long period northwest swell will propagate through the coastal
waters today through Thursday. Swell heights will peak early
Thursday to around 12-14 feet at 17-19 seconds, resulting in
elevated seas and dangerous high surf. Swell slowly diminishes
into the weekend. A strong upper level high pressure system will
move eastward across the coastal waters today and tonight. A low
pressure system will move across the eastern Pacific bringing a
chance of rain to the coastal waters and bays over the weekend.

&&

.BEACHES...
Issued at 324 AM PDT Wed Oct 18 2023

A long period northwest swell will bring hazardous conditions for
beachgoers in the form of sneaker waves and large surf. An
enhanced risk for rip currents will also exist. Conditions will
deteriorate on Wednesday with the peak of the wave activity
arriving on Thursday. High surf will persist into Friday before
subsiding. Use extreme caution and remain out of the water to
avoid hazardous swimming conditions. Remember to never turn your
back on the ocean.
