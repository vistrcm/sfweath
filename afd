.SHORT TERM...
Issued at 1211 PM PST Thu Dec 25 2025
(This evening through Friday)

The active weather continues through this evening. While the
widespread damaging winds have generally eased to a strong breeze,
there are still reports of gusts near 50 mph across the Bay Area.
The main threat today is possible severe thunderstorms. There has
been some scattered storms through the morning, particularly in
the North Bay with small hail and an unconfirmed funnel cloud
reported. The first organized band of showers and possible
thunderstorms is reaching San Francisco now. This will gradually
slide south through the afternoon. The big event today will push
through this evening, around 4-7 PM. A short wave with a robust
low level jet will help trigger what looks like a very organized,
fast moving N-S oriented line of thunderstorms. The early
thunderstorms were somewhat unexpected and we decided to launch a
special 18Z balloon to get better ground truth on how unstable the
atmosphere actually is. The result was somewhat mixed. The
overall CAPE was 170 J/kg, lower than some CAMs analyzed. But the
distribution of was favorable, with most of the instability above
the freezing level, but below 3 km. Overall the parameters were
good for both high shear low CAPE tornados, and QLCS severe wind
gusts. There is actually a very good signal on radar for a
possible waterspout over the Monterey Bay at the moment,
increasing confidence that the atmosphere can support tornadic
activity today.

.LONG TERM...
Issued at 1211 PM PST Thu Dec 25 2025
(Friday night through next Wednesday)

Starting Friday, winds and shower activity will gradually
decrease as the low pressure system offshore opens up into a
trough and moves into northern Oregon. The associated surface
trough axis will move across the Bay Area Friday evening. This
will finally flip the winds back to northerly, bringing drier,
cooler weather for the weekend. The 1000-500 mb thickness actually
increases this weekend, with the cooling coming mainly from
enhanced radiation during in the cloudless nights. Sunday through
Tuesday look particularly calm, clear and cool as a 500 mb ridge
sets in. The next troughing pattern looks probable on the 1st or
2nd, just in time for King Tides. There`s no strong signal for
major impacts yet, but the CW3E ECCC AR Activity tool shows higher
than normal chances for atmospheric rivers through the first half
of January.

.AVIATION...
(00Z TAFS)
Issued at 513 PM PST Thu Dec 25 2025

A strong cold front continues to move eastward across the coastal
waters resulting in showers and widely scattered thunderstorms.
Expect rapidly changing weather conditions across the Bay Area and
the north Central Coast through mid to late evening at the latest
with quickly moving downpours and additional thunderstorms which
may approach severe criteria of wind gusts to 50 knots (58 mph) or
greater; conditions favor low level wind shear (LLWS), will add
LLWS to TAFs as needed. The cold front will continue to press
eastward out of the area overnight with winds gradually easing
behind the front. It`s VFR except MVFR-IFR in passing downpours,
conditions easing overnight after the front moves to the east of
the forecast area. Cooler air mass arriving may still bring widely
scattered to scattered showers tonight and Friday.

Vicinity of SFO...Strong southerly winds, downpours and thunderstorms
are also possible through mid evening to possibly late evening.
Conditions easing overnight behind the passage of the cold front.
Generally VFR for the period except MVFR-IFR in downpours.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...Strong southerly winds, downpours and
thunderstorms are also possible through mid evening to possibly
late evening. Conditions easing overnight behind the passage of
the cold front. Generally VFR for the period except MVFR-IFR in
downpours.

.MARINE...
(Tonight through next Tuesday)
Issued at 350 PM PST Thu Dec 25 2025

...HAZARDOUS MARINE CONDITIONS CONTINUE INTO EARLY FRIDAY...
Southeast gales continue across the coastal waters and will
persist into Friday morning. These dangerous winds are accompanied
by a chance for thunderstorms and possible waterspouts through
the evening hours. Very rough, choppy seas will accompany these
gales and linger through the day Friday, reinforced by a moderate
westerly swell. If your vessel is not able to handle these
conditions return to port or seek protected waters as soon as
possible.

.BEACHES...
Issued at 350 PM PST Thu Dec 25 2025

A Beach Hazards Statement continues for the coast through 4 AM
Friday. The main concerns include:blowing and drifting sand and
wind waves up to 20 ft. The drifting sand and increased sea spray
will also result in poor visibilities, affecting water rescues.
Increased coastal erosion will be possible as well.

A High Surf Advisory is then valid for the coast from 4 AM to 10
PM Friday. For the High Surf Advisory: expect large breaking waves
up to 25 feet, strong rip currents and sneaker waves. Dangerous
swimming and surfing conditions and localized beach erosion can be
expected. Sneaker waves can sweep across the shoreline without
warning, pulling people into the sea from rocks, jetties and
beaches. Large breaking waves can overpower swimmers resulting in
significant physical injury and increase the risk of drowning.

Inexperienced swimmers should remain out of the water due to
dangerous surf conditions.

Stay off of jetties, piers, rocks, and other waterside
infrastructure. Remain out of the water to avoid hazardous surf
and NEVER turn your back on the ocean. Monitor local weather,
surf and tide forecasts at www.weather.gov/mtr.
