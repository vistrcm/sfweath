...New AVIATION...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 253 AM PDT Tue Jul 30 2024

Near normal temperatures today as a gradual warming trend kicks
off into the weekend. Low chance for isolated dry lightning Friday
into Saturday, mainly east into the Central Valley and Sierra.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 253 AM PDT Tue Jul 30 2024

Fairly deep marine layer as the sun set last night, but things are
changing this morning. Some signs of compression for a few
locations around the area as patchy fog develops. This is one of
our initial hints that a warm up is on the way as high pressure
builds gradually aloft. However, the continued presence of the
marine layer, thanks to persistent onshore flow, will allow for
cloud cover again tonight. This will help to moderate our
temperatures a bit and not warm up as quickly as we would
otherwise.

.LONG TERM...
(Wednesday through Monday)
Issued at 253 AM PDT Tue Jul 30 2024

Speaking of onshore flow, it`s going to be hanging around through
most of the warm up, so despite being sunny during the afternoons,
the coastal areas will still be under the influence of the marine
layer. This will keep the coast from warming up much, if at all,
through the period. Temperatures across the rest of the area look
to peak around Saturday with highs in the mid-90s to 100 inland,
generally 80-90 for lower elevations near the Bay, and 60s to
around 70 along the coastal areas.

As the high pressure shifts northward, this opens the door for a
weak push of monsoonal moisture to make its way into central CA.
Ensemble guidance is favoring the Central Valley and Sierra to see
the bulk of the moisture, but attention will need to be paid to
our eastern zones that border the Central Valley. At this time,
there does not appear to be enough mid-level instability to
support high-based convection across our zones. For now, retaining
just a mention for the chance of dry lightning given that it is a
low probability, high impact scenario. Long range guidance
continues to advertise a pattern conducive for additional plumes
of monsoonal moisture through the next 10-14 days, so we will be
keeping a close eye and adjusting messaging as needed.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 417 AM PDT Tue Jul 30 2024

IFR-LIFR ceilings and scattered fog across the terminals this
morning. Although the compression of the marine layer tonight has
limited the inland extent of ceilings, particularly in the South
Bay, it has also resulted in lower ceilings and visibilities than
the previous forecast. The stratus deck mixes out late this morning
with the immediate coast socked in through the TAF period. Breezy
onshore winds develop this afternoon and evening before becoming
light overnight, with stratus returning to the inland regions as the
winds diminish. Beyond the 24-hour TAF period, some model output is
suggesting a somewhat speedier mixing out of stratus Wednesday
morning; confidence remains low at this time.

Vicinity of SFO... IFR stratus continues through late this morning
with westerly winds up to 20 knots developing in the afternoon.
Stratus returns early on Tuesday evening and persists through
Wednesday morning, at or around the end of the TAF period.

SFO Bridge Approach... Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals... Marine layer stratus continues through the
morning, with LIFR ceilings lifting to IFR around 16Z. A brief
clearing should take place this afternoon as breezy onshore winds
develop, before stratus returns in the early evening and persists
through the end of the TAF period.

.MARINE...
(Today through Sunday)
Issued at 253 AM PDT Tue Jul 30 2024

Gentle to moderate northwesterly breezes with fresh gusts will
continue through the forecast period. Pretty mild conditions over
the waters with significant wave heights in the 5-7 feet range
through the forecast period.
