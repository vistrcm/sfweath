...New AVIATION...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 335 AM PST Fri Jan 3 2025

Rain chances increase throughout the day, starting in the North Bay
counties and then working its way south. Dry weather is expected on
Saturday and then holds for the foreseeable future.

&&

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 335 AM PST Fri Jan 3 2025

A cold front will work its way through the region today, leading to
widespread rain. Amounts haven`t deviated too much from yesterday`s
update. For the North Bay counties, look for rainfall amounts of
0.30"-0.60" in the valleys and up to 1.00" in the coastal ranges and
higher elevations across the region. As you head southward, forecast
rainfall amounts drastically taper lower with 0.30" for the City of
San Francisco to less than 0.10" for Monterey. However, locally
greater totals are expected in the favored coastal ranges from the
Santa Cruz Mountains to the Santa Lucia Range. Some minor rises on
creeks and rivers will be possible in the North Bay, with the latest
forecasts keeping items at or below action state. Rain is expected
to clear the area this evening, though there could be some lingering
post frontal showers. As noted prior, winds aren`t expected to be
particularly noteworthy. Coastal areas may see gusts up to 20-30mph,
while the higher terrain could see gusts up to 40 mph.

.LONG TERM...
(Saturday through Thursday)
Issued at 335 AM PST Fri Jan 3 2025

No major changes to the extended forecast as ensemble and cluster
analysis shows ridging holding through the second week of January.
Look for a warming and drying trend during this period and the
possibility for some gusty offshore winds near mid week. Opted to
adjust the winds up slightly in response to the ensemble output.
Will need to watch and see how the gradients behave as the inside
slider shortwave trough slides through interior NorCal and pushes
south.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 418 AM PST Fri Jan 3 2025

Ceiling at KSTS has dropped to MVFR as rain has begun to spread
across the North Bay, with the remainder of the terminals currently
at VFR, following suit as light rain moves onshore across the
rest of our area through sunrise into mid-morning. Visibilities
may drop to MVFR at times as stronger showers move across the
terminals today, but should rebound quickly. Winds will stay south
to southeasterly ahead of the frontal passage with southwest to
west winds expected once it passes. Good confidence from previous
forecast that ceilings will start to improve after 00Z. A low (<
10%) chance of thunderstorms across Sonoma County this morning
into early afternoon continues but confidence remains too low to
include in STS TAF.

Vicinity of SFO...Ceilings are VFR at TAF issuance as rain begins to
move onshore over the Bay Area with MVFR ceilings expected around
sunrise. Lower visibilities are expected as more widespread rain
moves through the area but visibility should rebound quickly after
showers have moved out. South/Southeasterly winds will become more
westerly after frontal later this morning.

SFO Bridge Approach... Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...VFR to continue through sunrise until
around mid-morning when rain begins to spread across the Monteray
Bay area and moves inland through the remainder of the day. Once
ceilings drop to MVFR, they`re expected to remain there until early
this evening and gradually improve in the post frontal environment,
when surface winds become more westerly.

.MARINE...
(Today through Wednesday)
Issued at 335 AM PST Fri Jan 3 2025

A cold front will bring moderate southerly winds and widespread
light rainfall today. Light rain, currently across the North Bay
will spread south through the day, with scattered showers possible
after frontal passage later this afternoon and continuing into the
evening. There is a low, less than ten percent, chance of
thunderstorms this morning through early afternoon. Rain chances
diminish early this evening with dry weather expected through the
remainder of the week. The moderate period westerly swell and
rough  seas will create hazardous conditions for small crafts
today and  Saturday with significant wave heights between 12 to
13ft. Seas ease briefly on Sunday, then begin to build again late
Monday  into the middle of next week.

.BEACHES...
Issued at 1219 PM PST Thu Jan 2 2025

Wave model forecasts indicate long period westerly swell arriving
along the coastline from Sonoma County to Monterey County Friday
night, decreasing to a moderate period westerly swell Saturday. We
have issued a Beach Hazard Statement from 9 AM Friday to 9 PM
Friday due to increased risk for sneaker waves. Then, High Surf
Advisory from 9 PM Friday to 3 AM Sunday due to breaking waves of
18-25 feet (all coastal locations expect the northern Monterey Bay
which will remain in a Beach Hazard Statement).

Also at the current time, wave model forecasts are showing a newly
arriving long period westerly swell Monday into Tuesday. As always
whenever there is increasing surf - remember to never turn your back
on the ocean and stay out of the water. Again please stay tuned to any
further updates for late week, additionally for early next week.
