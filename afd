...New UPDATE, MARINE...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 257 AM PST Fri Feb 9 2024

High pressure continues aloft with a pleasant weekend in store.
Chilly overnight temperatures for the next few mornings especially
across the interior. A more unsettled pattern with the potential for
widespread rainfall towards the end of next week.

.UPDATE...
Issued at 852 AM PST Fri Feb 9 2024

It was a chilly morning with lows dipping into the mid 30s
across much of the interior with reports of frost even in coastal
regions such as Santa Cruz (where temps dipped into the 36-38
degree range). For the rest of today, overall benign weather is
expected with the exception of minor coastal flooding in low-
lying, vulnerable bayside locations (such as portions of Marin
County along the 101 corridor) due to high astronomical tides.
High tide will peak around 10:30 AM this morning, so the worst
coastal flood impacts are expected then. A Coastal Flood Advisory
remains in effect through Saturday morning to account for minor
coastal flooding during high tide.

High pressure will start to build in today, with ridging persisting
into next week. This will result in a subtle warming trend this
weekend into next week. Forecast is on track and no updates needed
this morning.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 257 AM PST Fri Feb 9 2024

Frost Advisories remain in effect until 9 AM PST this morning for
higher elevations and interior portions of the Bay Area and Central
Coast. Additionally, a Coastal Flood Advisory is in effect for areas
surrounding the San Francisco Bay until 1 PM PST Saturday, flooding
is most likely between 8 AM and 12 PM each day during peak high
tide.

For today, high temperatures will generally be in the mid-to-upper
50s with colder temperatures in the regions peaks (upper 30s to
lower 40s). Tonight, expect the greatest potential for frost
development to remain confined to the interior portions of the
Central Coast.

&&

.LONG TERM...
(Saturday through Thursday)
Issued at 257 AM PST Fri Feb 9 2024

A gradual warming trend is expected this weekend with day time
maximum temperatures in the upper 50s to lower 60s. Overnight
temperatures will also be on a gradual increase by the upcoming work
week. By Wednesday, we can expect temperatures to warm into the low-
to-mid 60s as a mid-winter ridge remains in place. Unfortunately
this feature will be short lived and will shift east by Thursday or
Friday, opening the door to another active period of weather.

From previous forecaster: "The Climate Prediction Center has
highlighted portions of California, once again, in their 8-14
graphics with a high risk of heavy precipitation, moderate risk of
high winds, and flooding possible. The time window is sometime
between Feb 16-21. Models have been trending this way over the last
couple days, but we are still too far out to resolve details
regarding impacts to the Bay Area and Central Coast. The takeaway is
to utilize the good weather days this weekend and into next week to
prepare for a potentially impactful pattern late next week through
Washington`s Birthday holiday weekend."
