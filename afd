Stratocumulus clouds persist across the higher elevations of the

Advisory has been allowed to expire, with the gradual warming
trend leaving no need for a renewed Advisory on Friday morning.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 123 AM PDT Thu Apr 3 2025

A Frost Advisory is in effect through 9 AM for the North Bay
Interior Valleys and the Interior Central Coast. This cold airmass
will also be responsible for putting three climate sites daily
minimum temperatures in jeopardy this morning: San Rafael (SARC1)
forecast is 42 degrees with a previous record of 39 degrees in 2010,
San Francisco Downtown (SFOC1) forecast is 44 degrees with a
previous record of 41 degrees in 2001, and Oakland Museum (OAMC1)
forecast is 44 degrees with a previous record of 43 degrees in 2003.
Light winds and remnant moisture will allow for fog development
through the morning hours, so ensure to use your low-beam
headlights, drive slowly, and keep your distance from other
vehicles. The warming and drying trend continues today, but
temperatures will still remain several degrees below average. Cold
conditions will return overnight largely remaining confined to the
higher terrain; nonetheless, ensure the protection of people, pets,
plants, and pipes.

.LONG TERM...
(Friday through Wednesday)
Issued at 123 AM PDT Thu Apr 3 2025

A high-amplitude longwave ridge of high pressure will build into the
West from the Eastern Pacific Ocean through Saturday. At the
surface, this will translate to the return of above seasonal normal
temperatures and minor HeatRisk. As a reminder, this level of heat
affects primarily those individuals extremely sensitive to heat,
especially when outdoors without effective cooling and/or adequate
hydration. An upper-level low will shift the ridge eastward
(effectively flattening the pattern to zonal flow) Sunday into
Monday with a cold front slated to bring precipitation of up to
0.25" to the North Bay. The ridge rebuilds and begins to retrograde
Tuesday with temperatures climbing to as much as 15 degrees above
average by Wednesday.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 414 AM PDT Thu Apr 3 2025

Patchy strato-cu hugging portions of the higher terrain around the
region this morning, but actual impacts to terminals is minimal.
Most of the terminals are VFR this morning and are expected to
remain VFR over the next 24 hours. Winds are light this morning,
but similar to yesterday they`ll increase this afternoon out of
the NW. KAPC did report some patchy fog earlier, but latest
satellite and 5min obs show it has dissipated. Overall confidence
is moderate to high.

Vicinity of SFO...VFR. Light this AM through the rush and then
increasing NW with gusts 20kt heading into the PM rush. Some
patchy clouds hugging the Berkley hills, but SFO should be fine.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...Patchy cigs drifting over KMRY at times
due to solid moisture feature over Monterey Bay.

.MARINE...
(Today through Tuesday)
Issued at 856 AM PDT Thu Apr 3 2025

High pressure over the Eastern Pacific will maintain moderate
northerly winds over the coastal waters through the end of this
week. Winds will be locally stronger over the outer waters and
north of Point Reyes. These stronger winds will result in steeper
wind waves and hazardous conditions. Winds and seas will diminish
by Friday. A longer period swell will arrive late this weekend
with increased shoaling near the coast, bays, and harbor
entrances.

.BEACHES...
Issued at 414 AM PDT Thu Apr 3 2025

As sensible weather conditions improve with warmer weather over
the weekend and early next week beachgoer traffic may increase. As
such, beachgoers should be mindful as a longer period swell
arrives Sunday. This longer period will result in hazardous beach
conditions with increased sneaker wave risk, rip current risk,
and larger shore break. A Beach Hazard statement will likely be
need as Sunday nears. Beachgoers should stay off of jetties and
rocks, keep pets on a leash, wear a life jacket, and never turn
your back on the ocean!
