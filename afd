.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 1205 AM PST Thu Feb 13 2025

The atmospheric river has arrived! Major impacts are expected
through the day as the moderate to heavy rain continues, winds
increase, and thunderstorm chances arrive. The biggest risk is
localized flooding and damaging winds, especially through the
first half of the day. Conditions will improve Friday. Some light
rain is expected in the North Bay on Sunday, but overall the
pattern will dry out over the next week.

  effect from 10 PM Wed to 10 AM Fri (coastal)

* High Surf Warning in effect 3 PM Thu to 3 AM Sat

METEOROLOGY:

We are in the middle of an atmospheric river, driven by a storm force
low pressure system off the coast of far northern California.
The associated warm front is moving ashore as I type this.
Despite the fact that it`s 1230 AM, it`s currently 61 degrees in
Monterey. That`s the warmest it`s been in a week. As the warm
front moves through and the cold front approaches over the next
couple hours, rain intensity will increase to around 1.0-1.5" per
hour along the coastal mountains, and roughly half that in the
valleys. These high rain rates will cause localized flooding and
likely trigger some shallow landslides. The wind speed is also
increasing, with current gusts of 30-50 mph observed in higher
terrain, and 20-40 mph along the coast. Winds are expected to
increase over the next several hours as the cold front approaches.
High resolution guidance is still developing a SW`rly 50-60 kt
low-level jet at 850 mb from around 2 AM through noon. With the
high rain rates, these winds should have no trouble mixing down to
the surface at times, and widespread gusts of 40-50 mph are
expected across the area, with 60-70 mph possible along the coast
and higher elevations. The cold front is expected to move through
around sunrise, ushering a colder and drier air mass. The PWAT
will drop from around 1.2" to 0.8", while the 500 mb temperature
will drop from around freezing to -10F. While the drier air will
cause the total rainfall to slowly taper off, individual showers
will strengthen as the cold upper air decreases the stability and
allows convection to become the primary precipitation mode. This
threat is highest from late morning through late afternoon. The
Storm Prediction Center continues to show the risk for
thunderstorms throughout the cwa today.

IMPACTS:

Heavy rain is expected to continue for several hours. Minor flooding
impacts are ongoing across the majority of the cwa. We have not
seen any flash flooding yet, but that risk still exist through the
morning for urban areas. Strong wind gusts combined with saturated
soils will likely lead to downed trees and power outages. Numerous
flood advisories are in effect, and the flood watch continues
through 10 PM Saturday as the rivers absorb the run-off. A High
Wind Warning is in effect for coastal areas, with a Wind Advisory
in effect for inland areas, both through 10 AM Friday. We will
likely see notable rises on many major rivers, and the Russian
River at Guerneville and the San Lorenzo River have the highest
chances of going into flood stage. The San Lorenzo is of
particular concern given the rain so far, and how flashy that
basin is. The river gauge is already reporting a sharp rise.
Other coastal areas outside of the Santa Cruz Mtns may not see the
same degree of shallow landsliding, but nonetheless will still
have impacts due to downed trees and powerlines, especially areas
near the Marin headlands, Big Sur/Carmel coast, and Monterey
Peninsula. The commute this morning will undoubtedly be nasty and
downright dangerous in some cases (thinking Hwy 17 in
particular). When all is said and done, the North Bay will likely
end up with 2 to 4 inches, and the Bay Area will see a range of
1.5 to 3 inches depending on if you`re in the South Bay rain
shadow or not. The Santa Cruz Mtns and Big Sur coast will be the
winners with 4 to 7 inches, locally up to 8-10. Despite some
locations seeing some of the lower end of rainfall amounts, wind
is still expected to pose a threat to life and property through
the day.

.LONG TERM...
(Friday through Wednesday)
Issued at 1205 AM PST Thu Feb 13 2025

Showers taper off Friday and the sun will even come out in the
afternoon. Saturday will start cold with mid-30s inland and
mid-40s along the coast. Saturday will stay dry before a much
weaker disturbance moves through on Sunday. We are only expecting
light rain from this, mainly confined to the North Bay. Otherwise
next week looks dry and mild. Long range guidance is somewhat
split, but the majority of solutions point to a much drier second
half of February as our roller-coaster rainy season continues.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 325 AM PST Thu Feb 13 2025

Stratiform rain covers the forecast region with ceilings generally
in the MVFR to VFR with mid-level cloud range, with a couple of
terminals along the coast and in the North Bay valleys going into
the IFR-LIFR range. Visibilities are more variable with IFR
visibilities being seen in areas of particularly intense rain. The
stratiform rain begins to break up later this morning, with shower
activity through the day and overnight into Friday. There is limited
confidence in the ceiling forecasts today due to differing model
outputs, but widespread clearing to VFR is not expected before the
end of the TAF period. Winds will be strong and gusty through the
TAF period, with the winds shifting from a southeasterly flow into a
southwesterly flow later this morning. The gustiest winds are
expected through the morning, with LLWS possible across the region,
before the gust speeds abate towards the end of the day.

Vicinity of SFO... Rain and gusty winds continue through the TAF
period, with the winds remaining southwesterly through Friday
morning. Currently stratiform rain is expected to break up into
showers later this morning through the end of the TAF period, with
the shower coverage decreasing overnight into Friday morning.
Gustiest winds continue through the morning before the gust speeds
begin to abate through the TAF period. MVFR ceilings will continue
today with low confidence of the clouds lifting above VFR thresholds
Friday morning.

SFO Bridge Approach... Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals... Gusty winds and MVFR ceilings through the
TAF period. Gusts peak later this morning before beginning to abate
through the rest of the day. Stratiform rain breaks up into showers
later this morning through the end of the TAF period.

.MARINE...
(Today through Tuesday)
Issued at 325 AM PST Thu Feb 13 2025

Rain and gale force winds continue over the waters with isolated
storm force gusts possible. Moderate period westerly swell builds
through Friday morning with very rough to high seas expected.
Heavy rainfall continues Friday morning with a slight chance for
thunderstorms later today.

.BEACHES...
Issued at 1101 PM PST Tue Feb 11 2025

A High Surf Warning is in effect from 3 PM Thursday through 3 AM
Saturday for all Pacific Coast beaches. Westerly swell with a period
up to 15 seconds will build through Friday. As a result, west-facing
beaches will see dangerously large breaking waves of 20 to 30 feet
and up to 45 feet peak waves, non-west facing beaches will see
dangerously large breaking waves of 15 to 20 feet and up to 30 feet
peak waves. Everyone should remain out of the water due to life-
threatening surf conditions. Stay off of jetties, piers, and other
waterside infrastructure, keep pets on a leash and away from the
water, and never turn your back on the ocean!
