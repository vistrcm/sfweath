.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 1140 PM PST Sat Dec 9 2023

Quiet weather this week with mild days and cool nights. A pattern
change takes hold for next weekend into early next week with a
likely return to wet and unsettled conditions.

&&

.SHORT TERM...
(Sunday and Sunday night)
Issued at 1140 PM PST Sat Dec 9 2023

High pressure centered to our south will bring dry conditions, light
offshore flow, and pleasant daytime temperatures. After a chilly
start this morning look for afternoon highs to reach the lower to
mid 60s, with some lower 70s within the warmest inland portions of
the Central Coast. Some high level cloudiness will prevail as a weak
upper trough approaches from the north late in the forecast period.
Another cool night is anticipated with lows generally in the upper
30s/lower 40s inland with 40s along the coast and around the bays. A
few of the typically colder inland spots could dip into the mid 30s
for a brief time towards Monday morning.&&

.LONG TERM...
(Monday through next Friday)
Issued at 1140 PM PST Sat Dec 9 2023

The upper ridge flattens in response to the aforementioned shortwave
arriving from the north on Monday. Dry and fairly quiet conditions
prevail through late week with low pressure dropping through the
Great Basin resulting in periods of generally light offshore flow.
Temperatures will remain seasonal with mild days and chilly
overnights.

Deterministic models and their ensembles still advertise an active
and unsettled pattern evolving for next weekend into early next
week. Some of the model solutions have been rather provocative with
a robust basin-spanning Pacific jet and decent subtropical moisture
tap in play. That said there`s still plenty of details to resolve
this far out. It does appear that rain chances will enter the
picture by this weekend and/or early next week, but specifics on
timing and amounts are elusive at this juncture. Stay tuned for
updates.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 330 AM PST Sun Dec 10 2023

VMC continues for most terminals, with the exception of STS, where
clear skies and light winds will bring periods of mist and IMC
through sunrise. Model guidance is suggesting a more robust return
of fog early Mon morning, and the TAF hints at this possibility with
5SM BR. As confidence grows, the visibility forecast will likely
decrease on subsequent TAFs.

Vicinity of SFO... VMC through the TAF period. Expect light and
variable winds in the morning before a gentle NW sea breeze
develops in the afternoon.

SFO Bridge Approach... Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals... Moderate SE drainage flow at SNS will
continue through mid-day before shifting to a gentle onshore wind
in the afternoon. A similar diurnal wind shift will happen at
MRY, but winds will remain gentle all day. Otherwise the
terminals will remain VMC through the day.

&&

.MARINE...
(Today through Friday)
Issued at 330 AM PST Sun Dec 10 2023

High pressure to our south will bring quiet weather to the local
waters today. Small chance for a shower or two tonight into
Tuesday in the outer waters as a weak weather disturbance passes
by. Gentle to moderate northerly breezes are anticipated through
the weekend, with the exception of fresh to strong breezes which
develop in the southern waters later today into tonight.

&&

.MTR WATCHES/WARNINGS/ADVISORIES...
CA...Frost Advisory until 10 AM PST this morning for CAZ506-516-518.
