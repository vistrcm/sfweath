...New AVIATION...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 450 AM PDT Fri Jun 30 2023

A Heat Advisory goes into effect for inland areas 11 am today to
11 pm Sunday. High temperatures will reach the 90s to 105 for the
interior valleys, cooler at the coast and immediate bay shoreline.
Gradual cooldown begins early next week with temperatures moderating
to seasonal averages.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 450 AM PDT Fri Jun 30 2023

A strong high pressure system, 590 decameters, is residing over most
of California. Compression of the marine layer and a strong lower level
temperature inversion is evident on recent profiler data and it`s warm
overnight in the Bay Area and north Central Coast hills and mountains
with temperatures hovering in the 70s to lower 80s. This is in sharp
contrast to lower elevations to sea level temperatures where readings
are in the 60s and 50s. Compression of the marine layer is resulting
in fog along the coastline, visibilities reduced to 1/2 to 1/4 mile;
allow extra time and please use extra caution this morning if heading
out on the roadways and highways.

Inland, away from the maritime, modifying cooler ocean temperatures,
today`s highs will soar upwards quite quickly not long after the sun
rises. This is the first significant heat of summer, meaning that there
is an elevated risk of heat-related illnesses, especially given that
the extended period of colder than normal temperatures means that people
and pets have not acclimated to the summer heat. Here are some reminders
on how to avoid heat-related illnesses:

* Stay hydrated and drink plenty of fluids.
* Wear lightweight, light-colored clothing.
* Reduce time spent outdoors or stay in the shade.
* Never leave people or pets unattended in vehicles.

Highs today will be above normal, largest positive departures in
temperatures well inland, but below today`s record highs; historic
data at the long term sites show records dating back to previous
record hot weather 1996 and 1972 for example, Kentfield record
today 106 in 1972 (forecast today 89), Livermore record today 112
in 1972 (forecast today near 100). Btw, no record highs were set
Thursday, June 29, many records from a 1934 heatwave still stand.

A signature of cooler than normal air still remains near the coast,
the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) still in cool phase. For example
San Francisco and Kentfield are still awaiting a (June) monthly high
at or above 70F and at or above 81F respectively, very rare for June
per long term historic data at these stations.

Otherwise the marine layer holds tonight, low stratus and fog are
forecast along the coastline with local influxes of cooler maritime
air continuing. Temperatures in the hills and mountains however will
be warm again with readings ~ mid 70s to lower 80s since the strong
high pressure system will be nearly stationary over California.

.LONG TERM...
(Saturday through Thursday)
Issued at 304 AM PDT Fri Jun 30 2023

It`ll be another warm to hot day Saturday, with above to well above
normal temperatures, hottest well inland completely removed from any
maritime cooling. Recent forecast temperature guidance for Livermore
is indicating slightly hotter temperatures Saturday than currently
forecast, nearing 107 to 108 vs 101 official NWS forecast. May need
to adjust upwards inland area forecast highs in later updates,
however it still looks to stay below record high temperatures at
Livermore; record temps July 1st and 2nd in 1950 are 110 to 112.
Under full summer sun and strong high pressure inland locations
quite often soar in temperatures with little cooling overnight.
Dangerous conditions if not used to it, always a good idea to limit
sun exposure and stay properly hydrated.

There`s just enough progression to the synoptic pattern to nudge
the strong 500 mb high pressure system and ridge axis eastward
during this time, but not a whole lot of eastward motion to the
system. Model forecasts do indicate some cooling returning with
onshore winds next week, however this is mainly at the coast and
bays. There`s a slight decrease in 500 mb heights forecast from
mid to late next week as weak troughing moves in from the west. At
peak insolation in July (and August) there`s almost always
coupling between surface heating and synoptic scale high pressure
system(s) setting up over the west, something we`re seeing a bit
more now replacing the longer duration negative 500 mb height
anomalies. Model forecasts are increasingly jumbled beyond 5 days
out through 10 days, some signs of troughing returning and staying
though will be matched against what usually overall produces a more
anchored high pressure system over the west this time of year, it`s
a low confidence extended forecast.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 451 AM PDT Fri Jun 30 2023

Satellite shows stratus building off the coast but still moving
southerly due to the ACV-SFO pressure gradient of 4.6 mb creating a
strong northerly wind component. As the marine layer remains
compressed, expect VFR conditions to prevail for all terminals north
of Monterey Bay through the TAF period. Monterey Bay terminals are
expected to have a mix of VFR/IFR/LIFR conditions throughout the TAF
period. Generally, expect N/NW winds to transition from
light/moderate to breezy in the afternoon with a return of
light/moderate winds tonight. Models show possible IFR/LIFR
conditions near SF Bay area near midnight tonight but low confidence
to include in TAFs as models showed variability and inconsistency.

Vicinity of SFO...VFR conditions currently with some uncertainty
that VFR will prevail the early morning hours. Satellite shows
that stratus is hovering near the San Bruno gap, which can bring
MVFR/IFR CIGs over the terminal. If stratus develops over the
terminal, expect clearing near 17Z. Otherwise, expect VFR
conditions to prevail through the TAF period with N/NW winds
becoming breezy in the afternoon and returning to light/moderate
tonight.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...Stratus remains socked in with LIFR
conditions of lower visibility and low CIGs. Uncertain when
conditions will improve especially with visibility as observation
shows some bouncing around but expect conditions to improve near 16-
17Z. Stratus is anticipated to build again this evening/tonight but
moderate confidence on ceiling height but expect IFR to LIFR
conditions to return.

.MARINE...
(Today through Tuesday)
Issued at 842 AM PDT Thu Jun 29 2023

Surface high pressure over the eastern Pacific will steadily
strengthen through the weekend and early next week. Gusty
northwesterly winds continuing through early next week, peaking
Friday and Saturday when gale force gusts are possible across the
northern outer waters. These strong winds will continue to create
and maintain steep wind waves, creating hazardous conditions for
small craft. Mixed seas continue with longer period southerly
swell and moderate period northwesterly swell continuing through
the end of the week.

&&

.FIRE WEATHER...
(Today through Tuesday)
Issued at 945 PM PDT Thu Jun 29 2023

Hot and dry conditions inland will will increase fire danger and
ignition probabilities as temperatures reach the 90s for the
first time this summer. Meanwhile, the marine layer will compress
to less than 1000 feet tonight through Sunday resulting in
little to no overnight humidity recovery in the hills. Hot
afternoon temperatures will be followed by mild to warm nights in
the higher terrain. Overall, this heat event will feature light
winds, especially inland with light onshore breezes near the coast
and in the coastal valleys. As a result, ERC values will climb
sharply this weekend, likely above the 90th percentile in the
hills with muted growth for lower elevations that will still see
better humidity recovery each night. Despite the cool down early
next week, more modest humidity recoveries lag behind in the far
interior and in the higher terrain. Any nighttime ignitions in the
hills this weekend will not get typical humidity recover to help
with suppression.

.BEACHES...
Issued at 103 PM PDT Thu Jun 29 2023

With the upcoming heat event for the weekend before Independence
Day, a lot of people are expected to seek relief at the beaches.
There are two main risks to beachgoers. The first risk is that
water temperatures remain cold, with buoys reporting sea surface
temperatures in the low to mid 50s, and unprepared beachgoers may
suffer cold weather shock. As a side note, travelers to mountain
streams should be aware that due to continuing snowmelt, the
streams are colder than usual, increasing the risk of cold weather
shock. The second risk for beachgoers is the threat for rip
currents. Rip currents can occur at any beach with breaking waves,
and carry people out to sea faster than even the strongest
swimmers can swim.

Never turn your back to the ocean! It is safest to swim at a beach
with lifeguards. If you are caught in a rip current, don`t try to
swim against it. Instead, swim out of the current, parallel to the
shore, and then back to shore. If you can`t swim, float or tread
water, and yell or wave for help if you need assistance.
