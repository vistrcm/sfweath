.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 158 AM PST Mon Nov 6 2023

A pair of cold fronts will move through the Bay Area today. Light
showers will continue with a slight chance of thunder. Clearing and
higher winds are expected Tuesday. These clear skies will bring cold
morning temperatures Wed-Thu before rain chances return Friday. The
weekend looks dry for now.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 158 AM PST Mon Nov 6 2023

A mature gale force low pressure system in the Pacific has a minimum
central pressure of 994 mb. It is currently located about 300 mi
west of Oregon, and slowly drifting east towards the coast.
A cold front associated with this feature extends south across the
North Bay and into the East Pacific. This front is currently
producing scattered showers as it progresses through the Bay Area. A
reinforcing front is analyzed 200-300 miles west of the first front.
This will soon become the dominant feature and bring another round
of showers through Monday.

The dynamics support some stronger convection after the sun comes
up. A 140 kt jet max will provide upper level divergence above
some moderate low-level instability. We`ve enhanced the
probability of thunder a touch over model guidance to ensure the
forecast includes wording for a slight chance of thunderstorms
extending from the North Bay to the Peninsula and East Bay.
Regardless if any thunderstorms develop, showery precipitation
will continue through the day before tapering off into early
Tuesday morning.

.LONG TERM...
(Tuesday through Sunday)
Issued at 158 AM PST Mon Nov 6 2023

After the second cold front passes, the rain will subside Monday
night. Skies will begin to clear while northerly winds increases to
a moderate to fresh breeze along the coast by Tuesday afternoon.

After the wind impacts subside Tuesday night, our attention turns to
cold temperatures Wednesday through Thursday. Clear skies and light
winds will lead to enhanced radiational cooling at night in addition
to the new polar air mass behind the cold front. The NAM currently
brings the 540 dm 1000-500 mb thickness line as far south as the
Golden Gate on Tuesday afternoon before increasing into the 550s Wed-
Thu. Low temperatures are expected to drop into the 30s for colder
inland areas, and 40s closer to the coast on Wednesday and
Thursday morning. Some areas could approach the freezing mark.
Clear skies will help the day-time temperatures quickly rebound,
but highs should remain a few degrees below normal.

Cloud cover will increase Friday, with some light rain possible.
By Saturday, the jet stream flow will become meridional, with the
Bay Area likely under an amplified ridge axis. If the timing holds,
this will keep the weekend dry. Clearing skies will also allow
temperatures to return to their seasonal normals.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 406 AM PST Mon Nov 6 2023

Current surface analysis showing a pair of cold fronts moving
through this morning, with the stronger, main front moving through
the North Bay as of this issuance. Most terminals will see a mix of
VFR/MVFR this morning, transitioning to MVFR/IFR north to south
through the morning hours as the front moves through, accompanied by
SHRA. Brief window this morning for TSRA around KSTS and the North
Bay coastal areas, though confidence is on the lower end. Winds
largely out of the south across the region ahead of the main front,
shifting to more W/NW as the front passes through. Behind the cold
front, expecting skies to clear with widely scattered post-frontal
showers this afternoon, mainly north of the Golden Gate. FG
potential increases for North Bay terminals overnight into Tuesday
morning as skies clear and excess lower level moisture remains.

Vicinity of SFO...MVFR CIGs and SHRA expected this morning as the
cold front makes its way through by about sunrise. Light S winds
ahead of and during frontal passage through the morning hours,
veering W/SW and breezy post-frontal this afternoon. Clouds scour
out this afternoon behind the front with low confidence in isolated
post-frontal showers during the early evening hours.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...MVFR/IFR CIGs through the morning as
showers exit to the SE. Confidence in timing and coverage of rain
this morning is on the lower end due to the front becoming more
diffuse by the time it makes it south of the Bay Area. For now, kept
coverage at vicinity while raising CIG height to account for any
precip. Will need to monitor as CIG height may be lower in the
absence of precip. Otherwise, skies begin to clear through the
afternoon and evening.

.MARINE...
(Today through Saturday)
Issued at 406 AM PST Mon Nov 6 2023

Low pressure system continues to approach central California this
morning with the main cold front moving through by late morning.
Shower activity will increase with this frontal passage this
morning, and diminish into the afternoon when showers become much
more widely scattered over the waters. There is a slight chance
for thunderstorms this morning over the waters generally north of
the Golden Gate. Moderate period northwest swell continues into
the first half of this week. Breezy to gusty post-frontal
conditions develop midweek next week, especially over the southern
waters.
