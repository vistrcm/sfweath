.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 1242 AM PST Mon Dec 25 2023

Dry and seasonal conditions for Christmas. Winds becoming breezier
on Tuesday in front of a series of storms set to impact the region
starting on Wednesday into the new year.

&&

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 1242 AM PST Mon Dec 25 2023

As Santa came down to the Bay Area and Central Coast, he found the
skies mostly clear with a smattering of high cloud, especially
across the North Bay and parts of the Monterey Bay region. Some fog
and low stratus had also developed in the southern parts of the
Salinas Valley, and in a call with the North Pole meteorologists, we
both agreed that the stratus and fog would expand into other parts
of the Salinas Valley and the North Bay through the morning, so
Santa better make his rounds quick to make Rudolph`s job a little
easier. Those who are waking up to unwrap presents and celebrate
Christmas this morning are seeing low temperatures ranging from the
mid 30s to lower 40s in the inland valleys, to the mid to upper 40s
in the coastal and Bayshore regions. For those who do not celebrate
Christmas, Mother Nature doesn`t discriminate or play favorites, so
you`re seeing the same conditions.

A Beach Hazards Statement will continue through the day today as
large waves impact the coastline. More information is available in
the Beaches section below. Expect a generally dry day associated
with an upper level ridge, with high clouds spilling over from low
pressure systems over the Pacific. Winds will be light, and
temperatures seasonal, with highs in the upper 50s to mid 60s in the
lower elevations, and into the low to mid 50s in the higher
elevations. Tuesday morning`s lows will be somewhat warmer inland,
with most of the interior valleys seeing lows in the low to mid 40s,
perhaps down into the mid 30s in the higher elevations and parts of
southern Monterey County. Along the coasts, lows will be in the mid
to upper 40s.

.LONG TERM...
(Tuesday through Sunday)
Issued at 1242 AM PST Mon Dec 25 2023

The influence of the upper level ridge continues through Tuesday
with high temperatures about the same as today. An approaching storm
system, marking a change in our weather pattern, will mean that
winds will become breezier as the day goes along. On Wednesday, the
rain from this system is expected to impact our region. Most of the
impacts are focused towards northern California and southern Oregon,
but the North Bay will still see anywhere from 0.5-1.5" of rain from
this system, and up to 2" in the coastal ranges. Rain totals remain
relatively light for the rest of the Bay Area and Central Coast,
with the coastal regions seeing around 0.3-0.5" of rain, while
interior portions will see up to 0.3" of rain. Another system comes
through later on Thursday through Friday, with rain totals up to 2-
3" possible in the coastal ranges, and widespread rain totals
possibly up to 0.5-1". High temperatures in the lower elevations
remain from the upper 50s to mid 60s through the last week of the
year.

The active pattern is expected to continue into the New Year, with
CPC guidance suggesting that it`s more likely than not that
precipitation totals will fall above the seasonal average into the
first week of 2024. Remembering that long range guidance does not
indicate how much rain will fall, where rain will fall, or how
intense the rain will be, the best advice for this time of year is
to make sure gutters and storm drains are clear, and to follow
forecast updates from a trusted source.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 259 AM PST Mon Dec 25 2023

VFR through the TAF Period for all but the North Bay, which will see
reduced visibility this morning and again late tonight from mist and
fog. Winds stay mostly light to moderate, peaking in the afternoon,
but most areas look to stay below 10 knots. Winds become light again
into the late night.


Vicinity of SFO...VFR with passing high clouds. Winds look to remain
light through the TAF period.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO

Monterey Bay Terminals...VFR through the TAF Period. Winds look to
stay light at MRY but SNS will have southeast drainage winds that
turn westerly this afternoon and into the late evening before
becoming light again.

.MARINE...
(Today through Saturday)
Issued at 259 AM PST Mon Dec 25 2023

  A new long period northwest swell is building and creating
hazardous conditions for small craft. Strong winds return midweek
with widespread gales possible with an approaching cold front that
will also bring chances for rain. Another cold frontal system
arrives with rain late week.

&&

.BEACHES...
Issued at 300 AM PST Mon Dec 25 2023

A Beach Hazards Statement is in effect from 1 am PST to 7 pm PST.
Expect hazardous wave conditions with breaking waves 10 to 12
feet and localized beach erosion. Large waves can sweep across the
beach without warning, pulling people into the sea from rocks,
jetties and beaches. The larger swings of the tidal cycle will
contribute to the beach risks.
