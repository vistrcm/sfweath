.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 335 AM PDT Mon Mar 10 2025

An active pattern will begin to ramp up late Tuesday night after a
quiet start to the work week. The first of two relatively weak
Atmospheric River storm systems will bring periods of heavy rain
Wednesday into early Thursday with a slight chance of thunderstorms,
gusty winds, high surf and chances of snow for some elevated areas
above 2500-3000ft. Multiple rounds of rainfall continue Friday
through next weekend.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 335 AM PDT Mon Mar 10 2025

A slow moving upper level low moving east toward SoCal will result
in a weak fetch of offshore east/southeast flow today and tonight.
Temperatures will increase slightly from Sundays highs under
filtered sunshine as mid/high level cloud cover gradually increases
throughout the day and evening. Overnight lows into Tuesday morning
will be slightly higher with cloud cover helping to inhibit
radiational cooling. Tuesday will be a mix of sun and clouds along
the coast with more filtered sunshine inland. Steady H50 height
falls Tuesday afternoon out ahead of a deepening trough will keep
temperatures similar to today.

.LONG TERM...
(Tuesday through Sunday)
Issued at 335 AM PDT Mon Mar 10 2025

By late Tuesday night into the early morning hours on Wednesday,
we`ll see prefrontal light rain/drizzle develop mainly along the
coast out ahead of the strengthening upper low. Strong southerly
winds parallel to the coast line will begin to develop Wednesday
morning in the warm sector out ahead of the deepening trough. The
strongest winds will approach 50mph along the Big Sur Coast late
Wednesday morning into early afternoon. The heaviest rainfall
will be just out ahead and along the surface cold front that will
reach the North Bay first by late morning Wednesday. The cold
front will move steadily east and south across the remainder of
our area through the afternoon and evening hours. The coastal
ranges will see the highest rainfall totals, however portions of
the Bay Area, East Bay and South Bay will see periods of moderate
to heavy rainfall Wednesday afternoon with a strong divergent H50
wind field (speeds up to 80mph) over the surface cold front as it
moves inland. The colder midlevel temperatures (-3C to -4C at H85)
associated with the center of the trough approaching our coastal
waters and shoreline by late afternoon and early evening will help
increase low level lapse rates with MUCAPE values between 100-300
J/kg in the post frontal environment. Small hail is possible with
the strongest storms that develop along with gusty winds up to
30-40mph at higher elevations inland. The colder air and upslope
flow along the Santa Cruz and Central Coast coastal ranges will
bring the highest rainfall totals to those areas after sunset
Wednesday, with accumulating snow over the highest ridge lines of
the Big Sur/Santa Lucia coastal range approaching 5 inches by
early Thursday morning.

Another round of rainfall arrives early Friday morning as weak
shortwave energy embedded within broad northwest upper level flow
pushes another weak surface cold front extending from southern
Oregon/NorCal through our area by early Saturday morning. By early
Sunday morning, the next deepening trough becomes more organized and
reestablishes the AR fetch of moisture. The details for the weekend
trough out into the beginning of next week are still too far out to
have much confidence, but multiple rounds of impactful rainfall seem
likely across the North Bay, Bay Area and East Bay at the very
least. It`s nice to see these rain chances continue through the
extended forecast as we shift from weak La Nina condition into ENSO-
neutral over the next couple of months.
