.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 100 AM PST Wed Jan 31 2024

Key Messages:
* Strong weather system brings wind and rain impacts
* Greatest impacts this afternoon and evening
* Flooding of roads, streams, and poorly draining areas
* Flood Watch remains in effect through Thursday
* Downed trees possible due to strong, gusty winds
* Greatest wind damage concern along coast and in high elevations
* Wind Advisories and High Wind Warnings in effect today

Impressive view on this morning`s satellite imagery of a powerful
and expansive low pressure system over the northeast Pacific.
Surface analysis revealed a 962 mb low and occluding front wrapping
around its northeast periphery, with a cold front extending
southwest towards the Big Island in Hawaii. A focused ribbon of
warm/moist advection as evident via the total precipitable water
(TPW) product extending from near Hawaii towards NorCal, with TPW
values of 1-1.25" located just offshore at present. This "tail" of
the low pressure system will be responsible for bringing
considerable wind and rain impacts to the region today and tonight.
Radar is in precipitation mode early this morning with light rain
showers ongoing over the Pacific waters and North Bay within an
elevated warm advection regime.

The morning hours today will primarily feature light to moderate
rain showers over the local waters and Bay Area along with
increasingly breezy southerly winds as elevated warm advection
remains the primary forcing mechanism for ascent. This will begin
"priming the pump" for potentially more impactful conditions which
arrive during the afternoon and overnight hours.

By afternoon the parent low pressure system will occlude over the
northeast Pacific as its associated surface cold front approaches
the NorCal coast. This will focus the "tail" of the system and its
focused plume of wind and moisture squarely on our area during this
time. Model wind fields are quite rambunctious with the southerly
low-level jet cranking up to around 50-60 knots right along coastal
portions of the Bay Area and Central Coast. This really increases
our concern for high winds and wind damage along the coast and
within the higher terrain and High Wind Warnings were expanded to
include the entire coastline in addition to most higher elevation
areas across the region. Gusts to 45 mph are expected in the lower
elevations, with gusts exceeding 60 mph at the ridgetops. Prepare
for the likelihood of downed trees and power outages later today and
tonight, especially within the higher elevations.

Periods of moderate to heavy rain will also develop during the
afternoon as convective showers increase in coverage ahead of the
cold front. Sufficient instability aloft suggests the possibility
for an isolated thunderstorm or two as well. The strong southerly
winds will also enhance orographic ascent along the coastal ranges
leading to locally higher rain totals there. As mentioned in the
previous discussion, forecast rain amounts have slightly decreased
given the progressive nature of the system as it moves through the
region. That said amounts are nothing to sneeze at with 3-5" in the
coastal ranges (with isolated higher amounts), and 1-2" in the lower
elevations. Given the already soggy nature of area soils this is
well enough to result in nuisance flooding issues on roadways and
streams, along with shallow landslides, and rises on mainstem rivers
(with a few potentially breaching flood stage). Steadier coverage of
showers should persist into the evening hours with coverage
gradually waning by morning. Winds will ease during the early
morning hours as well.

For those commuting please use caution later today and tonight and
be aware of potential roadway hazards including standing water,
flooding, and downed trees. Keep in mind that these hazards may be
difficult, if not impossible, to see after nightfall. Stay safe!

.LONG TERM...
(Thursday through Tuesday)
Issued at 100 AM PST Wed Jan 31 2024

An unsettled pattern will persist with scattered showers and perhaps
an isolated thunderstorm on Thursday. Rain amounts through Saturday
appear to be rather light for most areas and shouldn`t cause much
additional trouble.

A stronger system arrives on Sunday and Sunday night with deeper
moisture and a potentially strong low-level jet. This system may
bring additional wind and water impacts to the region. Stay tuned
for updates as details become a bit clearer.

Light showers look to persist into early next week.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 411 AM PST Wed Jan 31 2024

Strong winds aloft are building ahead of the next front. These winds
will cause widespread LLWS as the front moves into the area.
Southerly surface winds and scattered showers increase ahead of the
front with strong gusts expected through much of the day. Winds will
peak within the main rain band. Expect reductions in visibility as
moderate to heavy rainfall passes through the area along with MVFR
CIGs. The front exits in the late night, with light winds and
scattered shower activity expected for the remainder of the TAF
period.

Vicinity of SFO...Showery activity lasts through the morning with
winds increasing ahead of the stronger rain band. Afternoon winds
look to peak around 22 kts with 40 kt gusts. Winds aloft increase as
well leading to LLWS concerns through much of the day. Rainfall will
reduce visibility and offer MVFR CIGs into the evening. Winds become
light after the main rain band exits, with scattered showers
remaining.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO

Monterey Bay Terminals...Strong winds aloft are already causing LLWS
around the Monterey Bay. These winds along with the surface winds
increase through the morning as the front approaches. Expect strong
surface gusts through the afternoon and into the evening with rain
reducing visibility and MVFR CIGs filling over the terminals.
Showers linger behind the main rain band, but winds and CIGs
dissipate into the late night.

&&

.MARINE...
(Today through Monday)
Issued at 411 AM PST Wed Jan 31 2024

A powerful front will approach the marine zones this morning and
spread across the area through the day and into the night
Southerly winds ahead and along the front will reach storm force
across the waters and gale force across the bays. Rainfall will
reduce visibility as the main rain band passes. Seas will build
through the day, becoming very rough by Thursday morning. Winds
reduce into the late night, but scattered showers continue and
seas will remain rough through Saturday in a NW swell.
