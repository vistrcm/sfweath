.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 101 AM PDT Wed Mar 19 2025

Skies remain generally clear tonight with some high cloud intrusion
possible across the North Bay. These clear skies combine with light
winds to create the chance for chilly temperatures and patchy fog in
the interior valleys. A Frost Advisory is in effect from 2 AM to 9
AM this morning in the interior North Bay, the southern Salinas
Valley, the Santa Lucias, and the mountains of San Benito and
interior Monterey Counties, where temperatures will drop to the low
to mid 30s this morning. Unlike yesterday morning, when temperatures
across the interior Central Coast remained much warmer than the
Frost Advisory criteria due to lingering cloud cover and winds,
there is higher confidence in the lows tonight due to the clear
skies and light winds enhancing the radiational cooling that did not
occur last night. Elsewhere, low temperatures reach the middle 30s
to the lower 40s inland and the lower to middle 40s at the coast.

Today will see a dichotomy of weather trends across the forecast
region. The Central Coast and South Bay will see a slight increase
in temperatures from yesterday, with highs in the Salinas Valley
reaching the middle to upper 60s. Across the North Bay, temperatures
will dip a couple of degrees, with the valleys reaching the upper
50s, but more importantly, the fringes of a cold front that will
hammer the Pacific Northwest will bring light rain in the afternoon
and evening hours, with rain totals around 0.05-0.2" in the valleys
and up to 0.4" in the higher elevations. The Bay Area will also see
a few sprinkles, but nothing above a tenth of an inch, while the
Central Coast will see the cloud cover but not get any rainfall from
the incoming system.

.LONG TERM...
(Thursday through Tuesday)
Issued at 101 AM PDT Wed Mar 19 2025

The rest of the week features chilly mornings and a gradual warming
trend during the daytime. Thursday and Friday will feature low
temperatures in the upper 30s to low 40s in the inland valleys and
the middle 40s to near 50 in the coastal regions, and highs in the
middle 60s to the lower 70s in the inland valleys and the middle 50s
to the lower 60s in the coastal regions. The upper level pattern
remains generally zonal, with a couple of storm systems diverted far
to the north of the region and rain chances minuscule and limited to
the northern fringes of Sonoma County.

This weekend into the early part of next week, an upper level ridge
begins to develop across the western United States, contributing to
a much more significant rise in temperatures. The early part of next
week will features highs reaching the lower to middle 80s across the
inland valleys, with the coastal regions reaching the upper 60s to
lower 70s. For context, these temperatures are around 5 to 15
degrees above seasonal averages for this time of year. The current
forecast highs are contributing to minor HeatRisk across the region,
with potential heat-related illnesses limited to people extremely
sensitive to heat, especially when outdoors without effective
cooling or hydration. No heat products have been issued, nor are any
anticipated to be issued, but it is notable that we are beginning to
see these summer-like temperatures return.

Global ensemble model means hint at the possible return of unsettled
weather towards the latter part of next week, but any details of
precipitation amounts, intensities, or durations will have to wait
for the model ensembles to reach something resembling a better
alignment. CPC outlooks for the last week of March suggest a lean
towards precipitation totals above seasonal averages, and towards
temperatures above seasonal averages.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 428 AM PDT Wed Mar 19 2025

Mainly VFR to start the TAF period with high clouds streaming in
ahead of the next front. KSTS did have dense fog form earlier in
the night with LIFR/VLIFR conditions. Current TAF for KSTS will
keep some dense fog through mid morning, but will watch closely.
As high clouds stream in effective cooling maybe limited, which
will impact fog. SW flow increases with some lower cigs developing by
this afternoon with front approaching. Close to or shortly after
00Z rain will spread NW to SE across all terminals. Clearing
behind the front will be dirty with low cigs lingering also NW to
SE across all terminals. Overall conf is moderate.

Vicinity of SFO...Light winds with high clouds through the AM rush
and most of the PM rush.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO. Delayed rain by about 1 hr
from prev TAF and closer to 0100-0130Z.

Monterey Bay Terminals...VFR through roughly 06Z before rain
showers move in.

Issued at 816 AM PDT Wed Mar 19 2025

ultimately move through the coastal waters by Wednesday evening.
Behind the cold front northwest winds will develop with moderate
