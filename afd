...New AVIATION, MARINE...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 145 AM PDT Mon Aug 26 2024

A high pressure system moves in from the west resulting in dry
conditions and a warming trend early to mid week then a slight
cooling trend develops late in the week.

&&

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 227 AM PDT Mon Aug 26 2024

With a 500 mb ridge of high pressure approaching from the west
expect dry and warmer/hotter temperatures today along with a 3-4
mb ACV-SFO pressure gradient and light northerly wind today and
tonight. Daytime highs today 70s and 80s coastside and bayside,
90s inland. Inland daytime highs today will be about 5 to 10
degrees above late August normal highs. There`s minimal moderate
HeatRisk for the interior today. Approx 592 decameter heights with
the 500 mb ridge moves in quickly today, which can boost high
temps quickly, however global/mesoscale forecast model 925 mb and
850 mb level temp trends still look stable for today. The lower
level temperature inversion when present under 500 mb high pressure
systems commonly connects to daytime surface heating (solar angle
and heat input varying with seasons).

For tonight expect radiational cooling allowing temperatures to
cool back to the 50s to around 60F lower elevations while it`ll
remain milder in the 60s to mid 70s in the hills and mountains
within the lower level temperature inversion.

.LONG TERM...
(Tuesday through Sunday)
Issued at 227 AM PDT Mon Aug 26 2024

Moderate HeatRisk coverage expands a little and peaks over our
interior cwa Tue-Wed, however during this time embedded light
onshore wind develops. Like last night, it looks borderline at the
current time and thinking of holding off on issuing a heat advisory
rather messaging HeatRisk maps and high temps for now, with the door
open for later shifts if possibly needing an advisory for mid-week.

During the mid-week there still remains some uncertainty as to
whether the 500 mb ridge will weaken, while it is worth noting
the lower level temperature inversion does remain fairly well
intact even Wednesday. At the 500 mb level the ridge becomes SE-NW
oriented with the ridge axis east of our cwa thus potentially
easing compressional warming a little bit and there`ll be a weak
and dry 500 mb low off the CA coast (residual positive vorticity
left behind from the weekend low now well to our east), Additionally,
as mentioned last night approx 1000 miles upstream a merging of
residual polar jet stream winds and subtropical jet stream winds
will eventually move forward bringing another dry trough to our
area Saturday. The larger scale pattern is progressive (eastward
moving) and model forecasts are showing a slight cooling trend
here later this week and weekend, with near normal highs, but
there`s still some uncertainty as to timing, etc. Otherwise dry
weather conditions continuing this week.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 451 AM PDT Mon Aug 26 2024

VFR across the board with the exception of...you guessed it, Half
Moon bay. This small patch of IFR stratus along the San Mateo
coast is expanding south, but unlikely to affect any TAF sites
this morning. Overall, it looks like another great day for
aviation weather with only a few high clouds and relatively light
onshore winds. There is a decent change for more widespread marine
layer stratus to finally return Tuesday morning, but the models
have been too aggressive lately, so the confidence isn`t very
high. If ceilings do form, they may go IFR as high pressure builds
and compresses the newly reestablished marine layer.

Vicinity of SFO...Currently VFR light onshore winds. High
confidence in VFR through the afternoon. A moderate onshore breeze
will pick up in the afternoon, but not as strong as yesterday.
Stratus will likely arrive in the bay early Tuesday morning, with
a cloud base around 1,000 ft.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...Currently VFR at both MRY and SNS.
There is a chance MRY gets hit with the small patch of stratus
north of the Monterey Bay later this morning, but with a 9 degree
dew point depression at MRY, it will have a hard time surviving.
More likely both terminals will stay VFR through the afternoon. By
early Tuesday morning, there is a 60% chance of morning stratus
at MRY and about 40% at SNS as the marine layer makes a come back
under high pressure.

.MARINE...
(Today through Saturday)
Issued at 451 AM PDT Mon Aug 26 2024

The gradient between subtropical high pressure over the Eastern
Pacific and lower pressure over California will support a gentle
to moderate NW breeze over the inner waters and bays and a
moderate to fresh breeze over the outer waters. A building NW
swell will cause rough seas to build by Tuesday over the outer
waters.

&&

.MTR WATCHES/WARNINGS/ADVISORIES...
CA...None.
PZ...Small Craft Advisory from 9 PM this evening to 9 PM PDT Tuesday
     for Pt Arena to Pt Reyes 10-60 NM.
