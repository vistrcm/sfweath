...New UPDATE...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 121 AM PDT Thu Apr 4 2024

Thursday and Friday will feature unsettled conditions with isolated
to widely scattered rain showers, high elevation snow showers, and
possible thunderstorms. Temperatures then remain cool through the
weekend with warmer and drier conditions returning next week.

&&

.UPDATE...
Issued at 919 AM PDT Thu Apr 4 2024

A low pressure system is currently spinning off the NorCal coast
this morning. This feature is easily seen on satellite imagery as
the large swirl of clouds. Attached to the low pressure is a
front. This front is draped to the south and is currently
sweeping through the Bay Area and Monterey Bay region. The passing
front is really packing a punch with brief heavy rain, small
hail, gusty winds, and even some lightning strikes. The front is
expected to continue its eastward push through the day. Behind
the front precip will taper from steady to scattered.
Additionally, the post frontal airmass will become more unstable
with daytime heating and cold advection aloft. Therefore, the
threat for thunderstorms will increase through the day. Speaking
of colder air aloft, snow levels will also lower through the day.
Area profilers are already showing snow levels dropping below
3,000 feet. High elevation webcams confirm it with some flakes
showing up.

No update needed this morning, but will be watching radar closely
through out the day. If you are traveling on area roadways today
just be mindful of rapidly changing conditions due to weather.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 121 AM PDT Thu Apr 4 2024

Light returns on radar (KMUX) are being picked up offshore, but will
increase in coverage and intensity throughout the morning as a cold
upper level systems approaches the region. Meanwhile, radars to the
east (Sacramento) and north (Eureka) are showing returns across
their regions with isolated thunderstorms across Handford`s and
Sacramento`s regions. The core of a mid/upper level low just off of
the OR/CA coast will move across the Bay Area this afternoon and
will trigger isolated to widely scattered showers and thunderstorms
(25-35% probability). Snow levels (2000-2500 ft) will also plummet
tonight as cold air advection settles across the region.
Additionally, temperatures Thursday afternoon will struggle to warm
much above the mid 50s in major population centers to upper 30s
across the higher terrain.

As mentioned above, thunderstorms will have a 25-35% chance of
developing as the colder air mass settles into the region. Steep
lapse rates aloft, surface CAPE, negative LIs, and little CINH all
point to thunderstorms. Thus, SPC has much of the region in a
general mention of thunder for Thursday and Friday. Given lowering
freezing levels, any thunderstorms that to develop will have the
potential to produce copious amounts of small hail.

&&

.LONG TERM...
(Friday through Wednesday)
Issued at 121 AM PDT Thu Apr 4 2024

The mid/upper level low will shift inland Thursday night, but a
secondary disturbance will bring another round of rain showers, high
elevation snow showers, possible thunderstorms, and colder
temperatures to the region on Friday. Storm total liquid
precipitation from Thursday morning through Friday night: 0.25-0.75"
for most areas, up to 1.25" in the Santa Cruz Mountains, and up to
1.75" in the Santa Lucia Range. As far as snowfall goes: a few
inches are possible in the highest peaks of the North Bay, up to 3"
in the highest peaks of the Santa Cruz Mountains, up to 5" in the
Diablo Range, and 6-12" in the peaks of the Santa Lucia Range. Much
will depend on the exact track of the shower activity!

From previous forecaster: It`s worth noting that the combination
of clouds, precip, and below normal temperatures (day and night)
will have an impact on the vulnerable population or those without
adequate shelter.

Precip tapers off late Friday into Saturday, but the colder
temperatures remain. There`s still a passing system over the
weekend, but latest guidance has backed off on potential.
Forecast has trended drier.

Warmer and drier weather fully returns early next week.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 507 AM PDT Thu Apr 4 2024

An anomalously cold and deep upper level trough for early April is
arriving from the northwest this morning. A secondary surface cold
front moving eastward across the forecast area this morning will
result in showers, gusty west winds both surface and aloft and a
lowering freezing level. Scattered convection during the 12z TAF
cycle may include lightning and small hail. Showers /VFR-MVFR/
today, tonight and Friday morning, winds likely easing by mid to
late evening and overnight.

Vicinity of SFO...VFR-MVFR. A band of showers along a cold front
will rapidly approach from the west this morning, resulting in a
wind shift to a gusty west wind approx 15z. Scattered showers and
a gusty west wind continuing for much of the remainder of the day.
Later today to this evening the 700 mb-500 mb trough approaches
from the northwest which may produce an isolated thunderstorm or
two. With the lowering freezing level, showers and/or thunderstorm(s)
may contain small hail.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...VFR-MVFR. A band of showers along a cold
front will rapidly approach from the west this morning. Gusty west
winds today with additional showers developing. With the lowering
freezing level, showers and/or thunderstorm(s) may contain small
hail.

.MARINE...
(Today through Tuesday)
Issued at 437 AM PDT Thu Apr 4 2024

A winter-like pattern for early April with a cold air mass and
deep upper level trough will quickly move in behind a secondary
cold front this morning resulting in a mix of gusty winds, rough
seas hazardous for small craft, heavy showers and a slight chance
to chance of thunderstorms with small hail today to Friday. A
weaker upper level trough arrives from the northwest possibly with
a passing shower Sunday. An upper level high pressure ridge builds
in from the west beginning Monday.
