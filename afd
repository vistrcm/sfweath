.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 301 AM PDT Sun Aug 4 2024

In the land of the Bays, low marine clouds reign supreme during
the morningtime. A marine layer experiencing weak vertical
expansion forms drizzle droplets that moisten surfaces along the
coast. A lingering effect of a noble battle between the ongoing
ridge across the West and a weak trough of monsoonal moisture from
the depths of the Gulf of California. "Victory" was shouted by
the ridge, but it wasn`t without a fight. As the ridge works to
regain its great strength, temperatures across the land of the
Bays respond by increasing ever so slightly on this day.

.LONG TERM...
(Monday through Saturday)
Issued at 301 AM PDT Sun Aug 4 2024

The great ridge fights another day (or two), sending temperatures
even higher by Tuesday, and showing little mercy for the
spectators who live amongst the Bay`s many inland valleys.
However, the great ridge never has the chance to gain enough
strength to even think about battling the mighty marine layer.
Lucky for those spectators living along the water`s edge. The
reign of this great ridge doesn`t last long, though. A change of
times is on the horizon as a new contender enters the fabled land
of central and northern California. Behold, a trough! A welcome
sight to all spectators, arriving with subtle winds that bring
gifts of moisture and cooler temperatures. The spectators will be
elated, as these temperatures will be about what they would
normally expect for this time of year. The welcome visitor will
have a stay into the weekend, keeping these "normal temperatures"
around for its entire tenure.
