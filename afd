brings substantial rain and strong wind Wednesday night through
Friday morning.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 1208 AM PST Mon Feb 10 2025

The 00Z weather balloon measured the precipitable water at 0.2".
That`s in the bottom 2% of the climatology database. The low-
level (lowest 150 mb) RH was 30%, while the mid-level (150-350 mb
above the surface) RH was 2%. This very dry air mass is keeping
the skies totally clear tonight. Surface dew-points are generally
in the mid to low 30s. With mostly calm to light winds,
radiational cooling has been very efficient tonight. As stations
start to reach the dewpoint, the rate of cooling may slow, but we
are still on track for cold temperatures on par with yesterday.
Once the sun comes up, it will turn into another great day with
plenty of sunshine and mild afternoon temperatures. We will likely
start to see some high clouds by the end of the day. These clouds
are signaling the increasing moisture associated with the
changing weather pattern. Beyond a nice sunset, these clouds will
help limit radiational cooling overnight and keep Tuesday morning
a couple degrees warmer than the previous few days.

.LONG TERM...
(Tuesday through Sunday)
Issued at 1208 AM PST Mon Feb 10 2025

Tuesday will be a transition day from a stable dry pattern to
unsettled wet weather later in the week. After another cold
start, cloud cover will gradually increase through the second half
of the day. Rain chances return Tuesday night. This is the first
of 2 separate systems that move through this week. A relatively
weak low pressure system will form along a boundary just offshore
the Bay Area. This first round of rain is really not an
atmospheric river. The moisture tap is too localized and the
synoptic wind is not strong enough or from the right direction to
qualify. However, this precursor event will bring around 1/2" to
1" to most of the area, with more in the Santa Cruz and Santa
Lucia mountains. Since it`s arriving in the morning and the air
mass is still cold, there will likely be some high elevation snow
with this system. The best chance for accumulation is around Mt.
Hamilton, but all peaks above 2500 ft could get a few flakes
before the temperature starts to increase in the late morning. It
looks more and more likely that there will be a distinct break in
the rain at some point Wednesday. At this point some of you will
think we over-hyped this system. I just ask that you save that
critique for another day as the real show arrives early Thursday
morning.

The second push of moisture is definitely an atmospheric river. A
much stronger low pressure system will move slowly towards the
coast of far N. California, extending a long cold front back
towards Hawaii. Ahead of this front, persistent SW flow will pump
warm tropical moisture to the coast. The heaviest rain currently
looks to arrive Thursday morning before and during fropa. Rain
chances will persist into Friday, but with colder air aloft, the
mode will switch from steady stratiform to convective showers.
There is even a slight chance for thunderstorms Thursday night -
Friday morning. All told, we are expecting significant rain totals
this week. Nearly all areas are expected to get at least 2", with
up to 8" in the Santa Cruz and Santa Lucia mountains. This will
surely cause urban and small stream flooding. We are also
monitoring saturated soil levels and anticipate some shallow
landslides. Large river flooding isn`t explicitly forecast at this
point, but the probability has been trending up. The exact N-S
distribution of rainfall will depend on where the cold front sets
up during the peak of the event Thursday. Wind is also a concern
with this system. Low elevation wind gusts from the SW are
expected to reach 30 mph Thursday, and around 25 mph from the W on
Friday. Winds will be nearly twice as strong in the mountains.
Saturday looks dry, but there is some guidance that brings light
rain back on Sunday. Since the forecast is complex, let me
summarize the week with a personal note. I coach the local high
school track team, and we are planning to run through any rain
Wednesday and Friday, but will certainly cancel practice on
Thursday.
