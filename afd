.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 252 AM PDT Tue Sep 5 2023

Quiet weather this week with morning coastal clouds and afternoon
sun. Temps continue a gradual warming trend into the coming
weekend.

&&

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 315 AM PDT Wed Sep 6 2023

Marine layer remains compressed with a slight degree of deepening
this morning per the Fort Ord vertical profiler. Not seeing any
current indication of dense fog as of writing, though will
continue to monitor through the morning for patchy dense fog along
coastal areas. Otherwise today is looking to shape up a lot like
yesterday with clear skies and comfortable to warm afternoon temps.
Persistent trough off the West Coast bringing ample onshore flow
keeping afternoon temps at or slightly below seasonal normals.

.LONG TERM...
(Thursday through Tuesday)
Issued at 315 AM PDT Wed Sep 6 2023

Persistent upper level trough begins to lift as high pressure
currently over TX/NM/Northern MX begins to move westward into the
weekend. Temps warm very gradually into the weekend with highs in
the mid-90s inland by Sunday/Monday. This late weekend/early next
week timeframe looks to be the peak of the warm up with Heat Risk
remaining mostly minor with isolated pockets of moderate. Temps
cool back towards seasonal normals mid-next week.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 356 AM PDT Wed Sep 6 2023

Compared to this same time yesterday, the marine layer appears to
have deepened somewhat, leading to slightly higher ceilings
throughout the region. A smattering of MVFR to IFR and LIFR
conditions are being reported throughout the region at this hour,
with IFR/LIFR conditions as a result of fog and low ceilings.
Though, terminals around the SF bay continue to report VFR
conditions at this time, with just FEW-SCT clouds. However, am
expecting that these terminals become MVFR briefly between 12-16Z as
stratus develops in the morning hours.

Beyond 18Z, expecting all terminals throughout the area to clear to
VFR and lasting well into the nighttime hours of Wednesday into
Thursday for most. Onshore winds around 10-15 knots expected into
the late afternoon, weakening to become light around 6-8 knots into
the late night of Wednesday.

Vicinity of SFO... VFR conditions expected to become MVFR soon, and
lasting through at least 16Z, afterwhich clearing to VFR is
expected, and lasting through the TAF period. Winds westerly around
13-16 knots expected into the late afternoon, weakening thereafter
into the night. Stratus and MVFR/IFR ceilings not expected to return
at this time until just beyond the TAF period in the mid morning
hours of Thursday near 14Z.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...MVFR conditions are expected to become IFR,
and lasting through 16Z. Beyond then, a return to MVFR is
expected briefly as fog and low ceilings begin to lift and mix
out, with all ceilings dissipating towards the late morning to
become VFR. VFR conditions last until the late afternoon, with
stratus returning on the earlier side near 02-03Z. Winds westerly,
10-12 knots into the afternoon.

.MARINE...
(Tonight through next Sunday)

throughout the forecast period. Several swell trains will
propagate through the waters over the next several days with long
period southerly swell and moderate period northwesterly swell.
