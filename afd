...New UPDATE, MARINE...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 244 AM PDT Thu Oct 31 2024

Rain showers continue across the Bay Area and Central Coast
through mid to late this morning. Conditions will generally dry
out by the afternoon/evening hours. Rain will return again Friday
into Saturday.

&&

.UPDATE...
Issued at 948 AM PDT Thu Oct 31 2024

The cold front has moved into southern Monterey and San Benito
Counties and should move completely out of our region within the
next few hours. Rainfall totals were generally modest, with
rainfall totals up to a tenth of an inch in the interior East Bay,
South Bay, and Monterey Bay regions, from a tenth to a quarter of
an inch in the North Bay valleys, the northern part of the East
Bayshore region, and the Santa Lucias, and a quarter to a half an
inch in the North Bay mountains and the Santa Cruz Mountains. The
"winner" in terms of rainfall totals is the Middle Peak (Mount
Tam) RAWS, where favorable topography and multiple developing
showers last night contributed to a rainfall total of 1.30 inches.

For the rest of the day, conditions remain generally dry with some
lingering showers possible in northern Sonoma County, although
with additional rain totals in the few hundredths of an inch. The
forecast for Trick or Treaters calls for a dry but chilly evening
with temperatures from the mid 50s to the mid 60s in the lower
elevations at 6 PM.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 244 AM PDT Thu Oct 31 2024

On this day of ghosts and ghouls, we offer you not a trick, but, a
treat with the report that light rain showers are actively making
their way through the Bay Area. More widespread showers have already
moved out of the North Bay with most sites having seen between 0.15"
to 0.25" of rain. A few notable exceptions to this are located in
Marin County where training showers have resulted in locally greater
totals of 0.3" plus. These will likely be the highest totals from
this event with precipitation accumulations set to decrease as the
front moves southward and falls apart. Totals will stay well below
0.1" across the rest of the Bay Area and Central Coast but portions
of the coastal Santa Cruz Mountains may see totals around to
slightly above 0.1". Showers will continue to move through the Bay
Area through the early morning before gradually tapering off between
4AM to 6AM as the front exits the region. Across the Central Coast,
scattered showers will continue until mid to late morning. By 7AM to
8AM, the front will have largely moved out of the Central Coast with
rain chances dwindling by late morning. Given that roads may still
be damp during the morning commute, use extra caution while driving
and slow down. Gusty onshore winds remain possible within valleys
and gaps/passes at the time of frontal passage and during the day on
Thursday.

After frontal passage, high resolution guidance is indicating
scattered showers may be possible across the North Bay but any
accumulating precipitation will only amount to a few hundredths of
an inch. To the pleasure of anyone partaking in the time honored
tradition of trick or treating, guidance has been trending drier
everywhere Thursday evening just in time for festivities to begin.
Mornings will continue to be chilly with most locations in the mid
to upper 40s while the North Bay valleys and interior Monterey/San
Benito counties dip into the 30s to low 40s. Afternoon highs will
remain about 5 to 10 degrees below average with most inland sites in
the mid 60s and most coastal sites in the upper 50s to low 60s. By
6PM, high temperatures will have dropped into the mid to upper 50s
across the region and will continue to cool into the low 50s to
upper 40s by 8PM to 9PM. If you find yourself saying "trick or
treat" to your local meteorologist, you just may receive the treat
of widespread rain showers returning Friday into Saturday in lieu of
candy.

.LONG TERM...
(Friday through Wednesday)
Issued at 244 AM PDT Thu Oct 31 2024

As discussed over the past few days, the upper level trough that is
bringing us our Halloween rain will deepen and extend farther
southward Friday into Saturday. This will allow for a more moist air
mass to extend into the Bay Area, bringing us our next round of
showers late Friday morning into early Saturday afternoon.
Accumulations will be higher with this event compared to our early
and midweek systems. This will result in more widespread
accumulations of up to half an inch of rain across the Bay Area and
Central Coast. Across the North Bay and within the coastal mountain
ranges (Santa Cruz, Santa Lucias) totals will be locally higher with
the potential for up to an inch of rain. Additionally, this system
will lead to increased instability across the region and contribute
to a slight (generally less than 15%) chance of thunderstorms.
Thunderstorm development will become more likely by late Friday
afternoon across the North Bay and chances gradually increase moving
southwards Friday night into Saturday. Both rain shower and
thunderstorm chances will decrease by late Saturday evening.

While chilly mornings look to continue through the forecast period,
we continue to see a pattern shift from below average to slightly
above average temperatures beginning Sunday. Guidance continues to
indicate that upper level troughing will continue to deepen as it
moves to the south and east of us into the Four Corners region with
the potential for a cut off low to develop. This is a classic set up
for gusty offshore wind development throughout the Bay Area and
elevated fire weather concerns. At the same time, ridging will start
to build over the West Coast, bringing with it a warmer and much
drier air mass. This will lead to a quick decrease of daytime
relative humidity values and a more gradual decrease of overnight
relative humidity values. While the previously discussed rain
systems will help slightly decrease fire concerns, totals will not be
high enough to be considered a fire season ending event. Residents
of the Bay Area and Central Coast should take precautions to prevent
the start and spread of wildfires next week as fire season reminds
us it isn`t over yet.
