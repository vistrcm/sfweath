...New SHORT TERM, LONG TERM, AVIATION...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 154 PM PDT Tue Apr 16 2024

Warm, dry, and quiet this week as high pressure dominates. Onshore
flow and increased cloudiness late week as a weak trough moves
in.

&&

.SHORT TERM...
(Wednesday and Wednesday Night)
Issued at 1125 PM PDT Tue Apr 16 2024

High pressure at the surface and aloft will prevail across the
northeast Pacific. This will be the primary short-term influencer on
the weather regime across the Bay Area and Central Coast.
Temperatures early this morning are already fairly mild in the
thermal belts with readings in the 60s. And with plenty of sunshine
expect temperatures to climb rather quickly for most areas today.
Afternoon highs will generally reach the mid 70s to lower 80s for
most areas. The exception will be along the coastal interface and
within the marine-influenced valleys where a light onshore breeze
will keep temperatures in the mid 60s to around 70. There are some
vestiges of a very shallow marine layer along the coast so can`t
rule out some AM stratus or fog, but if it were to develop it should
mix out rather quickly after sunrise.

.LONG TERM...
(Thursday through next Tuesday)
Issued at 1125 PM PDT Tue Apr 16 2024

After peaking on Wednesday the upper ridge will gradually lose
influence through late week in response to a weak perturbation
translating through the mean westerly flow. This wave will be
moisture-starved, so we`re not looking for any meaningful
precipitation, however we do expect more stratus, stronger
onshore flow, and cooler temperatures for Friday into the weekend.
It`s possible we could wring out a little orographically
influenced coastal drizzle, but confidence isn`t high enough to
include this in the forecast just yet.

Temperatures will cool a few degrees on Thursday, with a more
notable cooling (especially along the coast) by Friday.

The ridge rebuilds a bit over the weekend with a slight warming
trend. However onshore winds will keep things cooler by the coast.
Dry conditions should prevail.

.AVIATION...
(06Z TAFS)
Issued at 1125 PM PDT Tue Apr 16 2024

While  most areas stay VFR, but with pockets of fog will build in
the North Bay and Monterey Bay into early Wednesday. Expect light
winds through the late morning followed by moderate to breezy winds
into the afternoon as widespread VFR returns.

Vicinity of SFO...VFR through the TAF period. Winds stay light into
the afternoon before moderate westerly winds return. these winds
linger into the night before becoming light and variable.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO

Monterey Bay Terminals...VFR through the early morning, then times
of passing fog before the mid morning. Expect light winds into the
late morning before moderate westerly winds build for Wednesday
afternoon. These winds become light again into Wednesday night.

.MARINE...
Issued at 910 PM PDT Tue Apr 16 2024

Ridging continues to dominate, bringing fair weather through much
of the week. Strong and gusty northwest winds are expected
through much of the week, with gale-force gusts expected over the
far northern waters through late tonight. Moderate period
northwest swell continues to move through the waters this week,
though shortens in period to around 8-10 seconds near Wednesday.
Light, longer period (18 seconds) southerly swell will also be
present through the week.
