.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 157 AM PST Tue Dec 3 2024

Above normal temperatures and dry conditions will continue to
prevail through the week.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 157 AM PST Tue Dec 3 2024

GOES-West Nighttime Microphysics tells us all we need to know, let`s
take a look from north to south. A weak low pressure system situated
over the North Bay is bringing mid-level clouds to Northern
California, stratus can be seen developing along the Big Sur Coast
and spreading northward, and a mid-level cloud shield associated
with a weak low pressure system off the California/Mexico border is
extending into the Desert Southwest. Aside from that, generally
clear skies and calm conditions are being observed across the
region. Because of this, patchy dense fog will likely develop in
favorable coastal and valley locations with some already being
observed on the ALERTCalifornia cameras in the Russian River Valley.
While Watsonville Airport is not yet a climate site due to it being
too young (less than 30 years old), it did break a record for daily
maximum temperature on December 2nd by reaching 72 degrees, breaking
the previous record of 70 degrees set in 2006. The warming trend
continues with Oakland Museum forecast to reach 68 degrees today
which would break the previous daily maximum temperature record of
67 degrees set in 2014.

.LONG TERM...
(Wednesday through Monday)
Issued at 157 AM PST Tue Dec 3 2024

A Rex Block pattern will develop as a ridge of high pressure
continues to build across the West Coast and low pressure develops
over the Desert Southwest allowing for above normal temperatures and
dry conditions to prevail. The first of a pair of shortwaves set to
skirt the region will bring increasing cloud cover and a slight
chance of precipitation to the northern outer waters on Thursday.
The second shortwave on Saturday is expected to be stronger,
bringing the warming trend to a halt with slight chances of
precipitation extending across the outer waters and moderate
northerly breezes developing. To no avail, it is likely that a
ridge of high pressure will develop again in the wake.

VFR is expected to prevail through the forecast period with the
exception of KSTS which is seeing occasional drops into LIFR with
fog in the area, which is expected to lift within a couple hours

When diurnal winds increase slightly after sunrise, expect weak
offshore flow this morning, eventually becoming weak onshore flow
