...New UPDATE, MARINE...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 306 AM PDT Mon Jun 16 2025

Pleasant weather continues into the new work week. Temperatures will
be near normal today, slightly above normal Tuesday and Wednesday,
then back to normal or slightly below normal for the end of the week
into the weekend.

&&

.UPDATE...
Issued at 901 AM PDT Mon Jun 16 2025

No changes to the forecast at this time. We`re watching the
stratus this morning and it seems to be receding fairly well in
the North Bay and interior valleys. There is a some small pin
wheeling going on in the Monterey Bay region where as the flow
around San Francisco and San Mateo counties looks to be a little
stronger. Expect clearing to occur by late morning or early
afternoon for interior locations, with stratus doing its best to
hold along the coast.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 306 AM PDT Mon Jun 16 2025

Temperatures today will be near seasonal averages with sunny skies
inland and mostly a mix of sun and marine layer stratus along the
coast, especially the San Mateo coastline. The marine layer is pre
sent, however dry boundary layer air (PWATS ~ 25th percentile or
lower) will continue to hold off more widespread low level stratus
that is generally present during `June Gloom`. A weak trough axis
will push across our area this afternoon and evening resulting in
moderate onshore flow and gusty winds from late this morning through
later this evening across the Bay Area and higher elevations inland.
Despite the increased onshore flow the drier air aloft will help
keep widespread low marine stratus from developing again tonight.

&&

.LONG TERM...
(Tuesday through Sunday)
Issued at 306 AM PDT Mon Jun 16 2025

Relatively weak shortwave ridging will lift temperatures Tuesday and
Wednesday slightly above normal, with a passing shortwave trough
bringing temperatures back to or slightly below normal for the end
of the week into next weekend. Continuing the theme of PWATs well
below normal through most of the extended, it will be difficult to
identify exactly where the most impactful marine layer clouds will
develop on a day to day basis.
