...New UPDATE...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 1138 PM PDT Sun Sep 3 2023

Quiet weather this week with morning coastal clouds and afternoon
sun. Temperatures will start out below normal with a gradual
warming trend for late week into the weekend.

&&

.UPDATE...
Issued at 527 AM PDT Mon Sep 4 2023

A Dense Fog Advisory was issued for Monterey Bay and the Monterey
Peninsula until 9 AM. Travel carefully and expect rapid
visibility changes in these areas this morning. No other changes
to the forecast.

&&

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and Tonight)
Issued at 1138 PM PDT Sun Sep 3 2023

Upper troughing will persist with a weak impulse crossing through
NorCal. No sensible weather impacts from this disturbance are
expected, just a continuation of onshore flow and cool temperatures.
Low stratus clouds will blanket much of the region this morning with
a gradual clearing towards the coast by around noon. Thereafter look
for plenty of sun over most of the region. High temperatures should
range from the mid 60s to mid 70s for the coastal and bayside areas
with 70s to mid 80s for the typically warmer inland spots. Low
stratus returns tonight with lows dropping off into the 50s.

&&

.LONG TERM...
(Tuesday through next Sunday)
Issued at 1138 PM PDT Sun Sep 3 2023

The upper trough remains prominent through mid-week before
geopotential heights rise and the upper flow becomes more
southwesterly around building high pressure across the Desert
Southwest. This will bring a gradual warming trend through the
weekend. Nothing overly notable in the heat department, but the
typically warmest inland areas should reach the upper 80s to mid
90s. Otherwise quiet is the rule this week with no meaningful
weather on the horizon.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 519 AM PDT Mon Sep 4 2023

Nighttime satellite imagery this morning shows stratus across the SF
Bay and stretching down the Santa Clara valley. At this time, a
smattering of ceilings exist, from VFR at KSJC and KSNS, to MVFR at
KLVK, IFR at KSFO and KOAK, to LIFR at KSTS, KAPC, and KMRY. All in
all, quite a range of visibilities and ceilings throughout the
region that models don`t seem to be replicating well at this time.
Nonetheless, expecting lifting of ceilings and mixing out of stratus
towards the later morning to become VFR and lasting through at least
the early evening. Uncertainty exists once again as to timing of
stratus return tonight with a shortwave disturbance moving through
the region towards the evening. Though, current thinking is an early
evening return of stratus to MVFR conditions for Monterey Bay, and
early Tuesday morning for terminals northward of Monterey. Into the
mid morning hours of Tuesday, some hints towards ceilings becoming
IFR for most terminals exist, though best confidence is in MVFR
conditions at this time.

Vicinity of SFO...IFR/MVFR expected to clear to VFR towards the
later morning. Winds to become gusty around 25 knots with sustained
speeds around 17 knots and onshore into the afternoon at KSFO, then
weakening into the night.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...Current LIFR conditions at KMRY are
expected to improve to IFR/MVFR towards sunrise as fog and stratus
begin to mix out. Clearing to VFR expected towards the late morning
to early afternoon. Timing of stratus return is uncertain, though
current thinking is that MVFR conditions return into the early
evening. Winds westerly around 10-12 knots this afternoon.

.MARINE...
(Today through Saturday)
Issued at 519 AM PDT Mon Sep 4 2023

Fresh to strong northwest winds will develop again into the
afternoon and evening today along favored coastal jet regions,
stronger than what was observed today. With the return of breezy
to gusty northwest winds, steeper wind waves are expected through
midweek which may pose hazardous conditions for small craft. Many
swell trains are moving through the coastal waters, including a
long period northwesterly swell and a moderate period southerly
swell. A new, long period southerly swell arrives Monday.
