.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 1229 AM PDT Sun Oct 22 2023

A mature low pressure system in the East Pacific is supporting a
cold front currently located about 100 mi off the coast of the
Bay Area. A few scattered showers in the morning will precede
frontal passage. As the front passes this afternoon, there is an
increasing chance for thunderstorms, particularly in the North
Bay. While showers will be intermittent, overcast skies will
likely remain all day. Clearing and dry Monday and Tuesday, with
moderate NW winds.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 1229 AM PDT Sun Oct 22 2023

The radar is picking up on the first band of very light rain
along the coast from Sonoma to Santa Cruz counties. This may not
even be reaching the ground at the moment, but is at least
helping to prime the lower atmosphere for more rain to come
through the day. Short term, high resolution guidance continues
to suggest some thunderstorm potential in the North Bay. There is
also a chance in the East Bay, particularly in Solano County and
eastern Contra Costa County. If these storms do develop, the most
likely timing would be in the afternoon. The HREF mean shows
boundary layer CAPE values of 150-200, with about a 10% chance of
exceeding 500. Farther south, it still looks like multiple bands
of light rain through the day.

For thunderstorms to develop, the surface temperature will need
to exceed expectations, while the humidity remains high. This
scenario could play out if the mid-day sun makes a surprise
appearance after some morning rain. Another option is if warm
sector southerly winds raise the lower level temperature. In
fact, we are already seeing signs of this, with the temperature
and dew point at Pt. Reyes increasing by 6-7 degrees since 9PM
Saturday. Either one of these scenarios would keep the temperature
and dew point elevated before the cold mid-upper level air moves
in and decreases stability later in the day. The final piece of
the puzzle is a lifting mechanism to release the energy, and the
afternoon frontal passage will provide that.

Besides the rain, the skies have become overcast tonight and will
remain so through the day. High temperatures will likely remain
in the 60s for most, with some valleys reaching the low 70s. Winds
will shift from southerly ahead of the front, to northwesterly behind
the front.

.LONG TERM...
(Monday through Saturday)
Issued at 1229 AM PDT Sun Oct 22 2023

Monday will bring clearing skies and moderate NW winds. The
morning temperature will remain suppressed behind the cold front,
but more incoming solar radiation should help afternoon
temperatures rebound to near normal. With the cooler morning
temperature and recent rain, the thermodynamic ingredients are all
in place for morning fog on Monday, but the high winds may help
keep the boundary layer too well mixed. Pretty standard weather
expected Tuesday through Thursday with no precip and a reforming
marine layer bringing periods of low stratus to the usual places.
There will be a gradual cool-down through the week as another
deep-layer trough passes Wed-Thu.

There`s a slight chance of rain later in the week, but the
uncertainty is quite high at the moment. While the probability and
timing are anyone`s guess, the models do agree that any
accumulation will be light, and focused in the North Bay.

Looking way ahead, nearly 1/2 of GEFS members are hinting at over
an inch of rain sometime in the days following Halloween.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 439 AM PDT Sun Oct 22 2023

Low clouds /IFR-MVFR/ and light rain are quickly developing ahead
of a low pressure system approaching northern California. A slight
chance of thunderstorms across the North Bay later in the afternoon
and early evening. Thunderstorms not mentioned yet in the North Bay
TAFs, will monitor radar and satellite and amend if needed.

Vicinity of SFO...MVFR, light rain today. Southeast wind 5 to 10 knots
until cool frontal passage mid to late this afternoon. Southwest to
west wind this evening, veering to light northwesterly in the evening.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO

Monterey Bay Terminals...MVFR ceilings, light rain developing this
morning. Ceilings MVFR-VFR later today, MVFR tonight with post cool
frontal showers.

.MARINE...
(Today through Friday)
Issued at 434 AM PDT Sun Oct 22 2023

A low pressure system over the Eastern Pacific will result in
light rain over the coastal waters and bays today. Beginning
tonight into Monday winds will shift to the northwest with the
strongest winds over the northern waters early to mid week,
creating hazards for  small craft in the coastal waters. Moderate
period northwest swell continues to diminish through early week.
