Area Forecast Discussion...UPDATED
National Weather Service San Francisco CA

...New UPDATE...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 152 AM PST Sat Mar 1 2025

Wet weather returns today and continues into next work week.
While rain chances are forecast nearly each day, there will be
periods of dry conditions. Overall, rain amounts are NOT
anticipated to result in widespread or significant impacts,
however, wet commutes and cooler conditions are probable.

&&

.UPDATE...
Issued at 827 AM PST Sat Mar 1 2025

The inherited short term forecast is in good shape with just a
few tweaks needed.

Marine fog and stratus continues to seep into the area, largely
across the coastal and valley areas. The 12Z RAOB from Oakland
indicates a stout inversion in place with the lowest 3,000 feet of
the atmosphere remaining largely "capped." This will translate to
a gradual clearing of skies for areas currently inundated with
cloud cover and sky grids have been updated to account for this
slower clearing.

Otherwise, our attention will turn to tonight into Sunday as we
kick off our unsettled weather pattern, forecast to continue into
next week. Short term high-resolution model guidance continues to
trickle in this morning suggesting a couple of rounds of rain on
Sunday. The first round of precip early Sunday morning will
feature a band, albeit quasi-linear in nature, to move eastward
along a frontal boundary. It`s possible that not all locations
experience measurable rainfall and as such PoPs ranging between
20% and 60% appear reasonable during the morning hours. The
highest concentration of rain activity in the morning is
anticipated across the Eastern Santa Clara Hills, Santa Cruz
Mountains, and Santa Lucia Range. For the afternoon, the forecast
will advertise post-frontal showers and isolated thunderstorms,
especially across the South Bay and Central Coast. The main
hazards, outside of lightning, are expected to be brief bouts of
small hail. We`ll nail down more specifics with the afternoon
forecast update.

Otherwise, the remainder of the forecast remains unchanged and
updated products have been transmitted.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 152 AM PST Sat Mar 1 2025

Low coastal clouds have been moving inland with pockets of fog
forming around the bays and filtering into the interior valleys of
Sonoma Co. This has plateaued overnight cooling for these areas, but
will limit warming for the first part of Saturday morning before the
fog dissipates.

The warm sector ahead of the next front builds into the day,
offering some pre-frontal drizzle before the cold front build in for
the evening. The current forecast doesn`t show much in the way of
separation from the rains associated with the cold front and the
rain moving in behind as the parent low of the front rolls into the
area.

&&

.LONG TERM...
(Sunday through Friday)
Issued at 152 AM PST Sat Mar 1 2025

The low moving into the post frontal environment will keep rain
chances persistent through the weekend and into Monday. Thunderstorm
chances increases as the low moves through the area, peaking at 15%
near the Monterey Bay and along the Big Sur Coast on Sunday.
Rainfall totals from the Saturday through Monday rain event look to
range between 0.10" to 0.50" with higher elevations in the Santa
Cruz Mtns and in the Santa Lucias getting closer to 0.75"

Dry weather returns Monday evening, but is short-lived as another
rain-maker arrives mid Tuesday. Model trends have been in good
agreement in timing and overall progression of the cold front
associated with this mid-week rain. However, there still seems to a
fair amount of variability between models on how the low pressure
builds in behind the cold front. In some models, there is even some
doubt of how well the low maintains its structure as it moves
inland, really limiting the spread of rainfall and how long this
rain system lasts for our portion of the region.

As of the current forecast, the low pressure moves inland long the
Big Sur Coast, offering the higher rain amounts in the Santa Lucias
(1"-1.5") before the low exits on Thursday. Looking through the last
few forecast updates there has been mild bouncing back and forth in
rainfall totals, but chances for widespread wetting rains remain
solid.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 341 AM PST Sat Mar 1 2025

Currently a mixed bag of LIFR-VFR with fog/stratus quickly filling
in. All terminals (with the exception of LVK which is forecast to
remain VFR) are expected to have a late clearing this
morning/afternoon if they clear at all. For those that do clear,
expect MVFR ceilings to roll in with the light rain tonight. Rain
showers will linger through the day tomorrow with a slight chance
for thunderstorms.

Vicinity of SFO...Currently VFR with westerly flow with stratus
quickly closing in on the terminal. High confidence in IFR
conditions persisting through the morning. Light rain will impact
the terminal tonight with rain showers lingering tomorrow.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...Currently LIFR and calm at MRY and IFR with
westerly flow at SNS. SNS is expected to deteriorate further to LIFR
with both terminals remaining sub-VFR though the TAF period. Light
rain will will impact the terminals tonight with rain showers
lingering tomorrow.

&&

.MARINE...
(Today through Thursday)
Issued at 341 AM PST Sat Mar 1 2025

A fresh northwesterly breeze will prevail today with light rain
beginning this afternoon, continuing into tonight. Sunday and
Monday will bring a strong northwesterly breeze, rain showers,
and a slight chance for thunderstorms. Significant wave heights
will be rough to very rough through Monday. A moderate
northwesterly breeze, moderate seas, and moderate rainfall is
expected Tuesday and Wednesday.

&&

.BEACHES...
Issued at 341 AM PST Sat Mar 1 2025

Hazardous beach and marine conditions are expected through Monday
due to building long period westerly swell supporting breaking
waves of 14-19 feet. This will be both a beachgoer and a mariner
threat. Everyone should remain out of the water due to life-
threatening surf conditions. Stay off of jetties, piers, and other
waterside infrastructure, keep pets on a leash and away from the
water, and never turn your back on the ocean!
