...New AVIATION...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 1243 AM PDT Sun May 21 2023

Another cloudy start for Sunday but with better afternoon clearing.
Warmer temperatures will persist inland into Monday, with a
slight cooldown expected in the mid-week. Coastal regions stay
cooler with a deep marine layer.

&&

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 1243 AM PDT Sun May 21 2023

Building stratus will cover much o the region this morning,
leading to plateauing temperatures. Lows will mostly stick to the
mid to low 50s. The changing upper-level pattern will allow for
much more clearing for Sunday morning than what occurred Saturday.

A clearer late Sunday morning and afternoon means warmer temps for
areas not along the Immediate coast. Highs will range from the 80s
in the more interior valleys, to around 60 for the coast, but most
areas will peak in the upper 60s and lower 70s.

While lows stay similar for Monday morning, the warming trend of
afternoon highs continues. Monday looks to offer the warmest
temperatures of the forecast. Coastal areas will peak in the 60s,
inland areas will lean more toward the mid 70s and low 80s, and the
more interior areas will approach the 90 degree mark.

&&

.LONG TERM...
(Monday through Saturday)
Issued at 1243 AM PDT Sun May 21 2023

After Monday`s heat, a persistent troughing pattern will begin a
cooling trend of steady onshore flow. Highs fall back into the 60s
and 60s for most areas on Tuesday with slight reductions over for
the rest of the work week. Lows will fall into a cooler range as
well with mostly upper 40s and low 50s for the rest of the work week.

Longer term models and ensembles are in fairly good agreement that
the trough pattern lasts well through the work week followed by
another very similar trough placement. This could mean prolonged
onshore flow for the end of May, keeping temperatures on the cooler
side and preventing fire fuels from drying at a quicker pace.

Much can change in the long term with this second trough pattern,
but at the time of writing confidence looks pretty fair.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 454 AM PDT Sun May 21 2023

A mix of MVFR and IFR conditions continue to prevail for most terminals
with the exception of LIFR conditions in the North Bay. The Bodega
Bay profiler shows the marine layer remains deep (~2000 feet).
Therefore, expect low clouds to linger into the early morning hours
and is expected to remain until diurnal heating takes into effect
creating VFR conditions starting in the late morning/early afternoon.
Expect winds to transition from light to breezy as we approach the
afternoon. Moderate confidence that VFR conditions will prevail
through late tonight as some models suggested a mix of MVFR/IFR/LIFR
conditions returning between 03-07Z tonight. Will continue to
monitor if any flight category changes to the TAFs is needed.

Vicinity of SFO...IFR conditions are expect to linger into the
morning with conditions improving in the early morning to MVFR.
Timing of the transition to MVFR was uncertain but models suggest
near 15-17Z. Expect conditions to improve in the afternoon to VFR
with breezy winds and chance of gust up to 23 kts. Chance of MVFR
cigs may return late tonight, but low confidence to include in TAFs
at this moment.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...IFR conditions prevail through the early
morning but expect conditions to improve to MVFR for KMRY and VFR
for KSNS near the late morning. Winds are expected to become
moderate to breezy. High confidence that low clouds will get socked
in over the terminals causing MVFR/IFR conditions late tonight.

&&

.MARINE...
Issued at 901 PM PDT Sat May 20 2023

Northwest winds continue to be breezy over the waters with gale
force gusts likely across the northern outer waters starting
Sunday. Across the inner waters into the bays, winds peak each
afternoon and evening. In addition, wind driven waves will cause
hazardous seas for small craft. A series of southerly swells
continues, with heights around 2 to 3 feet and periods generally
around 14 to 16 seconds until the middle of next week.

&&

.MTR WATCHES/WARNINGS/ADVISORIES...
CA...None.
PZ...Small Craft Advisory until 9 AM PDT this morning for PZZ540-565.

     Gale Warning from 9 AM this morning to 3 AM PDT Monday for
