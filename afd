...New UPDATE...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 204 AM PDT Mon Oct 21 2024

Weak cold front this morning and much better humidities today.
Otherwise quiet through the week. Light rain chances for northern
areas by the end of the week.

.UPDATE...
Issued at 826 AM PDT Mon Oct 21 2024

The forecast remains on track this morning. Inland relative
humidity values are on the mend, with values roughly 15-30
percent higher than they were at this time yesterday and that will
hold through the afternoon hours. Confidence in the extended
forecast remains low, though some rain is expected in the 8-14 day
range, maybe sooner with some light rain possible across the North
Bay and Bay Area late this week.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 204 AM PDT Mon Oct 21 2024

The weak cold front moving through the region is evident on
satellite with ample high clouds present. At the surface, high
temps today a few degrees cooler than yesterday. Otherwise not
much notable change at the surface post-front. The marine layer
will gradually deepen through this morning and largely mix out
behind the front. Though plenty of extra low level moisture
brought in by onshore flow will be present up through 2000 feet,
bringing much awaited vast improvements to relative humidity.

.LONG TERM...
(Tuesday through Sunday)
Issued at 204 AM PDT Mon Oct 21 2024

A little more fun in the long term outlook with plenty more to
talk about. Longwave ridging centered over much of the CONUS is
set up to promote a decent troughing pattern over the EPac late
this week. The good news for us is that guidance has demonstrated
reasonable confidence in the placement of this trough pattern
into this weekend. That means mild temps and a slight chance of
rain. The other news for us (not necessarily bad, just news) is
that nearly all of the jet energy and large scale forcing remains
well to our north, being very early in the Fall/Winter season.
Most locations will see at least some chance of rain in their
forecast, but the best chances for anything measurable late this
week and weekend will most certainly be up in the North Bay. Other
locations may see some coastal drizzle, but confidence is low in
widespread rainfall this weekend. However, reaching just outside
the 7 day forecast window provides some potential active weather
to look at. Ensemble guidance is very confident in a rather active
pattern continuing into the beginning of November. The big
question currently is the location of such features. A large
amount of uncertainty is currently present among members of the
GFS and ECMWF ensembles. The GEFS presents a deep trough in a
position to bring the first widespread rainfall to the region,
while the EPS advertises the same feature inland over the Great
Basin, which would result in a much dryer scenario. The
frustrating bit of this as a forecaster is that each of these
possible and very different solutions presents a nearly equal
likelihood of occurrence according to ensemble cluster analysis.
Realizing this is not necessarily meaningful for forecasting at
this juncture, it is important to recognize the possibility of the
upcoming active pattern and stay tuned to the forecast for
updates as confidence increases.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 409 AM PDT Mon Oct 21 2024

VFR with light breezes. Confidence has decreased in stratus
development away from the immediate coast this morning, as the
frontal passage has disrupted the formation of the marine layer, and
the TAFs have been amended to reflect this. Light to breezy onshore
flow develops this afternoon and evening. Lingering high clouds
expected through the day, with low to moderate confidence in some
inland stratus development tonight through Tuesday morning.

Vicinity of SFO... VFR through the day with breezy onshore flow
developing in the afternoon and evening. Model output hints at some
stratus flowing through the Golden Gate tonight through Tuesday
morning, with the terminal at the edge of the stratus, but
confidence is low to moderate at this point of the night.

SFO Bridge Approach... Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals... VFR through the day. The light offshore
flow this morning should keep stratus at bay, with breezy onshore
flow developing in the afternoon and evening hours. Low to
moderate confidence in the return of IFR-LIFR stratus late this
evening through Tuesday morning.

&&

.MARINE...
(Today through Saturday)
Issued at 409 AM PDT Mon Oct 21 2024

A weak cold front is coming through the region, but only bring
moderate northwesterly winds with some gusty winds in the outer
waters. Overall the return of high pressure will bring favorable
marine conditions through the week.

PZ...Small Craft Advisory from 9 PM this evening to 3 PM PDT Tuesday
     for Pigeon Pt to Pt Pinos 10-60 NM-Pt Arena to Pt Reyes 10-
