Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service San Francisco CA
506 AM PDT Wed Mar 13 2024

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 1248 AM PDT Wed Mar 13 2024

Gusty offshore winds develop for tonight into Friday morning with
Wind Advisories in effect for portions of the Bay Area. Otherwise
dry and warmer conditions prevail for late week through the
weekend.

&&

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 1248 AM PDT Wed Mar 13 2024

An omega blocking pattern will evolve aloft with an upper level
ridge becoming prominent over the northeast Pacific. This will
support surface high pressure building across the Intermountain West
as low-level troughing evolves along the CA coast. An increasingly
robust offshore pressure gradient will ensue, with the SFO-WMC
gradient peaking around minus 11-13 mb towards Thursday morning.
This range is most often associated with weak to moderate offshore
(Diablo) wind events in our area. Expect N-NE winds to increase
tonight with high elevation gusts in the 45-60 mph range. A Wind
Advisory remains in effect for much of the North and East Bay
Mountains beginning tonight, and was expanded to include the Santa
Cruz Mountains and Marin Coastal range as well. The combination
of recent rainfall/wet soils and strong gusty winds may result in
downed trees and some power outages, especially at higher
elevations. Winds in the valleys will become breezy tonight as
well but it looks like the stronger winds may not fully mix into
the lower elevations until Thursday. Besides the winds the
weather should be rather pleasant with mostly sunny skies and high
temperatures in the 60s. Lows tonight will dip into the 40s, with
some upper 30s in the coldest part of San Benito and southern
Monterey Counties.

.LONG TERM...
(Thursday through Tuesday)
Issued at 1248 AM PDT Wed Mar 13 2024

Thursday and Friday:

The offshore wind event will continue for Thursday into Friday
morning with greater potential for stronger gusts to mix down into
the North and East Bay valleys. For this reason the Wind Advisory is
expanded into these areas during this time. While not formally in
the advisory area, the remainder of the Bay Area will also be
breezy, with gusts in the 25-35 mph range. Secure loose outdoor
items and be extra cautious for falling trees or branches given
recently saturated soil and potentially storm-weakened trees.
Temperatures will be on the upswing given high pressure and warm
downsloping winds. Look for highs to reach the 70s inland with
upper 60s along the immediate coast and bays. Lows will be in the
40s with cities around SF Bay holding near 50.

Saturday through Tuesday:

The blocking pattern will remain largely in place as the upper level
high slowly shifts from the northeast Pacific towards the
Intermountain West by early next week. As the surface pressure
gradient weakens winds will relax for the remainder of the extended
period with rather pleasant and seasonally warm conditions
prevailing. Look for highs generally in the 70s with some upper 60s
along the immediate coast. Lows should be in the 40s to around 50.
All-in-all the weather`s looking pretty nice for mid to late March.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 425 AM PDT Wed Mar 13 2024

High confidence VFR through the TAF period with the exception of
KMRY with patchy cigs this AM. NW/N winds will be breezy starting
mid- morning and becoming increasingly gusty through the
afternoon. Offshore winds will pick up noticeably overnight with a
45kt low level jet around 2500 feet expected to develop. For TAF
sites where winds aloft will become decoupled from the surface
tonight such as KSTS and KSJC, LLWS will become a concern
overnight into Thursday morning. For sites such as KAPC, KSFO, and
KOAK, winds are more likely to mix down to the surface overnight-
Thurs morning, where gusts up to 30 knots (locally higher) will be
likely. Winds will temporarily diminish Thurs morning, but gusts
of 20-25 knots will become more widespread by then.

Vicinity of SFO...VFR with light to breezy N/NW winds. NW winds
will increase through the early afternoon hours today to sustained
speeds of 20 knots. By tonight, expect northerly winds to
increase through the overnight hours with gusts up to 34 knots
possible. Winds will continue to shift more northeasterly tonight
into Thursday morning.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...Patchy stratus over KMRY resulting in
intermittent MVFR cigs which will last through 14z. VFR expected
for the rest of today-tonight. Onshore winds will continue
through the day today, becoming moderately strong this afternoon.
Winds diminish overnight and become more northerly.

&&

.MARINE...
(Today through Monday)
Issued at 425 AM PDT Wed Mar 13 2024

Northerly winds will increase through the day today, becoming
strong with gale force gusts by the afternoon. Northwest swell
will continue to diminish through the day, but developing strong
winds will prolong hazardous conditions over the seas. Winds will
shift offshore Thursday morning and start to diminish, allowing
conditions to gradually improve into the weekend.
