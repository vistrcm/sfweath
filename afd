...New UPDATE, MARINE...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 1230 AM PDT Wed Jul 24 2024

Slightly cooler weather today with more cooling through the end of
the week. Heat Advisories are in effect for many inland areas
outside of the North Bay until 11PM tonight.

.UPDATE...
Issued at 930 AM PDT Wed Jul 24 2024

No update to the current forecast. A Heat Advisory remains in
effect until 11 PM tonight, followed by a refreshing cooling trend
that begins tomorrow and will continue through the weekend into
next week.

Weak, elevated convection earlier this morning in vicinity of
southern Monterey County and southern San Benito County has
dissipated. There were no observed lightning strikes and we`re not
expecting any redevelopment at this time.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 1230 AM PDT Wed Jul 24 2024

Temperatures are running about 5 degrees warmer than this time
yesterday, but the forecast continues to improve for the remainder
of the week. Highs today are expected to be in the 90s for most
inland areas, although the North Bay Valleys will probably stay in
the upper 80s, and the Northern Salinas Valley will be in the
upper 70s. Low temperatures will be about 5-10 degrees cooler
tonight, and the Heat Advisories are all set to expire at 11 PM.

The 00Z balloon found quite a bit of mid-level moisture and
measured the precipitable water at 1.44". That`s in the 99th
percentile of historical records. This tropical moisture is
generating some showers, but they are very weak and over the
water. It seams the dry and stable lower levels are producing too
much CIN for any of the mid-level energy to be realized. The
radar trends have been decreasing and it`s looking less likely
that any convective storms will form over land in our area. There
is still a chance through the day, but it`s decreased from 10% to
5%. A paintball plot of the HREF members shows that the 3 km NAM
is the only CAM holding on to reflectivities over 30 dBZ. By
tonight the threat will have passed.

.LONG TERM...
(Thursday through Tuesday)
Issued at 1230 AM PDT Wed Jul 24 2024

The cooling trend begins to pick up steam on Thursday as a
subtropical disturbance moves from the E Pacific towards N
California. As this system approaches the coast and eventually
gets picked up by the jet stream, it will trigger wind shift from
SW to NW, as well as decreasing 1000-500 mb thickness and 850 mb
temps. The cooling continues to accelerate, and Friday will be a
further 10 degrees cooler than Thursday. A weak cold front will
move through, providing even more cooling by Saturday. When all is
said and done, most areas will be about 10 degrees below normal
this weekend. The decreasing 500 mb heights will also allow the
marine layer to expand, bringing morning stratus much further
inland. Looking ahead, more seasonal temperatures are expected
through the middle of next week, but the uncertainty really
balloons by Wednesday the 31st. The following weekend could
either be warmer than the current heat (15% chance), colder than
the upcoming weekend (10% chance), or somewhere in between (75%
chance).

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 448 AM PDT Wed Jul 24 2024

Currently VFR across the board with low to moderate confidence in
LIFR conditions developing at MRY and SNS this morning. The marine
layer is expected to deepen by tomorrow night which will allow
stratus to extend farther inland. Confidence remains low to moderate
in stratus reaching STS, OAK, and SFO overnight with guidance split
as to how far inland stratus will reach. Stratus is not currently
expected to reach APC, LVK, or SJC tomorrow night. Light, variable
winds continue through the morning before moderate onshore flow
returns during the afternoon.

Vicinity of SFO...VFR through the TAF period with some potential for
MVFR-IFR CIGs to develop after 12Z tomorrow. Ensemble guidance is
leaning towards stratus extending into Oakland but not reaching SFO.
Opted for a SCT group in the TAF to indicate some uncertainty given
a few models indicating some lower level clouds in the vicinity of
SFO. Moderate onshore flow will return during the afternoon with
some potential for gustier winds to develop during the
afternoon/evening.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...VFR expected to become IFR-LIFR by mid
morning. Satellite has shown stratus staying just off of the coast
all night and clear skies prevailing over the Central Coast. Calm
winds and clear skies are increasing confidence in patchy fog
development this morning from 12-15Z but confidence remains moderate
overall. Tonight`s stratus return looks to be trending slightly
later tonight than in the 06Z TAFs with arrival expected between 04-
08Z. Moderate onshore flow returns during the afternoon before
weakening overnight.

&&

.MARINE...
(Today through Monday)
Issued at 930 AM PDT Wed Jul 24 2024

Northwesterly breezes will increase to moderate to fresh today as
the ridge axis over the area weakens and the trough to the north
strengthens, borderline strong gusts will be possible through the
forecast period. Significant wave heights will continue to abate
through the forecast period. There`s a 5% chance for thunderstorms
today.

.MTR WATCHES/WARNINGS/ADVISORIES...
CA...Heat Advisory until 11 PM PDT this evening for CAZ510-512>518.

PZ...Small Craft Advisory until 3 AM PDT Friday for Pt Arena to Pt
     Reyes 10-60 NM.
