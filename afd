Updated at 1206 PM PDT Thu Aug 21 2025

 - A Heat Advisory is in effect for much of the Bay Area and
   Central Coast today for areas away from the ocean.

 - Heat advisories continue for many inland areas through
   Saturday.

 - Stay hydrated and avoid strenuous activities during the
   hottest part of the day.

.SHORT TERM...
Issued at 237 AM PDT Fri Aug 22 2025
(Today and tonight)

Current situation: Interesting setup on satellite imagery
overnight showing a marine layer redeveloping along the coast and
locally inland as upper level clouds/moisture stream from the
south and a notable heat signature from the Pickett Fire in Napa
county. More on Pickett Fire in the fire section below. The marine
layer is showing up at roughly 800 ft per profilers and is a
little more pronounced than 24 hours ago. Given the shallow nature
of the marine layer patchy fog will be possible along the coast
with pockets of fog down to a mile or less. It`s also another mild
night above the marine layer with temperatures well into the 70s
above 1500 feet with several low 80s above 2000 feet.

Today and tonight: No major changes to ongoing Heat Advisories
across the Bay Area and Central Coast. It will be another hot one
away from any marine influence with temps in the 90s to lower
100s and HeatRisk in the Moderate to Major (pockets of Extreme).
It`s Friday and you may have afternoon/evening outdoor plans so be
mindful of the heat and take appropriate action. Given the
ongoing fire in Napa county smoke has been added to the forecast
for portions of the North Bay. For tonight - more relief will be
felt over the lower elevations as the marine layer will deepen to
about 1k feet. Expect more stratus coverage by Saturday morning.
Above the marine layer will be mild and dry once again.

The fly in the ointment so to speak is the ongoing non-zero threat
for showers and dry lightning late today and Saturday. 00Z model
suite continues to paint a similar picture from the last few runs.
One cannot deny the monsoonal moisture advection from the south
given latest satellite imagery. Additionally, guidance has been
rather persistent on some upper level instability (MUCAPE/lapse
rates/HLTT). Some of the "hotter" CAMs paint a decent amount of
showers on modeled reflectivity imagery as well. Dry lightning
and high based convection scenarios are rather finicky and you
need all of the ingredients to line up just right. In this case,
they aren`t and that`s why this portion of the forecast remains
low confidence. While we do have some moisture/instability it`s
about where they overlap or don`t. x-sections and pt soundings
continue to show the moisture is rather high up and not
necessarily overlapping with best instability. Moisture remains
in the 500-550mb level. Would like to see moisture lower and at
least closer to 600mb. Previous historic dry lightning events show
moisture much higher in the 600-700mb. Therefore, will continue
to mention the low chc in the AFD and not in the official
forecast.

.LONG TERM...
Issued at 340 AM PDT Fri Aug 22 2025
(Saturday through Thursday)

One final day of real impactful heat with Heat Advisories
remaining for the interior with highs in the 90s to lower 100s.
Much more relief is expected along the coast and locally inland.
The non-zero threat for showers/dry lightning remain for Saturday
as well. Highest likelihood would be for eastern portions of the
forecast area bordering the Central Valley.

The ridge that brought record breaking heat will begin to fade by
Sunday. An upstream upper trough begins to move in by Monday as
the ridge exits eastward. As such a gradual cooldown is expected
through the middle of next week.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 507 AM PDT Fri Aug 22 2025

Stratus is more progressive across the region with a mix of IFR-LIFR
CIGs across much of the region. Skies will clear by mid to late
morning with VFR prevailing through the evening. Current thinking is
that the push of monsoonal moisture this afternoon/evening will help
stratus to arrive earlier tonight than it did this morning. For now
looking at an early return of stratus close to 03Z-06Z at MRY and
SNS with slightly later returns around 09-12Z for Bay Area airports.
Moderate onshore winds are expected during the afternoon/evening
before winds diminish overnight.

Vicinity of SFO...Stratus is filling in over the SF Bay which will
result in patchy stratus coverage reaching SFO. The marine layer is
at a depth of around 800 to 1000 ft which is on the cusp of stratus
being able to reach SFO through the San Bruno Gap. Confidence is
moderate that stratus will remain temporary at SFO through 16Z with
some potential for the current TEMPO to be replaced with a
prevailing stratus through 16Z if the duration continues for a long
enough period. Onshore winds gust to around 25 knots during the
afternoon/evening with winds to diminish overnight.

SFO Bridge Approach...Patchy stratus is filtering into the SF Bay
north of the bridge approach. Guidance shows stratus remaining to
the north of the bridge approach but temporary loss of VAPs may be
possible on approach through 16Z.

Monterey Bay Terminals...LIFR CIGs persist through mid morning with
VFR returning during the afternoon/evening. Some potential remains
for visibilities to at least temporarily drop to 2SM-3SM this
morning with MRY slightly more likely to see decreases in visibility
than SNS. IFR conditions return this evening with the monsoonal push
of moisture helping bring an earlier return around 04-06Z. Moderate
west to northwest winds are expected this afternoon/evening with
winds easing overnight.

.MARINE...
(Today through Wednesday)
Issued at 507 AM PDT Fri Aug 22 2025

Winds gradually diminish Friday into Saturday with fresh to strong
northwesterly gusts becoming moderate to fresh. Seas abate by late
Friday with calmer winds and seas expected this weekend into the
next work week. Locally stronger gusts are anticipated in favored
coastal jet regions near Point Sur and along the Santa Cruz
coastline on Friday with weaker coastal jets likely to develop
over  the weekend.

&&

.FIRE WEATHER...
Issued at 344 AM PDT Fri Aug 22 2025

Pickett Fire in N Napa county. Cams and satellite both indicate
active fire behavior overnight. This makes sense given nearby
weather stations showing temps in the 70s/low 80s and RH values in
the upper teens to 30% ranges. Simply put, mild and dry. Winds
thankfully aren`t overly strong. Occasional gusts to 10 mph are
being observed over the highest peaks.

Elevated fire weather concerns remain and not just because of the
new Pickett Fire. The combo of hot/dry conditions remain both day
and night for today and at a minimum Saturday. Expect another
onshore push of afternoon/evening winds, which will coincide with
peaking heating. We`ll finally see fire weather conditions
improve late in the weekend and early next with the cooldown.
Lastly, as mentioned above we continue to monitor the non-zero
chance for dry lightning and showers. Given the moisture profile
of the atmosphere developed storms/showers will likely be drier in
nature. That would lead to gusty outflows, which could be
problematic if they occur near the Pickett Fire.
