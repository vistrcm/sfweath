.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 206 AM PDT Sun Mar 30 2025

A gale force low over the Eastern Pacific Ocean will continue to
move towards the Pacific Northwest over the next 24 hours. Rain
showers from the associated warm front are just beginning to move
inland with rainfall expected to increase in coverage and intensity
through the mid-morning hours. Southerly winds are also expected to
increase with widespread wind gusts of 20 mph, up to 45 mph along
the immediate coast, in the higher terrain, and through gaps and
passes. Wind and rain shower activity will begin to diminish by late-
morning with isolated to scattered rain showers expected in the
afternoon. The cold front will begin sweeping from northwest to
southeast this evening bringing with it another round of steady
rainfall with totals over the next 24 hours expected to be 0.10"-
1.50" with southwest facing coastal ranges expected to receive the
greatest accumulation.

.LONG TERM...
(Monday through Saturday)
Issued at 206 AM PDT Sun Mar 30 2025

An interesting development has been the addition of a slight (15%)
chance for thunderstorms during the day tomorrow (primarily in the
North Bay). Current thinking is that if skies clear allowing the
surface to sufficiently heat, that in addition to recent cold air
advection will make the atmosphere unstable. A model point sounding
for STS doesn`t reveal anything eye-popping, but a high shear low
cape regime can be expected. Thunderstorms or not, post-frontal rain
showers are expected through the day Monday. If a thunderstorm were
to develop, locally gusty winds and heavy rainfall, lightning, and
small hail would be the primary hazards. The extended forecast has
drastically changed over the last 24 hours with the drier trend
continuing. The parent low will be slow to push through the region,
but as it finally does so on Tuesday, widespread light rain is
expected with totals up to 0.25". After that, the rest of the week
largely looks to remain dry outside of some coastal drizzle from a
coastal trough. The warming trend kicks off on Wednesday with
temperatures expected to be above seasonal averages by the weekend.
As high pressure builds across the West and cloud cover is lost,
expect cold conditions to return overnight in the higher terrain.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 440 AM PDT Sun Mar 30 2025

An approaching warm and cold front will bring a strong southerly
breeze and periods of rain throughout the morning. Conditions will
begin to improve in the afternoon as the winds diminish and
showers become more isolated. VFR-MVFR ceilings will likely remain
for the majority of the TAF period.

Vicinity of SFO...MVFR ceilings are likely to develop through
mid morning as scattered showers continue to push through. The
biggest impact today will likely be from strong southerly winds,
and there is a good chance gusts at SFO reach as high as 35 kts
for a few hours while the fronts move through. The strong winds
will also be shifting from southeasterly to southwesterly through
midday.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...While the showers are lighter and more
isolated, the ceilings will be lower through the majority of the
TAF period. As is typical with down valley southerly winds, SNS
will be quite gusty this morning. Unfortunately the wind sensor
at the airport is not reporting at the moment. MRY, on the other
hand, will be more protected in the lee of Jack`s Peak.

.MARINE...
(Today through Friday)
Issued at 920 AM PDT Sun Mar 30 2025

Gale force gusts will continue to diminish to a moderate breeze
after the fronts move through this afternoon. Expect occasional
showers through the day. Winds will shift back to westerly by
Tuesday. Moderate seas will prevail through Monday before the
combined seas from a southerly swell and NW wind wave become very
rough Tuesday morning.
