 - Warming and drying trend through Saturday with some offshore
   winds in the higher elevations

 - Long period northwesterly swell will bring an increased risk of
   sneaker waves and rip currents to Pacific Coast beaches Friday
   night and into Saturday

 - Slightly cooler conditions next week

.UPDATE...
Issued at 908 AM PDT Fri Oct 17 2025

Conditions are improving across the North Bay Valleys which will
allow the Dense Fog Advisory to be cancelled as of 9AM PDT this
morning. Localized fog is still possible across the North Bay
Valleys (vicinity of Santa Rosa), over the San Pablo/Suisun Bay,
and across southern portions of the Santa Clara Valley (near San
Martin). The Sonoma County and San Martin Airports both continue
to report fog and limited visibility between 1/4SM to 1/2SM.
Commuters should continue to take extra precautions while driving,
leave extra time to reach their destination, and slow down if
they encounter fog. Conditions will continue to improve through
the rest of the morning with fog cover to dissipate as
temperatures warm up.

.SHORT TERM...
Issued at 1249 AM PDT Fri Oct 17 2025
(Today and tonight)

Satellite imagery shows generally clear conditions across the region
with patches of stratus, notably a couple of patches from the
southwestern corner of San Francisco down through the coast of San
Mateo County. There`s a slight chance (around 10-20% probability) of
fog developing in the North Bay through the morning, but it is a low
confidence forecast and offshore flow aloft and at the higher
elevations may disrupt the marine layer. The clear skies should
allow for robust radiational cooling through the nighttime, with
lows dropping into the middle 40s to lower 50s in the lower
elevations, with the higher elevations of the North bay edging into
the middle 50s and parts of the interior Monterey and San Benito
counties seeing lows into the lower 40s or the upper 30s. Any low
clouds that do develop should mix out by the late morning hours. As
a side note, while we would usually associate offshore wind flow
with fire weather threats, the fact that these offshore winds are
relatively light along with the recent rainfall should put a damper
on the risk for the next couple of days.

The weather pattern is dominated by the interaction between a
positively tilted trough, with the parent low pressure system moving
across the Dakotas and extending into and off of southern
California, and a ridge over the central Pacific that extends into
the Pacific Northwest. The interaction results in northerly flow
aloft, helping to reinforce a warming and drying trend across the
region. Through the day, the trough is expected to "split", with one
piece getting dragged to the east into the Desert Southwest while a
cut off low develops off the coast of Baja California. This should
allow the influence of the ridge to strengthen and expand over more
of the West Coast, allowing for warmer temperatures today. Highs
across the region range from the middle to upper 70s across the
inland valleys, to the lower to middle 70s along the Bays and the
middle to upper 60s along the Pacific coast, generally near or
slightly below the seasonal average.

.LONG TERM...
Issued at 1249 AM PDT Fri Oct 17 2025
(Saturday through Thursday)

The warming trend continues through the upcoming weekend, with parts
of the inland valleys reaching the lower to middle 80s, with even
the passing of an upper level trough through British Colombia and
the Pacific Northwest doing little to cause a sensible drop in
temperatures. Offshore flow could develop on Monday and Tuesday, as
the cutoff low meanders closer to southern California and leave
behind slightly cooler temperatures through Thursday.

Next Friday and the following weekend see the return of rain chances
across the region as a deep trough develops in the Gulf of Alaska
and approaches the West Coast. As of the latest update, the CPC has
put out a moderate risk (40-60% probability) of heavy precipitation
across the North Bay from the 24th to the 27th. Ensemble model
clusters show substantial differences in sensible weather outlooks
between differing solutions regarding the strength and timing of the
incoming trough. Any discussion of rainfall totals thus falls into
the head-in-the-clouds fantasy land where any model output should be
considered highly fallible at best. Stay tuned...

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 456 AM PDT Fri Oct 17 2025

.Mainly VFR conditions have prevailed across the Bay Area
and Central Coast, though the North Bay Valleys have been bouncing
between MVFR to LIFR. Expect fog to sock in a bit up there over the
next few hours, with LIFR to IFR conditions expected around and just
after sunrise. Conditions should begin to improve by mid to late
morning, with VFR conditions likely returning around 18Z and
continuing for much of the region. Guidance suggests we could see
fog develop once again in the North Bay valleys tonight, perhaps a
few hours later than what we saw this morning. Medium to low
confidence in the fog forecast for the fog potential in the North
Bay Valleys tonight. Medium to high confidence with VFR conditions
prevailing elsewhere.

Vicinity of SFO...A few high clouds have streamed over the area
this morning, with VFR conditions prevailing. The forecast for SFO
this morning is medium to low as most models project SFO staying
VFR. However, there are a few hi-res models that suggest SFO could
see IFR to MVFR visibilities shortly after sunrise for a few hours.
Opted to keep the pessimistic forecast in there, but that may need
to be adjusted depending on what happens. After mid to late morning,
VFR conditions are expected.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO; however, the models that
showed lower VIS around SFO suggested LIFR VIS over the Bay.
Confidence is low in the fog forecast for the Bay and around the SFO
terminal this morning.

Monterey Bay Terminals...There is some uncertainty if we`ll be
gifted with the opportunity for a sunrise surprise of fog.
Confidence is on the low for the VIS mentioned at MRY and SNS this
morning as satellite has only really shown a fluctuating blip of low
cloud or fog between the two sites. Once mid to late morning hits,
VFR conditions should prevail through the forecast period. Though
some models try to bring in reduced CIG or VIS tonight. Confidence
was too low to bring any strong mention of those conditions.

.MARINE...
(Today through Wednesday)
Issued at 908 AM PDT Fri Oct 17 2025

Moderate northerly breezes will continue through the end of this
week. Today, fresh to strong gusts will are expected for the
northern most outer waters, perhaps lingering into Saturday
morning. A longer period northwesterly swell arrives this weekend
7 to 10 feet at 15 seconds. Northerly winds should become fresh to
strong late Sunday into Monday, with near gale force gusts
expected for the outer waters north of Point Pinos.

&&

.BEACHES...
Issued at 1249 AM PDT Fri Oct 17 2025

A long-period northwesterly swell with periods of around 15 to 17
seconds is approaching the coast through the day and will begin
impacting the coastal waters tonight. The long-period swell
increases the risk of sneaker waves and rip currents across the
Pacific coast, potentially catching unaware swimmers off-guard.
Never turn your back to the ocean! Swim near a lifeguard if
possible! If caught in a rip current, swim parallel to shore until
you escape its influence.
