.SHORT TERM...
Issued at 314 AM PST Sat Feb 14 2026
(Today and tonight)

High clouds have built in ahead of the approaching upper level
trough. This has limited fog development so far this morning to
pockets of the North Bay Valley and the Salinas Valley. High
resolution guidance shows some potential for fog cover to expand
into portions of the East Bay Valleys. The incoming high clouds
should help keep the surface insulated enough that widespread fog
outside of the favored valleys is unlikely. This morning will be the
last dry day of the upcoming week as an upper level trough arrives
and ejects the upper level ridge currently over us to the east.
Temperatures will be slightly cooler today in part thanks to the
incoming high clouds and thanks to a cooler air mass being advected
in ahead of this system. Highs will largely be in the mid 50s across
the North Bay and upper 50s to low 60s across the rest of the Bay
Area and Central Coast. Rain chances increase late this evening into
Sunday with light rain spreading into the North Bay and along the
coast. Rain will increase overnight Saturday into Sunday with light
to moderate rain spreading across the rest of the Bay Area and
Central Coast. Winds strengthen Saturday night with widespread gusts
between 20 to 30 mph. Locally higher gusts 30 to 40 mph are expected
across the higher terrain with some potential for locally stronger
gusts across the Santa Lucia Range where a coastal jet looks to set
up offshore over the marine environment. A 10-20% chance of embedded
thunderstorms exists tonight across the marine environment and
directly along the coastline. The highest chances will be offshore
but there is still the potential for a thunderstorm or two to
develop over land tonight.

.LONG TERM...
Issued at 314 AM PST Sat Feb 14 2026
(Sunday through Friday)

Widespread moderate to at times heavy rain will expand across the
region Sunday morning and continue through Monday as the first of a
series of three storms moves through the region. This first system
will bring around 1-2" of rain to the lower elevations and 2-4"
across the coastal mountain ranges. Locally higher totals to around
5" are expected in the Santa Lucia Range where the heaviest rain is
expected to occur. A marginal risk of excessive rainfall is in
effect Monday for the Central Coast and South Bay with a slight risk
of excessive rainfall extending along the coast from the Monterey
Peninsula into southern California. High temperatures on Sunday
will be similar to Saturday in the mid 50s to low 60s, however,
temperatures will be noticeably cooler by Monday. Temperatures
drop everywhere into the low to mid 50s with the portions of the
elevated terrain staying in the 40s. At the same time, widespread
gusts to 30 to 40 mph spread across the region on Sunday, briefly
diminish overnight, then restrengthen during the day on Monday.
The combination of cooler temperatures, gustier winds, and rain
will make being outside feel much cooler than highs in the 50s
suggest.

The next system will arrive Monday night and continue through
Wednesday with an additional 1-1.5" of rain expected across the
region with an additional 2-3" across the Santa Cruz Mountains and
Santa Lucia Range. Embedded thunderstorms will be possible with a 10-
20% chance continuing each day this week. Low level shear is much
weaker compared to what was observed in December so rotating
thunderstorms are unlikely at this time. This system will be much
colder as a colder air mass from the Gulf of Alaska advects in. High
temperatures on Wednesday will be in the upper 40s to mid 50s while
low temperatures drop into the 30s Tuesday morning before becoming
more widespread Wednesday morning. Cold Weather Advisories will be
needed for at least the North Bay Valleys and interior Central
Coast. This is likely to extend into other portions of the Bay Area
by late week as overnight temperatures continue to cool. Winds
remain gusty as this next system arrive with widespread gusts
between 30 to 40 mph expected. A Wind Advisory for 40+ mph gusts
will be needed for portions of the Central Coast (particularly the
Santa Lucia Range) Monday night into Tuesday where a low level jet
will be oriented perpendicular to the coastline. Confidence is
slightly lower that a Wind Advisory will be necessary for the rest
of the Bay Area but cannot fully rule out the higher elevations and
areas directly along the coastline needing one as well. Winds then
diminish throughout the day on Wednesday. A third weaker system
arrives Thursday and generally brings light rain, up to half an
inch, to the region. Flooding concerns will initially start out low
but will increase with each successive day of rainfall. While the
heaviest rain is expected between the first two systems, any
flooding already occurring will be made worse by the additional
light rainfall late this week. Mainstream rivers show a low (< 10%)
chance of minor flooding occuring at the San Lorenzo River at Big
Trees, Pajaro River at Chittenden, and Salinas River at Spreckles.

With the much cooler airmass moving in early this week, snow levels
will drop to around 2000 ft (far North Bay) and to around 3000 ft
across the rest of the Bay Area and Central Coast. This is
increasing the likelihood of snow across the highest peaks of Mt.
St. Helena/Mt. Hood/Mt. Vaca, the eastern Santa Clara Hills, the
Santa Cruz Mountains, the Santa Lucia Range, and the Gabilan
Range. Snow accumulations across the highest peaks will be between
2-7" with locally higher totals in the Santa Lucia Range and the
Gabilan Range. There is the potential for some light accumulating
snow within the Santa Cruz Mountains which may result in some
snowfall along Highway 9 and nearby mountain communities. The
overall snowfall forecast will continue to evolve as we get within
range of the high resolution models. As mentioned by the previous
forecaster, there is some potential for higher end snowfall
scenarios to take place if a more convective band is able to
develop. Make sure to stay up to date on the forecast to see how
this forecast continues to evolve.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 455 AM PST Sat Feb 14 2026

High clouds continue to build as the low pressure system approaches
the coast. Spotty MVFR level CIGs have been forming and eroding
through the night, but will have better chances at staying
consistent in the mid to late morning. Coastal cloud cover arrives
into the afternoon, causing MVFR CIGs for to continue at HAF and
build for the Monterey Bay. Scattered light showers arrive in the
evening, despite CIGS scattering. Stronger southerly to
southeasterly winds arrive into the late night as the front nears.
Breezy to gusty southerly winds build into Sunday morning as light
to moderate rains begin to arrive.

Vicinity of SFO...Light winds with inconsistent MVFR CIGs are
affecting the SF Bay with high clouds continuing to build. Chances
for lower CIGs erode into the mid to late morning. Expect moderate
south winds to build in the mid afternoon. These winds turn more
southeast in the evening as light showers enter the area. Gusty
Southeast winds arrive into early Sunday morning with more
consistent rain showers.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...Moderate Southeast winds continue to affect
SNS into the afternoon while winds at MRY stay light through the
late morning. Expect some MVFR level CIGs to form in the late
morning and early afternoon around the Monterey Bay. Winds go
northwesterly for SNS while MRY stays southerly in the afternoon.
Light showers move through the area into the night as winds become
moderate and southerly. Rain chances increase into early Sunday.

.MARINE...
(Today through Thursday)
Issued at 314 AM PST Sat Feb 14 2026

Storm systems will move through the region starting tonight and
last through much of the week. This will bring hazardous
conditions across the coastal waters starting late Saturday. By
Sunday expect periods of heavy rain while a strong southerly
breeze generates rough seas. After frontal passage winds will
shift to westerly and quickly restrengthen to fresh to strong
through mid week as a high westerly swell arrives. Thunderstorm
chances increase behind the initial front, and return again in the
early work week.
