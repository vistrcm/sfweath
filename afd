...New UPDATE...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 1218 AM PDT Sun Apr 7 2024

Dry weather prevails through the extended forecast with a gradual
warm up through the week. All eyes on mid-to-late week with
potential early season heat-related impacts.

&&

.UPDATE...
Issued at 902 AM PDT Sun Apr 7 2024

Forecast remains on track this morning. Temperatures are running
about 2 to 4 degrees warmer than this time yesterday, which tracks
with the forecast daytime highs being about 2 to 4 degrees warmer
than yesterday. The departing upper trough does have a weak
surface reflection which is providing a focus area for a few
showers out over the ocean. As daytime heating occurs, there is an
outside probability, less than about 15%, of a shower popping up
over some of the mountains in the area. At minimum, expect to see
clouds develop over the mountains this afternoon. Nothing of
significant note is expected at this time, but we`ll continue to
monitor an environmental changes.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 1218 AM PDT Sun Apr 7 2024

Weak, elevated cold front moving through overnight fairly
uneventful bringing only light, scattered showers well out over
the waters and some high clouds streaming across the region.
Otherwise pleasant week ahead with temps slightly below normal and
clearing skies today. Breezy conditions this afternoon with
northwest wind gusts 25-30 mph along the coast and favored NW-SE
gap areas.

.LONG TERM...
(Monday through Saturday)
Issued at 1218 AM PDT Sun Apr 7 2024

Monday kicks off the stretch of average to above average temps
across the region with the upper low moving out and broad, high
amplitude ridging settling in for the week. By Tuesday, we`ll be
looking at afternoon highs in the mid-to-upper 70s across interior
valleys with 60s to lower 70s along the coast. Wednesday looks to
be the warmest day of the week as many locations across interior
valleys break the 80 degree mark with some even seeing the
mid-80s, 10 to 15 degrees above seasonal normals for these areas.
While these temperatures are common during the summer months,
these first couple of rounds of warm weather for the season can be
rather sneaky in terms of overall risk. Even though we live with
these temperatures every year during the warm season, we still go
through an acclimation as we change seasons. The 80 degree temps through
the middle of this week will feel warmer than 80 degrees
experienced in September since it`s the warmest of the season so
far. Because of this, inland areas retain minor Heat Risk Monday
through Thursday, which means that individuals who are extremely
sensitive to heat may experience issues, especially when outdoors
without effective cooling and/or adequate hydration. I know what
you`re thinking, "it`s only 80 degrees...we hit 95 all the time in
the summer!" Yes, it`s true. It is *only* 80 degrees when you
compare it to the typical peak summertime heat, but this is when
we urge people who are susceptible to heat-related illness to use
a little extra caution. It doesn`t stand out like our 100 degree
days do, but 80-85 can certainly be impactful for some given that
it`s early-season and has generally been on the cooler side over
the past few weeks. Bottom line, it`s going to be a gorgeous week
ahead. Go outside and enjoy it if you`re able. Just pack a little
extra water.

By the end of the week, the ridge starts to break down and migrate
eastward as another deep upper trough moves into the PNW, bringing
us back to near seasonal average temperatures by next weekend.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 426 AM PDT Sun Apr 7 2024

Overall flight conditions will remain favorable, although there
will be some strong wind gusts in the afternoon. Mainly VFR
conditions under some high clouds. An hour or two of IFR mist is
possible in the North Bay terminals before 16Z. APC has already
reported VIS as low as 1.5 mi this morning, but has since improved
as a light breeze picked up. STS has held off so far, but with a
narrowing dew point depression and downstream river fog visible on
the ALERT CA cameras, the chances are increasing as we approach
sunrise with calm winds. Otherwise, there is some patchy low
clouds in the Bay Area terminals, which are unlikely to form a
ceiling at SFO and OAK, but SJC may go in and out of broken MVFR
CIGs before 16Z. These clouds will clear in the mid- morning.
Moderate to strong onshore flow will develop again this afternoon.

Vicinity of SFO...VFR through the TAF period with some scattered low
level clouds in the morning. Onshore winds will steadily increase
through the first half of the day, eventually gusting to 20-30
mph in the afternoon before decreasing Sunday night.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...VFR through the majority of the TAF
period. Gentle winds will gradually increase to a moderate to
fresh onshore breeze in the afternoon. There is a 40% chance of
MVFR ceilings at Monterey early Monday morning.

.MARINE...
(Today through Friday)
Issued at 426 AM PDT Sun Apr 7 2024

A weak cold front is moving through the coastal waters  early this
morning. As building high pressure behind the front  increases the
gradient with inland troughing, a moderate NW wind  wind will
increase to a strong breeze through the day Sunday. These  winds
will cause rough seas to build in the exposed waters.  Conditions
will improve mid-week, however some long range guidance  is
hinting that gale force winds and very rough seas are possible
next weekend.
