.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 126 AM PDT Fri Oct 27 2023

Cold overnight lows expected through Saturday morning with frost
possible within the North Bay valleys. Gusty offshore winds
develop this weekend with elevated fire weather conditions. Fire
Weather Watch in effect for the North Bay interior mountains, the
East Bay Hills, the Eastern Santa Clara Hills, and the Santa Cruz
Mountains Saturday morning through Sunday evening.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 126 AM PDT Fri Oct 27 2023

Water vapor imagery early this morning revealed mid-level moisture
approaching from the west in association with upper troughing and a
weak surface low. The low should gradually fill while remaining
offshore thus keeping and light precipitation chances well away from
the region. Meanwhile a positively tilted longwave trough will drop
down closer to our area from the north. This pattern will result in
benign weather across the area today with sunshine and some passing
high clouds at times. Temperatures will be on the cool side with
highs mostly in the 60s. Winds will be light and onshore during the
afternoon and evening.

Tonight should provide a decent radiational cooling setup. While
some high clouds may be around, a consensus of forecast models
suggest they should be waning as the night goes on. Surface winds
appear light and decoupled prior to sunrise, with decent overnight
humidity recoveries. Temperatures will drop into the 30s and 40s,
with the warmest readings along the coast and bays. Conditions
appear supportive of frost formation within the North Bay Valleys as
temperatures should drop into the mid to upper 30s. For this reason
hoisted a Frost Advisory for this area from late tonight into
Saturday morning. Now that we`re getting into the cold season this
is a good reminder to protect people, pets, plants and pipes from
the cold.

.LONG TERM...
(Saturday through Thursday)
Issued at 126 AM PDT Fri Oct 27 2023

This Weekend:

The forecast remains on track with a dry offshore wind event
anticipated this weekend. The synoptic picture is consistent with
troughing over the interior west (the "Inside Slider" setup) and a
backdoor front sweeping through our area. This pattern will enhance
the pressure gradient off the Sierra as strong surface high pressure
settles over the northern Rockies. A consensus of forecast models
and their ensembles (NAM, GFS, and GEFS) suggest the offshore
pressure gradient (WMC-SFO) will reach minus 13 to 15 mb between 06-
15Z Sunday, setting the stage for a multi-hour event. Placing
this in context, these pressure gradient values are consistent
with those previously observed during moderate to strong offshore
wind events in the Bay Area. We`re now within range where the
higher resolution mesoscale models come into play, and they are
painting the same picture. Northeast winds developing initially to
our northeast early Saturday with the stronger winds pushing
southwest through the core of the Bay Area from late Saturday into
Sunday morning. These winds will transport very dry air into the
region resulting in poor Saturday morning humidity recoveries with
afternoon values likely in the 10-25 percent range for most of
the Bay Area on Sunday. This sets the stage for enhanced fire
weather conditions, with the greatest focus on the North Bay
Interior Mountains, the Marin Coastal Range, the East Bay and
Santa Clara Hills, and the Santa Cruz Mountains. Wind speeds of
35- 55 mph are expected for ridgetops, with some breeziness
perhaps making it into the neighboring valleys as well. Given
increased confidence in both strong sustained winds and gusts
decided to issue a Wind Advisory for the North Bay interior
mountains, the East Bay Hills, the Eastern Santa Clara Hills, and
the Santa Cruz Mountains from Saturday afternoon into Sunday. So
not only will there be strong winds to contend with, but the
combination of gusty winds and critically low humidity values
suggest that enhanced fire weather concerns are in play. A Fire
Weather Watch remains in effect for the previously mentioned
mountain areas from early Saturday morning through early Sunday
evening. For more details please see the fire weather discussion
appended below. A few safety tips to remember are:

* Properly dispose of cigarettes and matches
* Do not use a lawn mower or weeds or dry grass
* Avoid using equipment that creates sparks
* Make sure campfires are completely put out
* Make sure no vehicle parts drag on the ground, including towing
  chains
* Obey burn bans & only burn with a permit

Monday through Thursday:

A shortwave ridge aloft should set up over the region initially with
dry conditions and slightly warmer temperatures. A more progressive
and zonal pattern evolves by late week with shower chances possible

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 412 AM PDT Fri Oct 27 2023

High confidence that clear skies and VFR conditions prevail through
the TAF period. Some model output has a low probability of low
stratus at the Monterey Bay and interior East bay for Friday evening
into Saturday morning, but this is such a low confidence forecast
that it almost does not merit a mention. Generally light winds
through the night, with northwesterly flow at up to 10-15 knots
developing Friday afternoon.

Vicinity of SFO... VFR through the TAF period. Light winds continue
through the morning before northwest winds gusting up to 15-20 knots
build in the afternoon, diminishing again in the evening.

SFO Bridge Approach... Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals... High confidence of VFR through the TAF
period, low confidence of scattered low clouds this evening into
Saturday morning. Light drainage winds into the morning, with breezy
west-northwest winds up to 8-12 knots this afternoon before light
winds diminish again in the evening.

.MARINE...
(Today through Wednesday)
Issued at 412 AM PDT Fri Oct 27 2023

North to northwest winds remain strong along the southern coastal
waters through the morning, remaining light to gentle elsewhere.
Winds will build in the northern outer waters tonight into
Saturday, then diminishing on Sunday leading to calm conditions
into the next work week.

.FIRE WEATHER...
Issued at 250 PM PDT Thu Oct 26 2023

Offshore wind setup slated for the weekend will bring elevated
fire weather conditions to the North Bay, East Bay hills, and the
Santa Cruz Mtns. Increasing confidence in the track of an upper
low through the Great Basin will cause a surface high pressure to
build across the interior regions Saturday. Ensemble guidance
advertising the SFO-WMC pressure gradient in the -12 to -14 mb
range during the time from about noon Saturday through noon
Sunday, which is approaching the 99th percentile. This set up
promotes widespread offshore flow with high confidence. Wind gusts
along ridgetops expected to be in the 35-45 mph range, with
moderate confidence that a few of the favored spots such as Mt.
St. Helena and Mt. Diablo could see gusts to 50 mph. Minimum RH
during the afternoons Saturday and Sunday will be in the 15-20%
range across much of the area as the downsloping offshore winds
increase. Overnight recoveries aren`t much better between 25-45%.

The limiting factors with this event are related to the fuel
conditions and the degree of stability in the valleys. In regards
to the fuels, there is less concern in the more dense 100 and 1000
hour fuels as much of the moisture is still retained from recent
rains. Much more concern lies in the finer, more flashy fuels,
such as grasses and shrubbery. Stability presents some degree of
uncertainty to the wind forecast in valley areas. These areas are
still expected to be breezy through the weekend, but not as high
as their adjacent mountains and hills. If the valleys are able to
hold on to their moisture a little longer with weaker flow near
the surface, the atmosphere would remain largely decoupled and
the highest gusts would remain in the higher terrain. The worst
case scenario would be the stability completely eroding allowing
the highest gusts to mix down into the valley floors. We will be
keeping a close eye on this over the coming shifts and update the
forecast as needed.
