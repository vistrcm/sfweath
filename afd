...New UPDATE, AVIATION, MARINE...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 106 AM PST Fri Dec 22 2023

Patchy fog is being reported across the North Bay Valleys and may
spread to the bay shoreline through the morning hours today.
Dry, benign weather is in store through the Christmas holiday with
the exception of cooler overnight lows this weekend. Pattern
change to wetter weather is expected after Christmas, but still
too far to nail down the details on amounts, impacts, etc.

.UPDATE...
Issued at 307 AM PST Fri Dec 22 2023

A Dense Fog Advisory has been issued for the North Bay interior
valleys through 10 AM this morning. While dense fog remains patchy
over the N Bay, dangerous impacts to commuters, especially along the
101 corridor between Santa Rosa and Novato, will persist through mid
morning.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 106 AM PST Fri Dec 22 2023

Patchy dense fog has been developing across the North Bay valleys
and portions of the East Bay shoreline as a result of shallow, moist
layer at lower levels and stable atmospheric conditions. This fog is
patchy in nature, as indicated by the bouncing around of visibility
observations at KAPC and KSTS airports from 1/4 mile then back up to
2-4 miles. Highway webcam images also show that fog is rather
patchy, so holding off for now on the issuance of a Dense Fog
Advisory as the question remains how widespread the fog will become,
but thinking is that it will become more widespread as winds
diminish. There`s been good consensus among hi-res models that
portions of the Santa Clara Valley near the bay shoreline will
see fog start to develop after 4-5 am, so will continue to monitor
through the night and early morning. Use caution on your morning
commute and be prepared for sudden changes in visibility esp if
driving through the North Bay and the East Bay shoreline.

By late morning, an approaching dry cold front dropping down from
the Gulf of Alaska will help to mix the lower levels of the
atmosphere, helping to dissipate any fog that does develop overnight
by 9-11 am this morning. This dry cold frontal passage will bring
breezy north/northwest winds to the Bay Area and Central Coast. Not
expecting overly strong northerly winds, but high peaks could see
gusts of 20 to 30 mph by the late evening today.

.LONG TERM...
(Saturday through Thursday)
Issued at 106 AM PST Fri Dec 22 2023

500 mb ridge of high pressure will start to build in Saturday,
resulting in dry, mild weather. The main weather concern for the
weekend will be cooler overnight lows with Sunday morning looking to
be the coldest morning with lows in the mid 30s to upper 40s across
the valleys.

A shortwave trough will brush through the Pacific NW Sun-Mon,
briefly dampening 500 mb heights. However once this feature passes
through, ridge will resume building over the West Coast, which will
result in a subtle warming trend through Tuesday. Interior valleys
south of the SF Bay will see temps around Christmas reach mid to
upper 60s, so expecting it to be a rather pleasant holiday with
benign weather expected.

A pattern shift is still looking on track for after Christmas, but
model guidance is pushing back the timing of arrival of the next
round of rain to the 27th-28th. Unsettled conditions look to
continue into the New Year as per long range ensemble guidance, so
there could possibly be multiple rounds of rain beginning the 27th
lasting into early January. Stay tuned for forecast updates as
details remain fuzzy. The CPC 8-14 day hazards outlook highlights
much of Central California for a moderate risk of heavy precip
while the coastline is highlighted for potential strong winds,
which could potentially impact travel plans for folks returning
home from the holidays.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 307 AM PST Fri Dec 22 2023

Patchy fog across the North Bay valleys, expected to mix out around
17-18Z as a dry cold front mixes out the lower atmosphere. Still
seeing some model guidance for fog developing at the other Bay Area
terminals, but high clouds seen on satellite imagery are limiting
radiational cooling, lowering the confidence in fog development
across the SF Bay Area. Will continue to monitor fog evolution into
the mid-morning hours. Otherwise, VFR continues through the daytime
with breezy northwest flow across the region. Model output showing
MVFR-IFR stratus near the southern Monterey bay this evening, and a
lower confidence for patchy ceilings elsewhere in the SF Bay Area.

Vicinity of SFO... Currently VFR with high level clouds. Confidence
is decreasing in any fog or low stratus development for the rest of
the morning. Chances for fog increase if high clouds clear out from
the terminal. If fog develops, expect it to mix out by around 18-
19Z. Will monitor fog development into the morning hours. Moderate
to high confidence that VFR then continues for the rest of the TAF
period. Afternoon west-northwest winds will gust up to 20-25 knots.
Some model output is suggesting a chance for MVFR ceilings, but this
is low confidence and probabilities are higher (up to 20%) in the
East Bayshore.

SFO Bridge Approach... Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals... MVFR stratus builds into the MRY terminal
area in the morning hours and spreads to SNS in the late afternoon,
continuing through the end of the TAF period. Light drainage flow
through the morning hours before light onshore flow begins in the
afternoon.

.MARINE...
(Today through Wednesday)
Issued at 307 AM PST Fri Dec 22 2023

  Breezy to gusty northerly winds developing through the day, with
gale force gusts across the northern outer waters and the coastal
jet regions. Winds diminishing on Saturday, but incoming northwest
swell this weekend and a new storm system mid-week will keep seas
hazardous for small craft through the rest of the work week.
