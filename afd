...New SYNOPSIS, UPDATE...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 825 AM PDT Sat Aug 31 2024

A weak upper level low will gradually drift towards Northern
California over the next 24 to 48 hours, before moving inland on
Monday. As a result, the marine layer may deepen a bit, with some
late night or early morning drizzle possible near the immediate
coast. Otherwise, expect dry conditions will prevail, with
temperatures remaining near to slight below normal through our
holiday weekend. A warming trend will develop for the work week.

.UPDATE...
Issued at 825 AM PDT Sat Aug 31 2024

Water vapor imagery shows a weak upper level low spinning 38.5
North and 135 West this morning. This upper level low will
gradually dig towards Northern California over the next 24 to 48
hours, before moving inland on Monday. This upper level low will
be the primary influencer of our weather through the holiday
weekend, with onshore flow prevailing. For now, just the fewest
of high clouds denote of the center of this low, so expect
predominately clear skies to prevail across the region this
weekend except for the immediate coast with the marine layer
remains. At this time, both the Fort Ord profiler and the 12z
KOAK sounding show that the marine layer is between 1500 and 1600
feet. KOAK also shows that the marine inversion is roughly 13
degrees C, so expect a relatively slow mix out of the marine layer
once again today. The only exception to that will be around the
Monterey Bay area, where the stratus is already somewhat patchy in
nature. Meanwhile, temperatures are running within plus or minus
1 degree, and expect this trend to continue through the day, with
day time temperatures near or slightly below normal. As this low
moves closer to the coast for Sunday, the marine layer should
deepen a bit in response, with a minor cooling trend for our
inland areas continuing. Current forecast is handling these
trends well, so no update is planned at this time.  Palmer

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 208 AM PDT Sat Aug 31 2024

The last day of meteorological summer will be near normal to
slightly below normal for temperatures, with the exception of the higher
elevations. The marine layer is currently observed at about 1,500
feet. Low clouds are expected to make a late comeback this
morning, receding back towards the coastline by this afternoon.
This somewhat deep marine layer will be able to precipitate out
coastal drizzle thanks to the lifting mechanisms of the cutoff low
off the coast of the California/Oregon border in addition to the
terrain. Winds will be onshore with gusty conditions expected
through gaps and passes.

Let`s talk Labor Day weekend safety. While the weather is
relatively quiet, it does not mean that there are not other
hazards out there.

Water safety:

-Whenever possible, swim at beaches with lifeguards. The chances of
drowning at a beach with lifeguards are 1 in 18 million.

-Do what experienced surfers and lifeguards do: watch the ocean for
at least 20 minutes. Study its wave patterns. Get a feel for the
pattern of the waves before relaxing on the beach or engaging in
recreational activities.

-Cold water shock can be just as severe and dangerous from water
temperatures of 50-60F as it is from water at 35F. Wearing a
life jacket significantly increases chances of survival.

-Never turn your back on the ocean.

Fire safety:

-Use grills/smokers on gravel or paved surfaces.

-Keep water stored near campfires, fire pits, grills, smokers,
burning brush, etc.

-Maintain vehicle brakes and tires, and secure tow chains to avoid
dragging. Don`t drive on dry grass or brush.

.LONG TERM...
(Sunday through Friday)
Issued at 208 AM PDT Sat Aug 31 2024

Sunday and Monday will be similar to what is expected today as the
cutoff low traverses off to the east, eventually becoming an open
wave. Ridging will immediately take shape Tuesday on the heels of
the aforementioned cutoff low. Widespread moderate HeatRisk is
expected Tuesday-Friday with Wednesday forecast to be the hottest
day of the week. Fire weather concerns will also increase
Tuesday-Friday due to poor relative humidity recoveries above the
marine layer, namely the North Bay Interior Mountains, Santa Cruz
Mountains, East Bay Hills, Eastern Santa Clara Hills, Santa Lucia
Mountains and Los Padres National Forest, and Mountains of San
Benito and Interior Monterey County including Pinnacles National
Park. Winds aren`t forecast to be strong during this time, but
they are forecast to become northerly/offshore during the
overnight periods. Nonetheless, it is imperative to remain
vigilant when it comes to fire safety.

(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 511 AM PDT Sat Aug 31 2024

MVFR and IFR CIGS move are inland and will widespread through the
mid morning. Expect mostly light winds as the cloud cover builds.
CIGS are set to erode in the late morning and early afternoon.
Moderate to breezy winds return into the afternoon with some
breezier winds along the coast. Expect these winds to reduce become
lighter into the evening. Lower clouds move inland again Saturday
evening, affecting the Monterey Bay terminals with MVFR CIGs with
some pockets of mist and fog possible. CIGs become widespread later
that night.

Vicinity of SFO...MVFR CIGs with moderate winds last through the
late morning. CIGS erode in the late morning with breezy winds
returning this afternoon and lingering into the early night. Winds
reduce into Saturday night before MVFR CIGs return.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO

Monterey Bay Terminals...MVFR CIGs and light winds last through the
late morning. Expect moderate winds and VFR into the afternoon and
through the evening before lighter winds and CIGs return. MVFR CIGs
move inland in the evening and pockets of mist.

.MARINE...
(Today through Thursday)
Issued at 511 AM PDT Sat Aug 31 2024

Expect the pattern of afternoon gusty west winds through the
Golden Gate and into the northern San Francisco Bay into the next
work week. Northwesterly winds will strengthen over the southern
coastal zones, specifically near Point Sur this weekend building
moderate seas. By early next week stronger synoptic NW winds will
build rough seas in the northern zones.
