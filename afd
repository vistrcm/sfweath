.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 1232 AM PDT Sat Aug 10 2024

Hot temperatures continue inland today, before a significant cooling
trend begins on Sunday into early next week.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 1232 AM PDT Sat Aug 10 2024

The weakening ridge continues to be the main force impacting our
weather, but the global models suggest that before it fades away
into nothingness, it`s going to make one last run at giving us warm
weather across the region. As with yesterday, widespread stratus
this morning across the valleys and breezy afternoon and evening
winds are expected. Temperatures today are also expected to remain
similar to those we saw yesterday, and if anything, might even tick
up a couple of degrees. Low temperatures this morning continue in
the 50s into the low 60s in the valleys and up to the mid 70s across
the thermal belts. As for high temperatures, the inland valleys
continue to see highs in the mid 80s into the mid 90s, with
temperatures up to 100-105 in the warmest spots, while the Bayshore
sees temperatures in the 70s into the lower 80s and the Pacific
coast remains in the upper 50s to mid 60s.

.LONG TERM...
(Sunday through Friday)
Issued at 1232 AM PDT Sat Aug 10 2024

Ensemble model output continues to show an upper level trough
forming across the West Coast Sunday, with high temperatures inland
dropping into the upper 70s into the lower 90s (with some highs near
100 in the warmest regions of the Central Coast) as a result. The
beginning of the upcoming work week continues the cooling trend, and
by mid-week, inland highs should bottom out in the mid 70s to upper
80s. The coastal regions remain relatively stable in the mid 50s to
the mid 60s. CPC outlooks continue to show a lean towards
temperatures at or below seasonal averages into the first week of
September.

.MARINE...
(Today through Thursday)
Issued at 412 AM PDT Sat Aug 10 2024

The pressure gradient between subtropical high pressure and lower

strong northwesterly breeze. These breezes will build rough seas
over the outer waters.
