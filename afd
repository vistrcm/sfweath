...New UPDATE, MARINE...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 1212 AM PDT Tue Aug 20 2024

Slight warming continues today into Wednesday, before a rare August
cold front brings gusty winds, cooler weather, and a chance for rain
Thursday and Friday.

&&

.UPDATE...
Issued at 858 AM PDT Tue Aug 20 2024

Sunny skies prevail across the region with a few high clouds
streaming over the North Bay. Otherwise, the forecast remain on
track with afternoon temperatures warming into the upper 60`s to
lower 70`s at the coast to upper 80`s across the interior. No
updates are needed at this time.

&&

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 1212 AM PDT Tue Aug 20 2024

Skies remain clear across the region and are mainly expected to
remain generally clear through the rest of the day, with some mid-to
high-level clouds coming over the North Bay. A weakening upper level
trough off the Pacific Northwest enables the continuation of a
slight warming trend across the region. Low temperatures this
morning remain in the 50s to low 60s in the lower elevations, up to
the mid to upper 60s in the higher elevations. Highs today range
from the mid 80s ti the low 90s in the inland valleys, the 70s
across the Bayshore, and the upper 50s to the 60s along the Pacific
coast. Breezy onshore flow continues to develop in the afternoons
and evenings, with gusts up to 20 to 30 miles per hour in the gaps,
passes, and Salinas Valley.

&&

.LONG TERM...
(Tuesday night through next Sunday)
Issued at 127 PM PDT Mon Aug 19 2024

On Wednesday, the disturbance will move through the Pacific
Northwest kicking off a cooling trend. This pattern change will
also allow the marine layer to become reestablished, bringing low
stratus back to the coastal areas. This disturbance will also
pave the way for a much deeper low pressure system on Thursday.
This system is pretty anomalous for August, with 500 mb heights
near the 4th standard deviation. The expected 850 mb temperature
is around 6C, which is normal for January, but around 12C below
the August median value, and near the minimum moving average. This
deep low pressure system will push a cold front through the Bay
Area, bringing gusty winds on Thursday, much cooler temperatures
on Friday, and a slight chance of rain both days. The system won`t
hang around long, and the temperature will rebound back to normal
by Sunday with above average temps possible next week.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 332 AM PDT Tue Aug 20 2024

VFR through the TAF period for the majority of terminals. Winds W/NW
in the afternoon today and breezy to moderate with some gusts
nearing 20 knots, higher at KSFO. Stratus will begin to approach the
coastline in the late night of Tuesday to early morning of
Wednesday, though confidence is low as to whether CIGs will develop
at terminals given that models do not indicate much of an inland
push of stratus.

Vicinity of SFO...VFR through the majority of the TAF period, but
becoming MVFR in the early morning of Wednesday. However, confidence
on CIG development at KSFO Wednesday morning is currently low. This
will be something to keep an eye on in future updates. Moderate NW
winds Tuesday afternoon and evening are likely to gust just below 30
knots. However, gusts should diminish into the nighttime.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...VFR through the TAF period, moderate
confidence. Stratus is likely to approach the terminal early
Wednesday morning, though current model agreement does not show
stratus forming much in the way of CIGs over KMRY. If anything,
highest confidence is in SCT-FEW low clouds developing over the
terminal in that time period. Otherwise, breezy NW winds return this
afternoon.

&&

.MARINE...
(Today through Sunday)
Issued at 858 AM PDT Tue Aug 20 2024

Moderate to breezy winds persist into the late week. A strong,
early season upper level low will dig southward from Alaska
reaching the Pacific Northwest and far northern California late
this week. As a result, slight chances of rain will arrive Friday.
Dry weather returns Saturday and winds ease to become gentle.

&&

     evening for Pigeon Pt to Pt Pinos 0-10 nm.
