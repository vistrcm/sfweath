.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 333 AM PST Sun Nov 24 2024

Wet weather continues through the early portion of the work week.
Showers are in the forecast for today as a weak trough passes
through. Low pressure forms over the Pacific Monday into Tuesday,
which will bring widespread rain to the region. Drier weather may
try to make a brief appearance for Thanksgiving, with drier weather
expected as we wrap the month up.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 333 AM PST Sun Nov 24 2024

A weak trough skirts over the region today giving us a mix of sun
and clouds. Showers will be possible across the region, with favor
being given to the North Bay region. Southerly winds, especially
over the North Bay and San Francisco Peninsula, will flare up some,
but remain below advisory criteria. Chances for rain will gradually
increase late Sunday into Monday.

.LONG TERM...
(Monday through Saturday)
Issued at 333 AM PST Sun Nov 24 2024

Ensemble and cluster analysis shows an a shortwave trough passing
through the region during the first half of the week. Low pressure
forms to the west over the Pacific, setting up a frontal boundary
feeding moisture into the region. Currently, guidance continues
to favor the placement of this boundary near the Santa Lucias, but
it has wobbled along the Central Coast. Given this
information, opted to keep the higher rainfall amounts along the
Central Coast and Santa Clara County. Should the boundary shift,
amounts will likely shift some. Expect wet weather from Monday into
Tuesday.

From midweek into the weekend, clusters show weak upper level trough
off to our west, with weak ridging trying to form. Thoughts are that
showers should be tapering off from north to south late Tuesday into
Wednesday. Dry weather looks favorable for Thursday, with perhaps a
renewed chance for pop up showers on Friday. As we wrap up the
month, ensembles and clusters favor upper level ridging leading to
drier weather as we head into December.

Another storm system over the Eastern Pacific will bring gusty
winds and more rain to the region. Southerly winds will be
strongest north of Point Reyes on Sunday before increasing across
all coastal waters late Sunday night and Monday. The increasing
winds will result in hazardous conditions for small crafts with
