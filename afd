 - Breezy afternoons and tranquil nights through this week

.UPDATE...
Issued at 910 AM PDT Tue Jul 29 2025

Marine layer around 1200 feet this morning and quickly eroding
back to the coast. Will be watching a well defined vort max
currently located about 300 miles west of Monterey that will
approach the coast later this afternoon and evening. This feature
will increase onshore gradients and winds for the
afternoon/evening seabreeze cycle. In addition expect the marine
layer to deepen to around 1500-2000 feet overnight with more low
clouds spreading inland by Weds morning. The weak troughing,
onshore winds and marine layer will continue to keep temps
running on the cool side of normal with coastal drizzle Weds am.
12z nam and gfs models keep the trend of West Coast trough in
place through at least the end of the work week.

.SHORT TERM...
Issued at 239 AM PDT Tue Jul 29 2025
(Today and tonight)

Quiet weather continues through this week as the persistent trough
pattern off the West Coast refuses to subside, thanks in part to a
blocking upper level high pressure to our east. High confidence in
below average temperatures persisting through the next week based
on ensemble cluster analysis strongly supporting status (stratus)
quo. Despite a robust marine layer to about 1,200 feet, drier air
remains in place, leading to mostly clear skies outside of a few
pockets of marine stratus along coastal areas. This trend will
likely continue through at least midweek.

.LONG TERM...
Issued at 239 AM PDT Tue Jul 29 2025
(Wednesday through Monday)

By the end of the week there is a chance that we could see some
increase in overall moisture that is currently wrapped up in the
parent low near the Gulf of Alaska. This would likely lead to
increase overnight and morning stratus for the latter half of the
week, but no other notable weather change.

One thing that is worth a mention is the chance for offshore
winds just after the long term period by the middle of next week.
There is a weak signal suggesting the ridge over the western CONUS
begins to break down and an upper low moves into the western Great
Basin. This would promote a weak offshore pressure gradient, which
would lead to some degree of warmer and drier offshore wind for
us. While this is 7+ days out and still a weak signal, we aren`t
nailing anything down just yet. Just wanted to make note of this
since we are entering the time of year where impactful offshore
winds are historically more likely. Stay tuned for updates.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 411 AM PDT Tue Jul 29 2025

Currently a mixed bag of IFR-VFR at the terminals with coastal
stratus just beginning to expand. High confidence in widespread VFR
(with the exception of HAF) by this afternoon. An upper-level
shortwave trough will help deepen the marine layer tonight, with
higher confidence in sub-VFR ceilings returning to bayshore and
coastal terminals than interior terminals.

Vicinity of SFO...Currently VFR with westerly flow. Moderate
confidence on VFR holding at the terminal through the afternoon as
satellite presentation and a compressed/shallow marine layer of
1,000 feet supports what guidance/models suggest. If a ceiling were
to develop this morning, it`ll likely be brief and on the cusp of
IFR/MVFR. Westerly winds will prevail through the TAF period. High
confidence (80%) in a sub-VFR ceiling returning tonight, likely on
the cusp of IFR/MVFR.

SFO Bridge Approach...Low stratus clouds will begin to filter into
the approach by 23Z.

Monterey Bay Terminals...Currently IFR with southwesterly flow at
MRY and IFR with northwesterly flow at SNS. High confidence in brief
VFR this afternoon with low stratus sticking close to the coast.
High confidence in sub-VFR ceilings (likely on the cusp of IFR/LIFR)
returning to the terminals tonight. Westerly winds will prevail
through the TAF period.

&&

.MARINE...
(Today through Sunday)
Issued at 239 AM PDT Tue Jul 29 2025

Widespread moderate to fresh northwesterly breezes with strong
gusts will pose hazardous conditions for small craft through the
week for the outer waters and coastal jet regions. For the bays,
strong gusts will come in the form of the diurnally driven
afternoon sea breeze. Moderate to rough seas will prevail through
Saturday.

     for Mry Bay-Pigeon Pt to Pt Pinos 0-10 nm-SF Bay N of Bay
