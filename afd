.SHORT TERM...
Issued at 236 AM PDT Sun Oct 12 2025
(Today and tonight)

It`s going to be a cold start to the morning. Conditions are cooler
and drier than they were 24 hours ago. This is thanks to light
offshore flow and subsequently clear skies that are allowing for
enhanced radiational cooling. Sensible weather today will remain
cool and windy with below normal temperatures and moderate
northwesterly breezes. Wind gusts will be locally stronger along the
coast, down northwest-southeast oriented valleys (namely the North
Bay Interior Valleys, Santa Clara Valley, and Salinas Valley), and
through gaps and passes with gusts up to 30 mph to be expected. If
you have not done so already, there is still time today to clean out
your gutters and secure/store any outdoor items that are sensitive
to rain and/or wind ahead of tomorrow`s system.

.LONG TERM...
Issued at 236 AM PDT Sun Oct 12 2025
(Monday through Saturday)

A gale force low pressure system with support aloft in the form of a
reinforcing upper-level low will begin sliding down the West Coast
today - this will be the driver of our weather the next two days.
The Polar Jet Stream also dives south with this feature, but the
placement doesn`t seem to be too notable for our region in terms of
jet theory. The forecasted arrival time and heaviest rainfall period
has trended earlier as this is now looking like a Monday-Tuesday
event with the heaviest rainfall on Monday rather than a Monday-
Wednesday event with the heaviest rainfall on Tuesday. The brief
drying trend and offshore flow from this weekend has effectively
erased the marine layer with further drying expected through
tonight. As such, virga in the pre-frontal environment will work to
saturate the column early Monday morning ahead of the bulk of the
rainfall with the cold frontal passage Monday afternoon and evening.
The Weather Prediction Center has highlighted the region for a
marginal risk (at least 5%) of rainfall exceeding flash flood
guidance Monday morning through Tuesday morning. This means that
isolated flash floods are possible, but that they would be localized
and primarily affect places that can experience rapid runoff with
heavy rainfall. Post-frontal rain showers and thunderstorms will be
the name of the game on Tuesday. The thunderstorm potential on
Monday and Tuesday can be characterized by low CAPE (500 J/kg) and
conditionally unstable lapse rates (7 degrees Celsius/kilometer).
The Storm Prediction Center has highlighted the region for general
thunder during this time; remember, all thunderstorms are capable of
producing lightning and flooding, when thunder roars, go indoors!
and see a flash, dash inside! When all is said and done, a majority
of the area will accumulate 1.00" with locally higher totals of
1.50"-2.50" in the higher terrain of the East Bay, South Bay, and
Central Coast. This system is also going to be a cold one with 850
millibar temperatures putting daily minimum records in jeopardy.
Near-freezing temperatures are forecast for far interior portions of
Monterey and San Benito Counties Tuesday night. With the recent
rainfall, conditions will feel colder than what the thermometer
reads - please take care of people, pets, and plants. Patchy frost
is also possible during this time for the Interior East Bay and
Interior South Bay.

Global ensemble clusters are in agreement that the upper-level low
will weaken and shift east Wednesday into Thursday with the help of
upper-level shortwave ridging nosing in from the Eastern Pacific
Ocean. This feature will quickly get flattened by an upper-level
shortwave trough, putting the region under the influence of the
eastern periphery of the high pressure over the Eastern Pacific
Ocean. This will translate to a warming and drying trend Wednesday
through Saturday.
