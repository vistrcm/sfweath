...New AVIATION...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 1206 AM PST Mon Dec 11 2023

Look for quiet weather this week with mild days and cool night. A
pattern change takes hold by early next week with a return to wet
and unsettled conditions.

&&

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 1206 AM PST Mon Dec 11 2023

An upper level ridge initially across the region will flatten in
response to a shortwave trough progressing from the Pacific
Northwest into the Great Basin. This pattern change will bring a
more onshore wind component for this afternoon and evening while
increasing boundary layer moisture across coastal portions of the
area. Expect a return of coastal stratus and patchy fog this evening
into Tuesday morning along with warmer overnight coastal and bayside
temperatures. Highs this afternoon with top out mostly in the 60s,
with overnight lows mainly in the upper 30s and 40s. Some of the
colder inland portions of the Central Coast may see readings briefly
dip into the mid or lower 30s towards sunrise.

&&

.LONG TERM...
(Tuesday through Sunday)
Issued at 1206 AM PST Mon Dec 11 2023

The aforementioned shortwave will obtain sufficiently short
wavelength to close off over the Desert Southwest by late week as
transient ridging builds over California. Meanwhile a closed upper
low will approach the region from the eastern Pacific by late week.

An active and unsettled pattern still appears to evolve by early
next week. Model solutions have been rather provocative with a
robust basin-spanning Pacific jet and decent subtropical moisture
tap in play. Rain chances should enter the picture by Saturday and
persist into next week, with an Atmospheric River type setup
potentially in play. Exact details such as timing, rain amounts, and
intensity will be fine tuned in the days ahead. This will be an
evolving forecast so be sure to keep up with changes.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 340 AM PST Mon Dec 11 2023

Another morning with VMC and light winds across most terminals
with the exception of mist/fog at STS. The visibility should
improve at SNS by 17 UTC, in line with yesterday`s timeline.
The fog is quite shallow and may transition to ground fog with
better visibility a few hours prior to clearing. Otherwise, VFR
conditions are expected through the majority of the day before an
approaching trough brings the return of low stratus late Monday.
The details on timing and extent are still subject to change, but
the confidence is high that MVFR or lower stratus will return to
the majority of the terminals at some point Monday night, and the
TAFs have been updated to reflect this scenario.

Vicinity of SFO...No major concerns in the short term, with light
winds and an occasional high cloud. Cirrus coverage will
gradually increase through the day with onshore wind
strengthening in the afternoon. The big question mark is when the
stratus will return tonight. Guidance is pretty confident in
MVFR/IFR ceilings intruding over SFO and OAK at some point, but
the coverage looks spotty. Periods of IMC are possible early
Tuesday morning, but the confidence isn`t high enough to include
ceilings below 1,000 ft in the TAFs at this time.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO although the stratus may
impact the approach 2-4 hours before the terminal.

Monterey Bay Terminals...Currently VFR at both MRY and SNS with
calm winds. MVFR or IFR ceilings are expected to develop at both
terminals overnight. There`s a good chance MRY sees the earliest
arrival of coastal stratus due to the prevailing onshore winds in
the afternoon and proximity and exposure to the coast.

&&

.MARINE...
(Today through Saturday)
Issued at 1206 AM PST Mon Dec 11 2023

Quiet pattern over the next several days with high pressure
dominating. Gusty winds build over the southern waters early this
week as an upper level low deepens into the Great Basin. Slight
chance of showers over the waters late Monday into Tuesday
morning. Winds diminish into the later half of the week as high
pressure builds once again. New storm system approaches next
weekend.

&&

.MTR WATCHES/WARNINGS/ADVISORIES...
CA...None.
PZ...Small Craft Advisory until 3 AM PST Tuesday for Pt Pinos to Pt
     Piedras Blancas 0-10 nm.
