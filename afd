.SYNOPSIS...

Thursday will be dry before a series of weak systems bring light
rain and cold temperatures into the weekend.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today through Friday morning)
Issued at 105 AM PST Thu Jan 4 2024

A look at current nighttime satellite imagery shows
generally clear skies across the area. That being said, tonight is
the peak of the Quandrantids meteor shower, so viewing conditions
are at a prime for most. However, in areas where patchy fog has
developed in portions of Santa Clara and San Benito counties,
viewing of the meteor shower will be generally poor.

As a result of clear skies, temperatures are running a few degrees
cooler now than at this same time yesterday. Mid 40s are widespread
at the moment, with the coldest spots in the North Bay and southern
Monterey County around the upper 30s. Expect morning lows today to
be in the low 40s for the East and South Bay, with more interior
locations seeing slightly colder temperatures in the mid to upper
30s. Friday morning lows to be a few degrees warmer than today
thanks to increased cloud cover, with mid 40s in the Bay regions,
and low 40s for more interior portions. Highs will be in the upper
50s for valleys and bays, and the low 50s for higher elevations both
today and Friday.

A weak disturbance enters into the region late Thursday night
bringing rain chances primarily to the North Bay. Any precipitation
with this system is expected to be light, with only a few hundredths
of an inch accumulating in the North Bay. Come Friday morning, dry
conditions return as the system pushes out.

.LONG TERM...
(Friday through Monday)
Issued at 105 AM PST Thu Jan 4 2024

Looking ahead into the weekend, the next round of light
rain approaches. Early Saturday morning rain chances begin, though
total accumulations are once again expected to be minimal, with far
northern Sonoma County only receiving about 1/4 of an inch, and
further south, generally no more than about 0.10-0.20". Winds
increase behind the frontal passage out of the NW with gusts up to
about 25mph possible at higher elevations, and closer to 20mph at
lower elevations.

What is more noteworthy this coming weekend are upcoming cold
overnight temperatures. Widespread temperatures in the mid to upper
30s are possible for interior portions over the weekend, with low
40s along the coast and bay shorelines. Sunday night into Monday
morning looks to be the chilliest, with a few pockets of upper 20s
possible for far southern Monterey County. No frost or freeze
products have been issued at this time, though this will be
something to stay tuned to the forecast for and to watch closely.
