.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 206 AM PDT Wed Nov 1 2023

High pressure continues to bring dry conditions to the Bay Area
today. An approaching disturbance will bring increasing cloud cover
through the day Thursday with cooler temperature and higher
humidity. A series of weather systems will continue this trend
through the weekend. Rain is likely this weekend, with the highest
accumulation in the North Bay.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 206 AM PDT Wed Nov 1 2023

Wednesday looks very similar to Tuesday. Gentle offshore flow will
bring mostly clear skies. The upper atmosphere will be moist
enough to support some high clouds, which should lead to another
beautiful sunrise and sunset. Cool morning temperatures will
range from the upper 30s in some inland valleys, to mid-upper 40s
along the coast. Similar to yesterday, the deterministic NBM was
running too warm, and a blend favoring cooler ensemble members was
used to better capture the enhanced radiational cooling
overnight. Despite the chilly start to the day, afternoon
temperatures will be above average for this time of year, with
valley highs in the lower 80s and coastal highs in the mid 70s.

.LONG TERM...
(Thursday through Tuesday)
Issued at 206 AM PDT Wed Nov 1 2023

Unsettled weather is on the way. An approaching low pressure system
to the North will signal a change in the weather pattern this week
as the jet stream loses latitude and takes aim at far northern
California. Gentle offshore flow will gradually shift to NW/coast
parallel Thursday and westerly/onshore by Friday. This will cause a
cooling and moistening trend through the weekend. Cloud cover
will increase Thursday and there is a slight chance (15%-30%) of
light rain in the North Bay late Thursday into Friday.

The weekend brings a stronger cold front, and a much higher chance
of rain to the Bay Area. The current forecast calls for rain to
start overnight Friday in the North Bay and gradually move south,
reaching the Monterey Bay by mid-day Saturday. Most of the rain will
fall Saturday, but some light precip is expected to linger through
Sunday, especially south of the Golden Gate. Total accumulation for
the weekend is a bit uncertain. The official forecast is on the
higher end with up to an inch or more to the North Bay valleys, and
more in the mountains. 1/4-1/2 inch or so is expected in the
Peninsula, East Bay, and Santa Cruz. Only light rain is expected in
Santa Clara, Monterey, and San Benito counties, though significant
rain is still possible in higher elevations, especially in the
coastal Santa Lucia mountains of Monterey County.

More rain may be in store early next week. The uncertainty remains
very high, with some global models suggesting more rain than the
weekend event, and others showing hardly any. It will all depend on
how far south the jet stream can get, and right now the models don`t
have a good handle on it.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 419 AM PDT Wed Nov 1 2023

High confidence for VFR at the terminals through the TAF period.
Light offshore and valley drainage winds through the morning, before
shifting to an onshore flow with speeds up to 10 knots this
afternoon. Beyond the TAF period, approaching system will promote
increased wind speeds and low stratus coverage starting Thursday.

Vicinity of SFO... VFR through the TAF period. Light winds through
the morning, with gentle west-northwest breezes up to 10
knots developing this afternoon, diminishing in the evening.

SFO Bridge Approach... Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals... VFR through the TAF period. Valley
drainage flows through the morning, building to around 15 knots at
SNS. Afternoon winds turn towards the northwest and diminish in the
evening.

.MARINE...
(Today through Monday)
Issued at 419 AM PDT Wed Nov 1 2023

Mainly light north to northwest winds and dry weather continues
through mid-week. A plume of subtropical moisture and rain
reaches northernmost California late this week, also bringing a
chance of rain to the coastal waters and bays late this week and
weekend. Light westerly swell with a moderate period continues
through the weekend along with a light long period southerly
swell.

&&

.FIRE WEATHER...
Issued at 206 AM PDT Wed Nov 1 2023

Fire weather concerns continue through Thursday due to dry
conditions. The humidity has improved 3-5% for most areas
compared to 24 hours ago. Surprisingly, however, Santa Cruz,
Monterey, and San Benito counties are 3-5% drier than yesterday.
The minimum humidity today will be in the 10-25% range for most
areas under light offshore flow. Recoveries Wednesday night will
improve to moderate in the North Bay and remain suppressed
elsewhere. Thursday will bring slightly higher (5-10%) RH with the
major improvement coming as onshore flow returns Thursday night
into Friday. Onshore flow will persist through the weekend leading
into a very humid conditions. It`s possible the North Bay will
receive the best wetting rain of the season on Saturday, with
more than an inch possible. Farther south, total accumulations
range from a few hundredths in the Monterey San Benito area to a
few tenths in the greater SF Bay and East Bay regions. Humid
conditions and rain potential continues through the middle of next
week.
