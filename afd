.UPDATE...
Issued at 819 AM PDT Sat Oct 11 2025

Still seeing areas of dense fog linger across the North Bay Valleys
this morning, mainly in Sonoma County. Thus, we have a Dense Fog
Advisory for these areas through 10 AM PDT. These conditions are
forecast to clear out later this morning as surface temperatures
warm. Maximum temperatures are forecast to warm into the mid 60s
near the coast to lower 70s across the interior this Saturday
afternoon as troughing over the West Coast persists. The only
changes were to wind/wind gusts over the coastal waters to reflect
the current trends. No other changes anticipated this morning.

.SHORT TERM...
Issued at 305 AM PDT Sat Oct 11 2025
(Today and tomorrow)

The positively tilted longwave trough will be the driver of our
weather over the weekend. Sensible weather will be cold and windy,
especially today as the trough axis moves through. Winds will likely
be more impactful than the relatively cold temperatures. The
orientation of the aforementioned feature will favor
northwest/southeast oriented valleys, namely the North Bay Interior
Valleys, Santa Clara Valley, and Salinas Valley, as well as the
coastline, gaps, passes, and higher terrain which can expect gusts
up to 40 mph. Preparations for the upcoming system such as cleaning
out gutters, securing loose outdoor items, and properly storing
outdoor items that are sensitive to rain and/or wind should be
finalized this weekend.

.LONG TERM...
Issued at 305 AM PDT Sat Oct 11 2025
(Monday through Friday)

A gale force low pressure system with support aloft in the form of a
reinforcing upper-level low near the Washington/Canada border will
slink down the West Coast beginning Monday. This system will bring
an influx of moisture with precipitable water values exceeding one
inch and IVT values of 250 kg/ms. Between Monday and Wednesday, this
system is forecast to bring widespread rainfall totals of one inch
with locally higher totals of two to three inches in the higher
terrain. As this low is forecast to be off the San Francisco
Peninsula Coast, cyclonic rotation will result in southwesterly flow
into the Central Coast. As a result, the Santa Cruz Mountains and
Big Sur Coast are forecast to receive the most rainfall. The Weather
Prediction Center has highlighted the region for a marginal risk (at
least 5%) of rainfall exceeding flash flood guidance Monday morning
through Wednesday morning. This means isolated flash floods are
possible, but would be localized and primarily affecting places that
can experience rapid runoff with heavy rainfall. Monday and Tuesday
will bring the threat for thunderstorms across the area as the
critical ingredients of lift, instability, and moisture will all be
present. Lift and moisture have already been discussed, so it`s time
to talk about instability. Cold air aloft will destabilize the
atmosphere, yielding conditionally unstable lapse rates of 7 degrees
Celsius/kilometer and low CAPE of 400 Joules/kilogram. The Storm
Prediction Center has highlighted the region for general thunder on
Monday morning through Tuesday morning, this will likely get
extended into Wednesday morning in the next 24 hours or so.
Remember: lightning/flooding threats exist with all thunderstorms,
when thunder roars, go indoors! and see a flash, dash inside! Wind
will be another concern during the Monday and Tuesday timeframe.
There`s up to a 50% chance that locations along the San Francisco
Peninsula Coast, down the Santa Clara and Salinas Valleys, and
through the Altamont Pass reach gusts of 45 mph. As of now, this
does not appear to be long-lived or encompass enough of an area to
warrant a Wind Advisory. Still, loose outdoor items should be
secured ahead of time (ideally this weekend). When it comes to the
rain and wind, extra caution should be exercised when driving next
week. Beyond Wednesday, there is uncertainty in the progression of
the upper-level pattern, but it does look like shortwave ridging
will build, resulting in at least a brief warming and drying
trend.
