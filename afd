...New UPDATE...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 138 AM PST Sat Jan 25 2025

Chilly temperatures begin today and persist into the early part of
next week. Light rain showers expected across the Central Coast and
gusty offshore winds in the North Bay mountains through the weekend,
with the next chance for rain coming towards the latter part of next
week.

.UPDATE...
Issued at 820 AM PST Sat Jan 25 2025

Fog continues to impact the North Bay Valleys this morning but
should improve in the next hour or two. Until then, one should drive
with caution in areas of reduced visibilities. Temperatures continue
to warm slowly, therefore the Frost Advisory will be allowed to
expire at 9 AM this morning. Otherwise, rain showers will be
possible across the Central Coast and points northward (less
widespread). Overall, rainfall amounts will be beneficial and not
amount to much this weekend. Wind Advisory remains in effect through
10 AM Sunday morning for the Interior North Bay Mountains with gusts
up to 50 mph likely. Otherwise, the forecast remains on track this
morning with no updates anticipated at this time.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today through Sunday)
Issued at 138 AM PST Sat Jan 25 2025

Stratus has developed across the coastal regions and the SF Bay
Area, with high clouds moving southward from the South Bay down
through the Central Coast. Low temperatures this morning are
expected to drop into the middle to upper 30s in the inland valleys
and the lower to middle 40s along the coast. A Frost Advisory is in
effect through 9 AM for the North Bay valleys, the interior East
Bay, the eastern Santa Clara hills, the southern Salinas Valley, and
the interior mountains of Monterey and San Benito Counties. Highs
will hover in the lower to middle 50s in the lower elevations and
the 40s in the higher elevations.

Our weather pattern is being driven by a developing shortwave trough
that is descending through the Pacific Northwest, splitting off a
larger trough moving through the Canadian Prairies and south into
the Great Lakes. As the day goes by, the shortwave trough moves into
California and develops a cutoff low over the Bay Area, helping to
reinforce a surface low already over the state. As a result, some
light rain is expected to develop today into Sunday across the
Central Coast, with lighter showers possible into the Bay Area.
Forecast rainfall totals have trended upwards, but remain modest
with the highest totals reaching 0.5-0.75" in the mountains of
southern Monterey and San Benito Counties, and around 0.1-0.3" of
rain across the Monterey Bay region, the Salinas Valley, and
southern Santa Clara County. The cold core low will lead to frigid
temperatures aloft, with the 850 mb (around 1500 ft) temperatures
hovering at nor slightly below freezing. As a result, snow will be
possible at the peaks, with as much as 4-5 inches of snow expected
at the peaks of San Benito Mountain and Junipero Serra Peak.

Across the North Bay, the main forecast issue lies in gusty winds in
the interior mountains, with a Wind Advisory in effect now through
10 AM Sunday morning. Gusts can reach 50 mph across the ridgelines,
resulting in unsecured objects being blown away, difficult driving
for high profile vehicles, and possibly a few power outages. A low
chance for convection and small hail (around 10-15% probability)
also continues across the Central Coast, with the highest
probability late on Sunday, when the SPC has placed the coastal
Central Coast and the Santa Lucias in a general risk for non-severe
thunderstorms. The factors that lead to the current risk remain the
same as messaged last night: a cold upper level low promoting steep
lapse rates, while dry air aloft limiting the chances of lift.

.LONG TERM...
(Monday through Friday)
Issued at 138 AM PST Sat Jan 25 2025

Dry weather should return Monday and stick around through at least
the mid-week as ridging returns to the region. However, clear skies
and light winds in the early part of the week will promote
radiational cooling and lead to potential hazardous conditions. Lows
in the lower to middle 30s in the inland valleys and the upper 30s
into the lower 40s for the coastal regions have resulted in the
issuance of a Freeze Watch for the inland Bay Area and all of the
Central Coast from Sunday morning to Tuesday morning. Remember the
Four P`s of Winter Weather:

People: Dress in layers and wear a hat that covers the ears. Pay
special attention to children and the elderly, who are more
vulnerable to the cold.
Plants: Bring potted plants indoors and keep outdoor plants and
trees protected.
Pets: Bring all pets indoors. Pets and other animals that have to be
kept outdoors should have an enclosed shelter.
Pipes: Make sure all external water pipes are insulated. Keep an
interior faucet running at a drip to prevent ice buildup.

The NBM continues to show a chance for rain to return towards the
latter part of next week, but rainfall amounts and timing depend on
the prognosis of an incoming trough and how quickly it erodes the
ridging. CPC outlooks show a signal for rainfall totals near or
slightly above seasonal averages for the first week of February.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 343 AM PST Sat Jan 25 2025

Complicated/low confidence forecast due to developing low pressure
over Bay Area and Central Coast. Impacts will be patchy dense fog,
MVFR cigs, scattered showers, very low chc (10-15%) thunderstorms,
and variable wind directions through the TAF period. High clouds
continue to slide S and E with low stratus filling in under the
clear skies early Saturday AM. Have amended may TAF sites to keep
the stratus into the morning rush. Dense fog will linger at KSTS
through 15-16Z as well. By this afternoon showers will develop
over the Central Coast and drift northward. TAF sites S of N Bay
will have VCSH this evening through early Sunday. Wind direction
will be a challenge as sfc low pivoting through the region will
cause winds to change direction often.

Vicinity of SFO...CIGs currently around 2k feet through 15Z, but
will have to keep an eye of rapidly clear near West Delta tracking
SW toward terminal. Winds will be switching to NE this morning.
VFR this afternoon and tonight with passing showers poss.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...MVFR cigs through the morning with some
lifting this afternoon to VFR. Scattered showers developing this
afternoon lasting into Sunday.

.MARINE...
(Today through Thursday)
Issued at 343 AM PST Sat Jan 25 2025

unsettled weather to the coastal waters this weekend. Winds will
be strongest over the outer waters north of Point Reyes with gale
force conditions. Rough to very rough seas continue through
Saturday with moderate wave heights and moderate period swell.
Sea state and winds will gradually improve by Monday.
