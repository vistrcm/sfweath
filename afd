.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 119 AM PDT Mon Oct 2 2023

Near normal temperatures Monday will warm to above normal
Wednesday through Friday as strong high pressure builds over the
state producing periods of mainly light offshore winds. Wednesday
and Thursday look to be the hottest days but nights will still be
cool bringing relief from daytime heat. Fire weather concerns will
increase through the week due to hot temperatures, lowering
humidity and periods of dry offshore winds. The ridge begins to
weaken next weekend with the next trough forecast to arrive around
Columbus Day.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 119 AM PDT Mon Oct 2 2023

Upper low that brought some showers and cooler temps over the
weekend is now over the Great Basin and losing its influence over
the region. Early morning satellite shows patchy stratus from Pt
Reyes southward to Santa Cruz but not really pushing inland more
than a few miles. Farther south there are some patchy clouds in
the valleys and coastline of the Central Coast but coverage
remains sparse overall. Dry northerly flow aloft on the backside
of the low is slowly ushering a drier airmass over the region and
keeping cloud coverage to a minimum.

Any morning clouds should mix out quickly after sunrise as high
pressure slowly begins to build and drive the synoptic weather
pattern. Look for chamber of commerce weather to start the work
week with plenty of sunshine and afternoon highs into the 70s for
most of the region. Mostly clear skies tonight as dry northerly
flow aloft continues with little or no marine layer influence.

.LONG TERM...
(Tuesday through Sunday)
Issued at 119 AM PDT Mon Oct 2 2023

Highly amplified longwave pattern will feature a 590 dm ridge
offshore with a trough over the Rockies and the Bay Area in-
between. That means large scale subsidence with a warming airmass
aloft and developing northerly offshore winds Tuesday afternoon
into Weds. The best surface pressure gradient stays focused over
far Northern California and at this time expecting a light to
moderate offshore wind event that will stay focused over the
highest ridges of the North Bay Tuesday night into Weds. The main
impact will be to allow continued warming and drying of the
boundary layer and a favorable downslope warming wind for the
valleys of the North and East Bay Weds and Thursday when daytime
highs will soar into the upper 80s to mid 90s. The NBM probability
scenarios and EFI (extreme forecast index) suggest the areas that
could be warmer then forecast are those locations around SF Bay
and along the coast that are often more strongly influence by a
cool marine layer. Under this pattern, persistent light northeast
to east flow will bring a more isothermal temperature regime
across the Bay Area where afternoon highs wont vary much from the
coastal beaches to the inland valleys.

The pattern is a pretty classic fall offshore wind setup but none
of the variables looks especially strong. Again the EFI index
shows no values of note for strong winds and the only unusual
event being warmer temps at the beaches this week. As always we
are monitoring closely for fire weather concerns but things dont
seem to be lining up for critical conditions. Tuesday night in the
Napa hills winds peak in the 20-25 range but RH values remain
pretty moist above 40%. By Weds night into Thursday persistent
light northeast/offshore winds continue but generally under 10 mph
even though RH values lower to less than 30%. Again, nothing
extraordinary. The main impact will be the hotter afternoon temps
Weds through Friday and possibly into Saturday though by that
point the ridge will be weakening and there will be no offshore
winds of note with neutral or slightly onshore gradients.

Cooling trend by Sunday ahead of the next trough that approaches
by next Monday with increasing onshore winds and possible precip
to our north. Early indications show this weeks heat should be
fairly short lived with long range cluster analysis and ensemble
members suggesting zonal or slightly cyclonic flow by mid-month.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 437 AM PDT Mon Oct 2 2023

IFR-LIFR stratus developing at the immediate coast, with a finger
extending into the Salinas Valley. Monitoring a patch of stratus in
the Berkeley area for potential impacts to OAK, SFO, and APC. In
addition, continuing to monitor chances for fog at STS, which model
output is not capturing well, but is still possible given calm winds
and clear skies at present. Any stratus that does impact the
terminals should clear out by 17-18Z. Calm to light winds through
the morning, building to a breezy onshore flow at up to 10-15 knots
this afternoon. Some stratus development in the North Bay and
Monterey Bay regions this evening, with low confidence for stratus
impacts to the main SF Bay terminals at this time.

Vicinity of SFO... Model output continues to suggest that the
terminal and approach path will remain at VFR, despite potential
stratus development near OAK and the eastern shore of the SF Bay.
Current SFO-ACV and SFO-SAC gradients do not support advection of
stratus from the western side of the San Mateo Peninsula. For now
have kept SFO VFR through the TAF period, but will continue to
monitor. Light northwest flow continues through the morning, then
northwest winds at 10-15 knots until the evening. High clouds
building late on Monday evening but stratus impacts are not
expected at SFO at this time. A low confidence (10-20%
probability) of stratus impacts at OAK.

SFO Bridge Approach... Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals... IFR-LIFR stratus expected through 17Z.
Light drainage winds continue until northwest flow builds in the
afternoon at up to 10 knots. Stratus expected to return this evening
although with some uncertainty on ceiling heights and exact
timing.

.MARINE...
(Today through Saturday)
Issued at 437 AM PDT Mon Oct 2 2023

Northwesterly winds diminishing as high pressure develops, with
fresh winds becoming moderate. Wave heights continue to decrease
through the week as winds ease, creating more favorable
conditions. Moderate period (12-14 seconds) southerly swell
persists through the week, alongside shorter period northwesterly
swell (8-10 seconds). New, longer - period northwesterly swell
moves in towards the middle of the work week.
