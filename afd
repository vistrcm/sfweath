...New SHORT TERM...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 335 AM PDT Mon Jun 23 2025

Quiet and seasonable weather is expected this week. Look for the
stratus to settle in at night with the marine layer deepening and
then mixing out for inland areas each afternoon. Minor coastal
flooding is also expected each evening through Thursday along the
San Francisco Bay.

.SHORT TERM...
(This afternoon through Tuesday)
Issued at 915 AM PDT Mon Jun 23 2025

No planned forecast updates this morning. The marine layer has
deepened to around 1500 feet this morning, likely in response to
the trough centered over Bakersfield that is generating some mid
level clouds over the Southern Sierra at this time. Low stratus is
hugging the coastline and only pushing a few miles inland other
than down the Salinas Valley where the daily retreat is underway.
Full sunshine inland today but with no real hot temps forecast for
late June as temps will barely reach 90 for the interior valleys
while pleasant 70s prevail around the Bay. Will note that the
visible satellite does show a band of high level smoke that is
emanating from Canadian wildfires and may allow for some brilliant
red skies closer to sunset. Quiet June pattern to continue this
week with a general trough over the West Coast through midweek
keeping onshore winds and near to below normal temps in place,
even inland. Pattern trends more zonal by late week but no big
changes of note forecast. Sea surface temps are now running colder
than normal near shore after several days of strong nw winds. SF
buoy 26 and Monterey Bay buoy both reporting SST of 50 degrees,
thus continued onshore wind pattern will ensure cool temps near
the coast with efficient stratus production night and morning
hours. Long range trends out through July 4th time frame suggest a
general trough over the Pacific NW with no sign of hot summer
weather pattern attm.

.LONG TERM...
(Tuesday through Sunday)
Issued at 335 AM PDT Mon Jun 23 2025

Little to no change to the extended forecast as upper level
troughing eventually gives way to quasi-zonal flow. This will lead to
cloudy nights with the stratus attempting to surge inland each time.
Any interior clouds are expected to mix out by the afternoon, giving
way sunny skies. Onshore flow continues, with the traditional gusty
afternoon and early evening hours. Temperatures will gradually warm
through the week and into the weekend, especially for interior
locations.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 442 AM PDT Mon Jun 23 2025

Currently a mixed bag of LIFR-VFR at the terminals. The marine layer
is being observed at 1,000 feet on the Fort Ord profiler and will
likely deepen with the help of a second upper-level shortwave
trough, resulting in more sub-VFR ceilings tonight. High confidence
in VFR prevailing by the afternoon, although stratus will stick to
the coastline and return tonight. Onshore winds will prevail through
the TAF period.

Vicinity of SFO...Currently VFR with westerly flow. High confidence
in VFR prevailing until tonight. Westerly winds will prevail through
the TAF period.

SFO Bridge Approach...Low stratus clouds will filter into the San
Mateo Bridge Approach by 03Z.

Monterey Bay Terminals...Currently IFR and calm at MRY and LIFR with
westerly flow at SNS. High confidence in VFR by the afternoon with
LIFR/IFR ceilings returning to the terminals this evening. Westerly
winds will prevail through the TAF period.

.MARINE...
(Today through Saturday)
Issued at 442 AM PDT Mon Jun 23 2025

Fresh to strong northwesterly breezes will prevail through the
week. Seas will ebb and flow between moderate and rough through
the week.
