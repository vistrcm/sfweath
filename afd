...New SHORT TERM, LONG TERM, AVIATION, MARINE...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 130 PM PDT Fri Jun 16 2023

Slight inland warming to near normal today. Onshore winds
increase into early next week with another round of marine stratus
and cooler temperatures. Cool temperatures persist into next week
with troughing along the West Coast.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 350 AM PDT Sat Jun 17 2023

Some limited marine layer compression evident via profiler data
this morning under a weak ridge situated over the region today.
Pockets of drizzle likely along coastal areas through this
morning. Ample clear skies inland with high temps near normal this
afternoon, slightly below normal along the coast. Influence of a
deep upper low moving down from the PacNW begins late tonight as
winds become breezy in response to tightening pressure gradient.

&&

.LONG TERM...
(Sunday through Friday)
Issued at 350 AM PDT Sat Jun 17 2023

Sunday marks the first in a series of cooler days under the
influence of the deep upper low. Windy conditions continue Sunday
morning into late Monday with locally gusty conditions along
coastal areas and inland ridgetops. The low continues to be in a
favorable place for wind direction to be onshore, so not expecting
any critical minimum RH values during the afternoons. Even so,
still expect a deep marine layer through the event with recoveries
> 70%. Gradual warm up through midweek, though temperatures remain
below normal. Overall long term pattern continues to favor near-
to-below normal temps. No heat waves to speak of on the horizon.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 350 AM PDT Sat Jun 17 2023

Widespread, generally IFR stratus, blankets the area except the most
interior valleys and the higher elevations. Stratus continues to
expand through the night before starting to burn off around 15-17Z.
Strong westerly wind flow will develop this afternoon with sustained
wind speeds from 10-18 knots. With a trough approaching the region,
not expecting widespread stratus development in the Bay Area this
evening. The Central Coast will see more stratus development until
early Sunday morning. Beyond the TAF period, a dry cold front will
approach bringing strong northwesterly winds with gusts up to 25-35
knots.

Vicinity of SFO...IFR stratus persists through around 16-17Z. A
strong westerly wind will develop this afternoon with gusts up to 25-
30 knots. Although no significant stratus development is currently
expected this evening, strong gusts will continue through the
overnight hours and the approaching cold front will increase gusts
on Sunday morning. Beyond the TAF period, monitoring the potential
for gusts exceeding 35 knots.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...IFR stratus persists through the morning
with a late burnoff around 21Z. Confidence is increasing in at least
a temporary clearing to VFR at MRY around this time, with an early
return of IFR stratus around 2-3Z. Northwesterly winds develop this
afternoon with gusts peaking around 10-15 knots. Moderate confidence
that the approaching trough will help thin out the cloud layers
early Sunday morning, but probability of a full clearing to VFR is
around 30%.

&&

.MARINE...
(Today through Thursday)
Issued at 350 AM PDT Sat Jun 17 2023

Northwesterly winds building across the waters through the day and
persist into Tuesday. Windiest spots will be between Point Arena
and Point Reyes, as well as south of Point Sur, where occasional
gale force gusts will be possible. Strong winds on Sunday and
Monday will result in hazardous conditions for all waters. In
addition, afternoon and evening gusty winds are forecast each day
across the San Francisco Bay mainly north of the Bay Bridge to the
Delta. Seas remain a mix of long period southerly swell with a
shorter period northwesterly swell.
