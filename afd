.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 227 AM PST Sun Dec 3 2023

Cool, unsettled weather for Sunday followed by a short-lived
warm-up early in the week. An approaching trough of low pressure
towards the middle of the upcoming week will bring the return of
unsettled weather.

&&

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 227 AM PST Sun Dec 3 2023

Lingering light rain showers persist over the North Bay and San
Francisco Bay Area this morning. Expecting the focus to shift
northward throughout the day as a ridge of high pressure begins to
build into the Central Coast.

Another cool afternoon is in store with temperatures struggle to
warm much beyond the mid 60s across the interior, upper 50s
elsewhere and lower 50s in the highest peaks. Tonight, look for
temperatures to cool into the lower 50s in the hills and around
the San Francisco Bay Shoreline to the mid 40s elsewhere.

.LONG TERM...
(Monday through Saturday)
Issued at 227 AM PST Sun Dec 3 2023

Expecting a warming and drying trend as we move into the upcoming
week. On Monday the interior is expected to reach the lower 70s
and mid 70s by Tuesday. This warm up will be short-lived as the
next mid/upper level trough approaches the West Coast and dips
down into the North Bay by Tuesday night. Across the Central
Coast, will hold on to one more warm day as the interior once
again warms into the lower 70s on Wednesday.

Rain chances increase across the North Bay and San Francisco Bay
Area Tuesday night and sweeps southward across the region.
However, this front is likely to "wash-out" on Wednesday with
minimal rainfall over the Central Coast. Cool, unsettled
conditions will persist into Friday.

Once the precipitation tapers off on Friday the focus then turns
to overnight lows. Longer range guidance suggests another round of
chilly to cold night with frost/freeze conditions possible.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 349 AM PST Sun Dec 3 2023

Active weather continues across NorCal and the Pacific NW,
resulting in westerly flow and moist conditions to the Bay Area
and Central Coast. Currently there are a mix of VFR and localized
LIFR conditions near KAPC and the Monterey Bay region. Hi-res
guidance indicates an increased probability of lowered cigs for
KSTS and KOAK terminals after 12z-13z this morning. Lower cigs
that do develop will scatter out between 16z-17z but lingering
longer potentially at KOAK. VFR with high clouds expected this
afternoon. Surface winds this afternoon will be onshore and
generally under 10 knots. Low clouds return tonight into Monday
morning with HREF advertising a stronger signal for low clouds
after 12z Monday.

Vicinity of SFO...VFR currently but guidance signaling at MVFR
cigs developing at OAK after 13z lingering through at least 19z.
Models in good agreement that low clouds will stay out of SFO
terminal space, increasing confidence that VFR will persist
through the morning hours. NW winds will increase through the
afternoon. Low clouds return between 10z-15z early Monday morning
but confidence for MVFR cig development at SFO is lower compared
to OAK.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO. Low clouds will likely
develop across the eastern portion of the SF Bay first near the
East Bay early Monday.

Monterey Bay Terminals...LIFR conditions at KWVI and KSNS will
persist through at least 15z with vis improving after 15z. IFR-
MVFR expected through at least 17z, however. KMRY remains VFR, but
slight chance for lowered cigs to develop through 16z, but
confidence is low to moderate. Winds will become onshore by the
afternoon. HREF and MOS guidance both indicate an increased
probability for low cigs to develop briefly around 01-04z, but
confidence is low currently. SCT low clouds included in TAFs for
now to hint at this possibility.

.MARINE...
(Today through Friday)
Issued at 227 AM PST Sun Dec 3 2023

Across the northern waters north of the Golden Gate, gentle to
moderate southwesterly winds will continue through midweek as
active weather continues across the Pacific Northwest. Moderate
period northwest swell at 8 to 11 feet will persist into Monday. A
series of long period northwest swells will propagate through the
coastal waters starting Monday afternoon. As these swells build,
elevated seas are expected to prevail for much of the upcoming
week, resulting in hazardous conditions for small craft operators.

&&

.MTR WATCHES/WARNINGS/ADVISORIES...
CA...None.
PZ...Small Craft Advisory until 9 PM PST Monday for Pt Arena to Pt
     Reyes 10-60 NM.

     Small Craft Advisory until 3 PM PST this afternoon for Pigeon Pt
     to Pt Pinos 10-60 NM.
