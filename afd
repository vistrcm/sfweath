...New AVIATION, MARINE...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 151 AM PST Tue Jan 16 2024

Locally foggy conditions this morning otherwise light rain
developing today into Wednesday morning. Better rain chances this
weekend into the beginning of next week.

&&

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 227 AM PST Tue Jan 16 2024

Closely monitoring fog including dense fog development this
morning although so far it remains patchy and mainly confined to
the North Bay valleys. Napa Airport briefly had dense fog since
midnight, however an increase in surface winds has since helped
lift the fog to a low cloud ceiling; surface observations over the
Delta to the immediate Central Valley similarly show low ceilings
vs fog or dense fog. A rapidly advancing upper level jet stream
and associated convergence/divergence couplet will pass across the
forecast area this morning, but perhaps more importantly, rapidly
increasing mid level precipitable waters (increasing water vapor)
through mid to late morning will rapidly decrease radiative
cooling to space; the combination of dynamic, radiative properties
including periodically greater mixing surface winds described may
be sufficient to preclude additional dense fog from developing this
morning, that would be good news for the upcoming morning commute.

Otherwise warm air advection rain develops from north to south today
followed by a cool frontal passage tonight. Expect breezy to locally
gusty winds along with rain tonight and Wednesday morning.

.LONG TERM...
(Wednesday through Monday)
Issued at 227 AM PST Tue Jan 16 2024

Showers ending Wednesday morning otherwise drier until Friday and
the weekend. Plan on wet weather this weekend especially on Sunday
when the polar/subtropical jet stream pushes a low pressure system
through to the east. Showers lingering mainly Monday morning.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 327 AM PST Tue Jan 16 2024

Fog in the North Bay and East Bay has caused a mix of VFR, IFR, and
LIFR conditions across the region. Expect a late morning clearing
for any terminals that is experiencing low vis and low ceilings.
Winds will remain light to moderate through most of the TAF
period. Following a mix of persistence and model forecast, expect
ceilings start to lower to MVFR as the low pressure system pushes
some showers over the terminals this evening, followed by possible
IFR to LIFR conditions. North Bay is expected to see low
visibility and fog Wednesday morning, but confidence is moderate,
as the fog development is contingent on post frontal environment.

Vicinity of SFO...VFR conditions prevail with chances of MVFR-IFR
conditions tomorrow afternoon/evening as pre-frontal rain enters the
region. E/SE winds are expected to remain moderate through the TAF
period with chances of wind speeds increasing to 10-12 knots as
showers move closer to the terminals.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...VFR conditions continue. KSNS may
experience MVFR conditions until 18z, but had low confidence to
include in TAFs. Expect MVFR to IFR conditions as showers move
closer to the terminals. Winds will remain light to moderate through
the TAF period with KSNS seeing relatively stronger winds up to 10
knots near the afternoon.

&&

.MARINE...
(Today through Sunday)
Issued at 327 AM PST Tue Jan 16 2024

A cold front will enter over the waters mid-day Tuesday causing
relatively minor impacts, with strong southerly winds in the NW
waters and moderate winds elsewhere. Scattered showers will also
accompany the frontal passage, mostly late Tuesday afternoon. By
Wednesday, widespread favorable conditions will return with light
winds and moderate westerly swell. A series of stronger systems is
in store beginning Friday. As a result, most marine zones are
expected to receive strong southerly winds and rough seas starting
Friday and persisting through the weekend.

.MTR WATCHES/WARNINGS/ADVISORIES...
CA...None.
PZ...Small Craft Advisory from 9 AM this morning to 3 PM PST this
     afternoon for Pt Arena to Pt Reyes 10-60 NM.
