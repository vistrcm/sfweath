.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 134 AM PDT Fri Aug 2 2024

Continued warmer than normal across the interior through the
forecast period. Slight chance for dry lightning Friday evening.

&&

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 134 AM PDT Fri Aug 2 2024

Currently beginning to see signs of the moisture plume moving into
southern and central CA this morning. Radar showing some returns
over the southern end of the San Joaquin Valley and the Sierra.
These showers and thunderstorms resulted in numerous lightning
strikes and some flooding in interior portions of southern
California last night. However, once the moisture makes it further
north, it will have a harder time battling the layer of dry air
just underneath. Short range guidance has shown a slightly higher
likelihood of seeing some activity over our area than previously
advertised, although the overall probability is still low. Looking
at hi-res cross sections, there is quite a bit of moisture aloft,
enough to erode the dry layer a bit, and perhaps even enough to
get some sprinkles here and there. However, any showers that do
form will still have some work to do to moisten the dry layer in
hopes of getting anything meaningful to the ground. Once again,
the best chances of seeing any thunderstorm activity will be over
our eastern zones bordering the Central Valley, beginning about
5 PM and lasting into the early morning hours Saturday.

.LONG TERM...
(Saturday through Thursday)
Issued at 134 AM PDT Fri Aug 2 2024

The dry lightning threat will end from south to north through
Saturday morning, and will have moved away from our area by
midday.

From previous...
Temperatures will hold roughly 5 degrees above normal through the
forecast period. In fact, there has been a slight improvement
through the weekend, with ECMWF ENS 850 temp run-to-run decreasing
by around 1C over the last couple updates. This is likely in
response to increased cloud cover from the moisture plume. Areas
in the interior East Bay, South Bay, and interior Central Coast
will begin to see moderate HeatRisk by early next week, not
necessarily due to the magnitude of the heat, but rather many
consecutive days above normal. With the risk of heat-related
impacts remaining limited and the trend improving, we are still
holding off on the issuance of any hazards.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 425 AM PDT Fri Aug 2 2024

IFR-LIFR ceilings are being reported at the immediate coast, across
the North bay valleys, the East bayshore, the Monterey Bay area and
the Salinas Valley. High clouds across the region are once again
impacting the stratus development, with decreased confidence for
stratus impacts at SFO and SJC. Stratus should mix out later this
morning as breezy onshore flow develops, with a very low confidence
of virga and scattered thundershowers passing through the region
from south to north through the afternoon and evening. Inland
stratus development this evening into Saturday morning is not
expected to be as extensive as the last couple of days.

Vicinity of SFO... Stratus has so far stayed away from the terminal,
lowering confidence in earlier forecasts of stratus development.
Updated model guidance suggests that the terminal remains clear
overnight, but have retained a TEMPO for IFR ceilings as terminal
cameras show stratus remaining in the area. West-northwest winds up
to 20 knots will develop in the afternoon. Low confidence for virga
and scattered showers this evening, and for stratus to impact the
terminal then through the end of the TAF period.

SFO Bridge Approach... Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals... LIFR stratus and patchy fog through the
late morning. Breezy onshore winds in the afternoon accompanied by a
low confidence of virga and scattered showers. Stratus expected to
return this evening through the end of the TAF period.

.MARINE...
(Today through Wednesday)
Issued at 425 AM PDT Fri Aug 2 2024

The gradient between subtropical high pressure and lower pressure
over California supports a moderate northwesterly breeze and
moderate sea heights. This pressure gradient will tighten over the
weekend, increasing winds to a fresh breeze and building sea
heights to 8 feet. While not forecast to be of direct impact to
our area, Tropical Storm Carlotta, along with two other
disturbances, are churning in the Eastern Pacific. We will
continue to monitor the tropics to see if any significant
southerly swell is on the way.
