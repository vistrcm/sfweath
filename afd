...New AVIATION...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 1243 AM PDT Fri May 19 2023

Morning clouds and cool temperatures will prevail along the coast
with a robust marine layer. High pressure will bring warm
temperatures to inland areas through mid week, with slight cooling
expected thereafter. Breezy winds at times for the coastal waters
and along the coastal interface.

&&

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 1243 AM PDT Fri May 19 2023

A stout upper anticyclone will center near Lake Tahoe as upper
troughing locates along the Pacific Northwest coast. The trough will
be maintained by an upper level low over the Gulf of Alaska. Surface
high pressure will center west of CA, with this pattern resulting in
onshore flow and maintaining a marine layer along with
overnight/morning coastal clouds, patchy fog, and perhaps some
drizzle. By Friday afternoon look for clearing towards the coast
along with inland temperatures rising into the 70s and 80s.
Meanwhile the marine layer`s influence will keep temperatures along
the coast and bays in the 60s. Lows tonight will be seasonal and
generally in the lower to mid 50s.

&&

.LONG TERM...
(Saturday through Thursday)
Issued at 1243 AM PDT Fri May 19 2023

The upper ridge will initially remain prominent across the area on
Saturday, but will weaken thereafter in response to upper troughing
moving onshore across the Pacific Northwest. A strong surface high
pressure area will center offshore from the west coast early in the
period before weakening by late week. The resultant pressure
gradient will bring breezy conditions to the local waters and
coastal interface, but otherwise look for a similar pattern day-by-
day, outside of some small cooling by late week as troughing
develops closer to the area. But outside of occasional breeziness and
the typical marine layer coastal clouds, not really looking for much
in the way of sensible weather on the horizon.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 429 AM PDT Fri May 19 2023

IFR CIGs along the coast and into the bays. Winds stay light to
moderate through much of the morning. Patches of fog look to form
along the coast and parts of the Monterey Bay as well as portions
of the North Bay. Cloud cover thins into the late morning,
followed by an afternoon with moderate westerly winds for most
areas. Expect winds to reduce into Friday night with IFR CIGs
building along the bays and the coast later that night.

Vicinity of SFO...IFR CIGs build into the late night and last into
the late morning. VFR returns Friday afternoon with gusty westerly
winds peaking around 20 kts with 28 kts. These winds weaken into the
late night with IFR CIGs filling over the SF Bay.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.


Monterey Bay Terminals...IFR/LIFR with moments of fog last through
the late morning. Expect light to moderate winds through the

.MARINE...
(Today through Tuesday)
Issued at 202 PM PDT Thu May 18 2023

Breezy to gusty northwesterly winds will continue across the
coastal waters and bays through the weekend and into early next
week. Occasional gusts up to gale force will are also expected in
the favored coastal jet regions. These winds will result steep
wind waves through the weekend. In addition, a long period
southerly swell of 3 to 5 feet at 18 seconds continues to move
through the waters and will slowly decay into the weekend.
