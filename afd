.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 200 AM PDT Sun Jul 16 2023

Excessive heat remains a concern through this evening as inland
temperatures reach the 90s to around 110. Overnight cooling will
be limited with a moderate to high HeatRisk. There is a low
potential for isolated thunderstorms this evening into early
Monday morning with dry lightning as the primary concern.
Confidence in this scenario is low so keep up with forecast
updates.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today through Monday)
Issued at 1219 AM PDT Sun Jul 16 2023

Key Messages:
* Dangerous heat today with highs in the 90s to 110 inland
* Limited overnight cooling in the hills with lows of 75 to 85
* Excessive Heat Warning inland areas through this evening
* Small chance for dry lightning tonight into Monday morning

Technical Discussion:
An elongated upper ridge extended from the Bay Area into
northwest Arizona early this morning. Upper level wind analysis
suggests the upper high center has shifted towards Arizona with
central CA now locating along the western ridge periphery.
Moisture channel imagery reveals return flow along the western
ridge extent with high clouds pushing north through the Channel
Islands. The total blended precipitable water (PW) satellite
product suggests these clouds are locating along the leading edge
of a moisture gradient, with PW values increasing to 0.8-1.0
inches across far SW CA and the adjacent coastal waters. This
moisture push was co-located with a shortwave perturbation evident
on water vapor imagery rotating northwest from northern Baja
towards the waters offshore from SW CA. This moisture/instability
push will set the stage for a pattern change which should arrive
later tonight into Monday. But first let`s talk about the primary
concern for today which is heat.

Our area remains on the western fringes of a strong high pressure
ridge aloft. Given the shallow and compressed marine layer readings
early this morning are quite warm in the hills. In fact for
elevations of 2,000+ feet current temperatures are largely in the
mid to upper 80s. Even the inland valleys are particularly warm given
the hour with readings in the 70s. So from this starting point it
really won`t take much to get skyrocketing readings this afternoon
as interior temperatures reach into the 90s to around 110. One
limiting factor for further heating may be the late day increase in
mid to high level clouds occuring along the leading edge of the
upper moisture gradient, but even that shouldn`t temper things too
much. And while it will be warm inland look for a different story
along the coast and bays. The combination of onshore flow and a
persistent and compressed marine layer should keep the "natural AC"
in full effect for these areas. After another morning of low stratus
and fog (potentially dense around Monterey Bay), look for a gradual
clearing towards the coast during the late morning hours. However
even though the clouds have cleared the marine airmass should
prevail keeping highs at places like Monterey and Ocean Beach in the
60s. Meanwhile the near-coastal valleys and areas slightly removed
from the strongest marine layer influences (think the Salinas
Valley, Oakland area, and inland portions of Santa Cruz) will see
temperatures climbing into the 70s to lower 80s for today.

By late this afternoon a focused plume of high-level moisture (PWs
around 0.8-1.2 inches) will advect north along the Central Coast
before reaching the Bay Area this evening. This moisture transport
will occur in concert with a shortwave impulse riding the southerly
steering flow into the region. This impulse should provide both
elevated instability and at least modest forcing for ascent during
the Sunday evening to early Monday morning time frame. Proximity
soundings show elevated instability will exist with very dry low
levels. This suggests a conditional risk for high-based thunderstorm
development, with a primary focus over the North Bay. And while the
precipitable water values point towards a mixed wet-dry thunderstorm
regime, the very dry low levels suggest a concern for dry lightning,
should thunderstorms develop. This remains a low confidence yet
potentially high impact scenario. Confidence in thunderstorm
development is only 10-15 percent at this time. Ultimately the
details are best refined at the mesoscale level later today so stay
tuned for forecast updates.

Otherwise Monday will feature more cloud cover, stronger onshore
flow, and slightly cooler temperatures. Highs will range from the
mid 90s to lower 100s for the typically warm spots (North Bay
Valleys, East Bay, and southern Monterey and San Benito Counties),
with 70s and 80s for most other inland areas, with 60s and 70s near
the coast and bays.

.LONG TERM...
(Tuesday through Saturday)
Issued at 200 AM PDT Sun Jul 16 2023

A shortwave trough will progress from the Pacific Northwest along
the International Border with quasi-zonal flow developing
thereafter. This will further erode the northern periphery of the
upper level ridge which will shift more towards the southern Great
Plains. This should bring a gradual cooling trend to the region
through late week as the marine layer deepens and expands farther
inland during the overnight and morning hours.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 448 AM PDT Sun Jul 16 2023

Mostly VFR throughout the region except Monterey Bay terminals. Fog
and low clouds continues to remain socked in over the terminals, but
any terminals with stratus is expected to clear to VFR near 17Z as
diurnal heating takes into effect. High confidence that most
terminals will continue to experience VFR (except Monterey Bay). The
marine layer still sits between 350-900 feet and is fairly
compressed. Therefore, due to persistence, there is a possibility
of IFR CIGs in the North Bay late tonight, but had very low
confidence to include in the TAFs. Onshore winds will be come
breezy in the afternoon up to 14 knots with gusty winds especially
near coastal gaps. Winds are expected to become light to moderate
in the evening and throughout the night.

Vicinity of SFO...High confidence that VFR will prevail through the
TAF period. High clouds will pass over the terminals with onshore
winds becoming gusty near 21Z. Although low confidence that ceilings
will develop over the terminal, IFR ceilings will linger near the
coast.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...LIFR with possibility that ceilings will
lower even further. Therefore, tempo was placed in the TAFs with a
clearing time near 17Z. Expect stratus to return late tonight but
low to moderate confidence on ceiling height. Some models suggest
between IFR and LIFR, but due to persistence and compressed marine
layer expect LIFR conditions tonight.

.MARINE...
(Today through Friday)
Issued at 235 AM PDT Sun Jul 16 2023

Strong and gusty northwest winds persisting across the waters
through next week, with gale force gusts developing Sunday across
the northern outer waters. Breezy winds developing across the San
Francisco Bay into the Delta each afternoon. Steep wind waves
dominate, creating hazardous conditions for small craft, with a
light southerly swell in the background.

&&

.FIRE WEATHER...
Issued at 845 AM PDT Sat Jul 15 2023

Triple digit heat across the interior combined with daytime
minimum humidity readings in the upper single digits to teens will
help to dry out any moisture in the finer fuels. Weak to moderate
onshore flow will also persist leading to some breezy afternoon
winds in the valleys, gaps, and passes. Therefore, hot, dry, and
breezy conditions will lead to elevated fire weather concerns
through the weekend. Overnight recovery will be greatest below
1,000 feet through the weekend as night/morning clouds will be
possible. Above the marine layer will see little to no overnight
recovery with active thermal belts (mild and dry conditions).
With elevated fire weather concerns fuels will be more receptive
to new starts and could easily spread in the finer fuels. The
downward trend noted on the 100 hour fuels charts will continue
through early next week at a minimum given the current weather
pattern. Additionally, the forecasted ERC charts show the the Bay
Area will reach the 90th percentile as well.

Finally, one additional fire weather concern we`re monitoring
closely will be high based convection Sunday in Monday. While the
confidence is low at this point the impact could be high following
this round of triple digit heat. Confidence is about 10-15% for
convection Sunday night into Monterey. Stay tuned...
