...New AVIATION, MARINE...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 210 AM PDT Fri Sep 1 2023

Low pressure sliding down the coast from the Pacific Northwest
will bring continued cooling into the weekend. This system will
also bring drizzle to the region with possible light rain in North
Bay. As we move into meteorological fall today, it will actually
feel like autumn. A slight warming trend will occur during the
first half of next week.

&&

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 210 AM PDT Fri Sep 1 2023

Upper troughing deepens along the West Coast as an accompanying cold
front continues its southward progression through the Bay Area and
Central Coast. Initially breezy W-SW winds this morning will shift
from the W-NW this afternoon while decreasing in the post-frontal
environment. Area profilers place the marine layer depth at 1,500 to
2,000+ feet along the coast, with some inland disruption occurring
as the cold front passes through. Regardless the depth appears
sufficient for a little drizzle in the favorable spots this morning.
Thereafter we`ll see small chances for instability showers this
afternoon and tonight as lapse rates steepen with the upper trough
overhead. No big rain expected, but we could see enough
precipitation to wet the ground in a few places. Temperatures will
be rather cool in the post-frontal cold advection regime with highs
mostly in the 60s and 70s. A few of the warmest spots in inland
Monterey and southern San Benito Counties may reach 80. Lows tonight
should be mostly in the 50s with a few lower 60s for the warmest
areas around San Francisco Bay.

.LONG TERM...
(Saturday through Thursday)
Issued at 210 AM PDT Fri Sep 1 2023

The upper trough will evolve to a closed low this weekend. The low
will pinwheel about NorCal before rejoining the westerlies and
departing early next week. Quasi-zonal flow should establish in its
wake by mid week. The nearby low should provide an uptick in clouds
and light precipitation potential this weekend, with the greatest
probability for measurable rainfall well to our north. Precipitation
isn`t totally out of the question locally but is more likely to be
in the form of drizzle if realized. Initially cool temperatures this
weekend will undergo a gradual warm-up by mid week.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 456 AM PDT Fri Sep 1 2023

Current satellite imagery shows stratus enveloping much of Monterey
Bay and the Salinas valley, as well as the SF bay area, into the
east bay hills, and Sonoma and Solano counties. With a deepened
marine layer and moderate onshore winds, stratus has pushed deep
inland, is expected to linger through at least the late morning, if
not the early afternoon. Current MVFR-IFR CIGs are expected to lift
and clear to VFR towards the same late morning to early afternoon
timeframe as mentioned previously. In short - generally late
clearing of stratus from terminals.

Winds onshore with a slight southerly component making them more
W/SW expected through the day today, becoming moderate and gusty
into the late afternoon. Stratus returns in the early evening to
reintroduce MVFR conditions once again for most terminals.

Vicinity of SFO...MVFR CIGs last through the early afternoon, with
moderate confidence in clearing to VFR for a brief window of time
before stratus surrounds the terminal again in the early evening.
Models continue to hint at no clearing over the SF bay terminals
today, so this will be something to keep a close eye on. However,
greatest confidence at this time is in a short clearing window
towards 21Z. Winds W/SW gusting up to 20 knots this afternoon, then
weakening into the night.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...IFR-MVFR continues through the late morning
for KSNS to afternoon for KMRY, then clearing briefly to VFR. Again,
models suggest no clearing of stratus at KMRY, similar to KSFO.
Though, thought process at this time is that clearing to VFR will
be very brief, only around two hours in the afternoon near 21Z,
then returning to MVFR-IFR as stratus pushes in once more. Winds
onshore around 10-14 knots this afternoon.

&&

.MARINE...
(Today through Wednesday)
Issued at 456 AM PDT Fri Sep 1 2023

Breezy to gusty northerly winds have begun to diminish over much
of the coastal waters, and are expected to continue to ease
through the day Friday with an improving sea state. Winds
generally W/NW and gentle to moderate through the weekend. A mix
of moderate period (10-12 seconds) light northerly and southerly
swell persists, with new, longer period northerly and southerly
swell trains arriving towards the beginning of the work week next
week.

.MTR WATCHES/WARNINGS/ADVISORIES...
CA...None.
PZ...Small Craft Advisory until 9 AM PDT this morning for PZZ530-540-
     570.
