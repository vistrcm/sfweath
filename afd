.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 155 AM PST Sat Dec 23 2023

Dry conditions and seasonal temperatures continue through Christmas
Day. Next rain system arrives late on Tuesday with a series of
low pressure systems into the New Year.

&&

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 155 AM PST Sat Dec 23 2023

Generally light winds through the rest of the night with patchy fog
and stratus observed on satellite. Best chances for fog tonight lie
across the East Bay, South Bay, the Monterey Bay region, and the
interior Central Coast. Morning lows will drop to the mid 30s to
lower 40s in the interior valleys and mid 40s to lower 50s across
the coastal region.

Light and generally onshore winds will continue through the day,
with mostly clear skies and temperatures at or slightly above
seasonal averages. Highs will hover around 60 in the lower
elevations and drop into the low to mid 50s in the higher
elevations. Lows for Saturday night into Sunday morning will be
somewhat chillier, with the most pronounced decreases across the
interior regions. However, any chances for frost should be limited
to the highest elevations.

.LONG TERM...
(Sunday through Friday)
Issued at 155 AM PST Sat Dec 23 2023

Drier conditions continue through Christmas Day with partly cloudy
skies and highs in the low to mid 60s in the lower elevations, and
the low to mid 50s in the higher elevations. A few sprinkles are
possible in the North Bay on Christmas Day, with the highest
probabilities for rain up to 40-50% in the coastal ranges. Southerly
winds are expected to become rather gusty through the day on
Tuesday, associated with the approach of a frontal system centered
in the Gulf of Alaska, with primary impacts to the Pacific Northwest
and British Columbia. The next widespread rain system arrives later
on Tuesday, with models currently targeting Wednesday for the most
intense rainfall before a lull begins on Thursday. Rainfall totals
from late Tuesday to late Thursday top out at  2-2.5" in the North
Bay mountains, with 1-1.5" across the North Bay valleys and the
Santa Cruz and Santa Lucia mountain ranges. The Bay Area and
Monterey Bay region look set to receive up to 0.3-1" of rain, while
interior regions of the Central coast should expect up to 0.25" of
rain.

A new system approaches the region towards the end of next week,
with ensemble model output showing a series of low pressure systems
coming into the western part of North America into the first week of
January. Of the main ensemble models, the European model keeps the
low pressure centers further north towards the Gulf of Alaska, while
the American GEFS shows some of the low pressure centers heading
closer to the contiguous 48 states. Updated CPC guidance shows that
it`s more likely than not that precipitation totals in our region
continue to remain above seasonal averages into the middle part of
January. As with long term guidance, the intensity, amount, and
exact timing of precipitation remains unclear. In the meantime, it
is always prudent to make sure gutters and storm drains are clear of
debris, and to continue to follow forecast updates from trusted
sources.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 342 AM PST Sat Dec 23 2023

Patchy fog persists near KAPC and KDVO where LIFR conditions
currently prevail. While fog is not as expansive as the previous
night, there`s still the possibility for reduced visbys to develop
at KSTS/KLVK/KOAK/KSJC through mid morning. It`s been a tricky
fog forecast with the surface low and associated dry cold front
moving through the Bay Area currently. Tomorrow looks like it may
be another tricky fog forecast as well. While conditions may be
more ideal for low cigs/fog formation tomorrow morning, high
clouds will move into the region associated with a shortwave
trough moving over the Pacific NW, thus limiting radiational
cooling. However, models signal at sub VFR development early Sun
morning.

Winds today will be light to breezy generally under 10 knots. NW
winds will prevail in the post-frontal environment today.

Vicinity of SFO...Winds at SFO have just recently shifted NW as
the surface low has shifted S/SE. Still thinking that the terminal
should stay dry enough and remain VFR, while shallow fog is being
reported at KOAK. Onshore winds will become breezy around 7 to 10
knots by late afternoon. Chance for MVFR cigs to develop early in
the morning Sunday but confidence is low at this time.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO. If fog develops, it should
stay confined to the East Bay shoreline.

Monterey Bay Terminals...MVFR cigs persist. As dry cold front
approaches in the next few hours this morning, cigs are expected
to lift and conditions will become VFR. However, moderate
confidence exists on the exact timing that conditions will improve,
but will be between 13z-17z. Some hi-res models think after 15z,
so may have to see how things play out and will adjust taf if
necessary. Onshore winds this afternoon around 5 to 10 knots.
Moderate confidence that MVFR cigs return just beyond the taf
period (early Sun morning).

.MARINE...
(Today through Thursday)
Issued at 342 AM PST Sat Dec 23 2023

  Gale force gusts continue north of Point Reyes, but overall
winds are starting to diminish and will continue to through the
day today, becoming gentle to moderate. Northwest swell will build
in through the day as well, resulting in elevated seas of 9 to 11
feet which will keep conditions hazardous for small crafts through
tonight. A new long period northwest swell will arrive early
Christmas morning. More unsettled weather returns midweek next
week.
