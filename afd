...New AVIATION, MARINE...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 1201 AM PST Fri Nov 29 2024

Cold conditions during the overnight periods through Saturday
morning. Slight warming trend Saturday through next week.

&&

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 1201 AM PST Fri Nov 29 2024

Clouds: nature`s blanket. High clouds from the deep upper-level low
off the California/Mexico border in the Eastern Pacific Ocean will
have two impacts on the area: temperatures and sunrises/sunsets. The
thicker the clouds, the less outgoing longwave radiation is emitted,
thus temperatures run relatively warmer. The thinner the clouds, the
more outgoing longwave radiation is emitted, thus temperatures run
relatively cooler. The locations and thickness of the clouds or lack
thereof will undoubtedly have an impact on minimum temperatures;
nonetheless it will be cold and a Frost Advisory remains in
effect through 9 AM Friday for interior portions of the Bay Area
and Central Coast. The stream of clouds will also allow for more
colorful sunrises and sunsets.

&&

.LONG TERM...
(Saturday through Thursday)
Issued at 1201 AM PST Fri Nov 29 2024

High confidence in the long term forecast period as global ensemble
clusters are in agreement of ridging dominating the pattern. This
will result in a slight warming trend and the return of near normal
temperatures.
