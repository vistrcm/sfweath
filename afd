...New AVIATION, MARINE...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 1224 AM PDT Fri Aug 4 2023

Warming trend through the weekend as an upper level ridge
migrates over the area. Temperatures moderate to seasonal averages
for the rest of next week.

&&

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 1224 AM PDT Fri Aug 4 2023

An upper level ridge over the Desert Southwest migrates westward
over the next few days, resulting in an increase in daytime
temperatures and a decrease in the depth of the marine layer over
the next couple of days. High temperatures for today reach into the
upper 80s and lower 90s for the interior valleys, the mid to upper
60s along the Pacific coast, and the upper 60s to mid 70s for the
Bayshore.

&&

.LONG TERM...
(Saturday through Thursday)
Issued at 0115 AM PDT Fri Aug 4 2023

Saturday will see continued warming, with an Moderate HeatRisk for
the interior valleys, which means that populations vulnerable to
heat effects (including children, the elderly, or those working or
living outdoors) have a moderate risk of experiencing heat-related
illnesses. Morning low temperatures will be in the mid to upper 50s
in the lower elevations, with lows in the mid to upper 60s for the
higher elevations. Then the daytime will see highs up to the low to
mid 90s for the interior valleys, with the most inland locations
approaching 100, while the Bayshore sees temperatures in the mid to
upper 70s and the coast seeing temperatures in the mid to upper 60s.
Sunday morning lows will see a modest increase in the lower
elevations, with lows rising to near 60 in the warmest spots, but
locations above the marine layer will see more robust rises with
several of the very highest locations rising into the low to mid 70s.

We are coming closer to the hottest time of the year, so here`s a
reminder of our tips for heat events:

* Stay hydrated and drink plenty of fluids.
* Wear lightweight, light-colored clothing.
* Reduce time spent outdoors or stay in the shade.
* Never leave people or pets unattended in vehicles.

Warming trend continues into Sunday, which is projected to be the
warmest day. Temperatures are not expected to get as hot compared
to previous heat ups this summer, but nonetheless Moderate
HeatRisk persist Sunday for interior regions, where temperatures
will approach 100-105 F. Warm conditions continue into Monday,
but max temperatures will be a few degrees cooler by the start of
the upcoming work week.

Noticeable difference in temperatures will be felt by Tues-Wed
next week as weak troughing settles in over the eastern
Pacific, supporting onshore flow and likely deepening of the
marine layer.

Low confidence at this time, but continuing to watch for remnants
of tropical disturbance which could bring an influx of upper level
moisture around Aug 10-11 (as indicated by long range
deterministic models).

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 439 AM PDT Fri Aug 4 2023

Localized dense fog (over the North Bay valleys) and shallow cigs
resulting in IFR- LIFR conditions early this morning. Further
inland terminals (KSJC/KLVK) remain VFR. Generally low to moderate
confidence in regards to when low clouds will clear this morning,
but general consensus between hi- res and LAMP guidance is
between 16-17z for North Bay terminals and 18-19z for SF Bay and
Monterey Bay terminals. Breezy onshore winds return with coastal
terminals seeing gusts up to 25-28 knots during the afternoon.
IFR-LIFR conditions return tonight with more patchy fog as marine
layer will likely continue to compress. Low to moderate confidence
on timing of arrival tonight.

Vicinity of SFO...Moderate confidence of clearing time around
18-19z today. Could briefly improve to MVFR cigs before clearing
to VFR later this morning. W/NW winds continue, becoming gusty in
the afternoon and evening hours. Low clouds return tonight, but
timing remains slightly uncertain. Could arrive as early as 04z,
but most likely after 06z, persisting through the night into
Saturday morning.

SFO Bridge Approach...Nighttime satellite shows bridge approach is
mostly clear, but will fill in with low clouds later this morning.

Monterey Bay Terminals...IFR currently with chance of LIFR as the
morning progresses. Less confidence for LIFR, but tempo included
to account for the possibility this morning. VFR for the
afternoon with NW wind gusts up to 15-22 knots. Low clouds return
this evening, bringing another round of IFR and more likely LIFR
as marine layer compresses into tomorrow.

&&

.MARINE...
(Today through Wednesday)
Issued at 216 AM PDT Fri Aug 4 2023

Breezy northwest winds continue, becoming increasingly gusty
tonight into Saturday. High end small craft advisories will exist
for much of the coastal waters as gusts approach 30-35 knots over
the outer waters tonight into Saturday. These strong northwest
winds continue to generate short period wind waves. In addition,
long period southwesterly swell and moderate period southerly
swell will continue into next week.
