...New SYNOPSIS, SHORT TERM, LONG TERM, AVIATION, MARINE...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 405 AM PST Thu Jan 23 2025

Another cold start leading to a beautiful afternoon today across
our area with above normal daytime high temperatures. Friday
brings a noticeable pattern change with a colder airmass and
increasing precipitation chances across the Central Coast for the
weekend.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 405 AM PST Thu Jan 23 2025

Amplified ridging pattern continues to dominate ambient weather
across our area today. After another relatively cold start to the
day, temperatures across the North Bay and Bay Area will be similar
to yesterday, while the South Bay and Central Coast climb into the
low to mid 70s under clear skies and light winds. A deepening upper
level trough will begin moving south out of the Pacific Northwest
later today, flattening the upper ridge overnight as it gradually
works south. Overnight lows into early Friday will be slightly
warmer than recent mornings, but still below normal in most
locations.

.LONG TERM...
(Friday through Wednesday)
Issued at 405 AM PST Thu Jan 23 2025

A pattern change will be in full swing across our region by sunrise
Friday morning. The aforementioned upper trough moving south will
bring the first of two cold fronts into our area by Friday
afternoon. Increasing clouds on the leading edge of the upper trough
out ahead of the surface cold front will keep highs in the North Bay
and Bay area in the low to mid 60s, upper 50s along the coast.
Daytime highs farther south ahead of the cold front will peak in the
upper 60s to low 70s over the Central Coast.

By early Saturday morning, the disturbance begins to split off from
the Polar Jet as a closed upper low develops over our area. Cold
Arctic sourced air aloft will result in H85 temps around 0C (approx
5-6 degrees below normal for this time of year) accelerating
impressive low level lapse rates to 9-10 degrees/km in the
surface/marine boundary layer by early Saturday afternoon. Shallow
low level moisture will be a limiting factor, however deterministic
guidance has trended slightly west with the center of the upper low,
allowing more time over coastal waters to draw moisture from. NBM
PoPs seems to capture that potential with increased chances over
Monterey County and San Benito County from previous forecasts.
Chance for thunderstorms remain around or less than 10 percent attm,
but will continue to be watched closely. The second, stronger
surface cold front arrives Saturday morning bringing a surge of
reinforced colder air across our region. Highs on Saturday and Sunday
will struggle to reach 60 area wide, and remain in the 40s for
higher elevations. Potential for accumulating snow, especially in
the San Lucias will also be watched closely, with the freezing
line still around 4000ft. Strong northerly winds at higher
elevations may require a Wind Advisory as soon as early Saturday
morning across higher elevations of the North Bay Interior
Mountains and East Bay Hills, with gusty winds not easing until
later Sunday night. Cooler Arctic air continues channeling south
on the back side of the exiting low through most of next week,
until upper ridging begins to build over the West Coast late next
week.
