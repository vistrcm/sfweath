...New SYNOPSIS, SHORT TERM, LONG TERM, AVIATION, MARINE...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 400 AM PST Mon Dec 18 2023

Widespread showers with some thunderstorm potential are moving
through the Bay Area this morning with more rain on the way this
week.

&&

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 400 AM PST Mon Dec 18 2023

The instability has exceeded expectations overnight. The latest RAP
guidance suggests most-unstable CAPE values of roughly 500 J/kg. The
instability is mostly elevated and focused over the ocean, with lack-
luster surface based numbers. This MUCAPE is still relatively high
for coastal California and the impressive nocturnal convection has
clearly been able to tap into this energy. Most of the stronger
showers will subside by noon today, but lighter rain will linger
through the day with another band of strong showers possible Monday
night into Tuesday morning.

Monday will also bring strong southerly winds to coastal areas and
any inland valleys with a S or SE exposure. Gale force wind gusts
are possible along the coast in Big Sur from Point Lobos to Point
Sur in the afternoon.

.LONG TERM...
(Tuesday through Sunday)
Issued at 400 AM PST Mon Dec 18 2023

Tuesday and Wednesday:

The long term forecast is complex. On the ground, it will just seem
like a prolonged rainy week. However, there will be a hand-off of
the driving synoptic system sometime on Tuesday. The slow moving
gale force low over the Pacific that brought warm moist air to the
region Sun-Mon will finally move off towards the Pacific Northwest.
Meanwhile a high-latitude upper level trough will sling-shot west
of the old parent low to take its place as a new deep cut-off low.
This new feature should be located a few hundred miles west of San
Francisco by Wednesday. Due to the complex steering flow of this
interaction, the uncertainty is quite high regarding how close the
low will be to the coast on Wednesday. This distance will have a big
effect on impacts, with a closer system having the potential to
generate excessive rainfall along the coast. Current guidance has
trended wetter, specifically for the Big Sur coast and further into
southern California. Despite the high uncertainty, the QPF forecast
hasn`t changed drastically. The coastal mountains are now expecting
about 4-7 inches of rain over the week, which is about an inch more
than we expected 24 hours ago.

Thursday and beyond:

By Thursday, the cut-off low will drift far enough south to bring
drier, off-shore flow to the Bay Area. Lingering showers are still
possible, but will be confined mainly south of Golden Gate in the
morning. A ridge is expected to build in Friday, which should lead
to a dry holiday weekend before the chance for rain returns by the
middle of next week.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 400 AM PST Mon Dec 18 2023

Numerous showers and isolated thunderstorms this morning with
decreasing coverage this afternoon. Visibility restrictions
generally 4-5 SM in SHRA, but could briefly lower to IFR for a
short time should a heavier shower impact a terminal. So far
ceilings have haven`t lowered as much as previously anticipated so
opted to go a little more optimistic in the current TAFs. That
said, do anticipate a lowering later today into tonight with a
trend towards MVFR-IFR. Increasing winds this afternoon as low
pressure approaches with a shift towards the south and southwest.

Vicinity of SFO...Numerous showers this morning with a low
potential (10% or less) for an isolated thunderstorm in the
vicinity. Left this out of the TAF for now due to low confidence
in occurrence and timing. Decreasing shower coverage this
afternoon with breezy to gusts south to southeast winds. Low
potential (10%) for gusts to reach 30+ kt this afternoon but this
isn`t explicitly advertised in the current TAF. Expect gradually
lowering ceilings into this evening with continued shower chances.

SFO Bridge Approach... Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...Numerous showers this morning with
decreasing shower coverage this afternoon. Breezy to gusty
southeast winds through this afternoon with a gradual shift
towards the south-southwest.

.MARINE...
(Today through Saturday)
Issued at 400 AM PST Mon Dec 18 2023

Widespread showers and isolated thunderstorms will continue
through the morning as a gale-force low in the Pacific pumps warm
moist air to the coastal waters. In addition, strong SE flow will
gust to gale force at times along the Big Sur Coast and in the NW
waters today. A large SW swell is building across the waters
associated with this system. Significant wave heights will peak at
9-12 ft today, gradually abate Tuesday, and then rebuild to rough
Wednesday as another low moves into the East Pacific. This second
low will eventually move towards Southern California, causing the
prevailing wind direction to flip to Northerly by Friday.
