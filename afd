...New AVIATION...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 249 AM PDT Wed Jul 26 2023

A gradual cooling trend will take place from mid-to-late week
with the warmest temperatures remaining across the interior. Very
little day-to-day fluctuations expected into the upcoming weekend
and early next week temperatures generally near seasonal averages.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 249 AM PDT Wed Jul 26 2023

The fickle marine layer has been oscillating in depth between 600
ft to around 1000 ft in the past 24 hours. It`s almost like
the trough to our north and the ridge to our south are playing tug
of war with the marine layer on which one will have the more
dominant influence. Without a steady increasing or decreasing
trend, it`s been difficult to nail down where marine stratus will
set up and how far inland any cooling influence from the marine
air may occur.

Night Fog satellite imagery started off with fairly clear skies
along the coast while the marine stratus deck was well offshore.
Around 10:30 pm last night, a small patch of stratus developed
around Pt Reyes. Now (3 am) there is a growing stratus deck from
Bodega Bay southward along the SF Peninsula wrapping into the
Monterey Peninsula which includes stratus pushing through the
Golden Gate Bridge and filling the East Bay from Richmond to
Oakland. Expect continued development of marine stratus along
coastal areas which will keep them in the mid 60s to mid 70s this
afternoon. Warmer temperatures inland away from the marine
influence will range in the upper 70s into the 90s. Hottest areas
will be in far northern Sonoma & Napa counties, far East Bay
adjacent to the central valley, and southern San Benito & Monterey
counties.

So when will the marine layer deepen??? Well, this afternoon looks
more promising as the NAM, GFS, and ECMWF all indicate a weak
vorticity max moving into the Bay Area associated with the trough
over NorCal. This might be the feature that will finally help the
marine layer increase to over 1000 ft deep. Timing looks to be
around 11 am to noon. If it does play out, then we could see an
earlier return of coastal clouds tonight

.LONG TERM...
(Thursday through Tuesday)
Issued at 249 AM PDT Wed Jul 26 2023

As stated in earlier discussions, the synoptic pattern won`t
change much as our CWA remains situated between the upper level
trough over NorCal and the ever-persistent broad high pressure
cell stuck over the Southern US. The trough to our north will have
another low swing down along the Western Canadian coastline and
linger there through the rest of this week. That feature should
aid in keeping our marine layer as a cooling factor through the
weekend as it nudges the high pressure to our south. By early next
week, that low moves into inland Canada and the high to our south
builds slightly back towards our CWA which will help bump up
temperatures slightly.

Overall, though, daytime highs should only oscillate by about 5 to
7 degrees through the upcoming 7 day forecast.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 443 AM PDT Wed Jul 26 2023

Satellite shows stratus building off the coast with an onshore
flow allowing some of the stratus to funnel over some of the coastal
terminals. Therefore, a mix of VFR and IFR CIGs currently. As the
stratus continues to build, expect the North Bay and Monterey Bay
terminals to experience low cigs and low visibility creating
IFR/LIFR criteria, as the marine layer is still compressed. Other
terminals, especially inland, are expected to remain VFR through the
TAF period. KOAK, Monterey Bay and North Bay terminals are expected
to clear near 16-18Z with stratus returning in the night as the
marine layer is expected to deepen. Some uncertainty on ceiling
heights but models suggest MVFR/IFR conditions tonight. Onshore
winds are expected to become breezy in the afternoon with coastal
gaps and valleys experiencing gusty winds up to 25 knots.

Vicinity of SFO...Currently VFR but stratus surrounds the terminal.
Therefore, there is a chance for IFR CIGs, but had low confidence to
include in TAFs at this moment. Any stratus that spills over into
the terminal is expected to clear near 17Z.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...Currently VFR but is expected to go IFR
soon as Salinas Valley is filled in and KMRY is right behind. Expect
stratus to lift near 17Z. Onshore winds are expected to become
breezy near the afternoon with Salinas Valley experiencing gusty
winds up to 19 knots. Stratus is expected to return tonight with
uncertainty of ceiling heights but expect IFR conditions tonight.

.MARINE...
(Today through Monday)
Issued at 249 AM PDT Wed Jul 26 2023

Gusty northwest winds continue over the coastal waters through
mid week. Gale force gusts develop near favored coastal jet
regions such as the Big Sur coast. Wind waves will create
hazardous conditions for small crafts. Light southerly swell
persists through the week, with a northwest swell arriving towards
midweek.

.MTR WATCHES/WARNINGS/ADVISORIES...
CA...None.
PZ...Small Craft Advisory until 3 AM PDT Friday for PZZ540-545-570-
     575.

     Small Craft Advisory from 10 AM this morning to 9 PM PDT this
     evening for PZZ560.
