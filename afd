...New AVIATION...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 345 AM PDT Thu Oct 5 2023

Warm temperatures expected through the end of the week with
elevated HeatRisk across much of the interior. A Heat Advisory is
in effect for SF Peninsula, SF Bay Shoreline, Santa Clara Valley
(including San Jose), and the Santa Cruz Mountains starting at 11
am today lasting until 11 pm Friday. Heat will begin to ease on
Saturday but will still 5 to 15 degrees above climatological
normals. Cooler temperatures really arrive Sunday into early next
week as pattern change will be underway.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 347 AM PDT Thu Oct 5 2023

Wednesday`s initial development of offshore pressure gradient and
wind (combined ACV-SFO and WMC-SFO gradients) has primarily evolved
in to a WMC-SFO pressure gradient early this morning. The WMC-SFO
pressure gradient currently ~ 10 mb. Lower level thermal ridging
connecting to diurnal surface warming including offshore winds to
the coastline with a surface thermal trough nudged just offshore
brought warm to hot temperatures Wednesday, and aside from an
above October normal precipitable water (per Oakland upper air
soundings) an otherwise widespread continental influence to the
coastline. Daytime highs were above to much above early October
normals, the long term sites record highs however remained intact.
Sep-Oct are our usual offshore flow months with a re-energized
jet stream.

A Heat Advisory (WMO header WWUS76) for San Francisco, the San
Francisco Bay Shoreline, the Santa Cruz Mountains and the Santa
Clara Valley remains in effect from 11 am today to 11 pm Friday.

We`re off to a clear start, including over the coastal waters so
far this morning per satellite imagery. The HRRR model recently
forecasting patchy coastal fog, however none showing up so far.
The warmest temperatures are in the hills and mountains with
readings in the 70s within the lower level temperature inversion,
in the valleys below the inversion with mainly light to calm winds
and radiative cooling underway are allowing temperatures to lower
to the mid to upper 50s to around 60. Observations show there`s
hardly any wind this morning even at elevation in the hills and
mountains, with exception of modest northeast wind gusts to 20-30
mph on the summit of Mt St Helena. Cool air drainage winds from
the southeast are developing in the Salinas Valley. Otherwise
light winds and the distribution of water vapor highest from the
surface to approx 8000 feet per last evening`s Oakland upper sounding
easing already marginal fire weather concerns.

With lower level thermal ridging firmly in place coupled to a
fairly healthy WMC-SFO pressure gradient, and only a shallow
marine layer depth of approx 300 feet, daytime highs will climb
quickly again once the sun rises. Highs are forecast to reach the
80s and 90s inland and to the Bays and Delta, the immediate
coastal sections having modest marine influxes of marine air
beginning by early afternoon. 850 mb temperatures warm a couple
more degrees Celsius today with light anti-cyclonic lower level
winds possibly enhancing coastal mountain high temperatures today.
Also seeing forecast surface theta-e holding steady today
compared to Wednesday afternoon so there`s equal chances that
daytime highs remain similar to Wednesday`s. Most of today`s
record highs are from a 1987 heatwave, reanalysis showing back
then a strong 592-599 decameter 500 mb high to our west. Today`s
pattern is different with a strong 500 mb high ~ 300 miles west of
the Pacific Northwest and currently there`s a weak 500 mb low
overhead. Today`s highs (and Friday`s onward into the weekend)
hinge mostly on the strength of the lower level temperature inversion
and the WMC-SFO pressure gradient.

.LONG TERM...
(Friday through Wednesday)
Issued at 347 AM PDT Thu Oct 5 2023

Large diurnal temperature changes from morning to afternoon
continuing Friday; the lower level temperature inversion, daytime
surface heating and the offshore directed WMC-SFO pressure
gradient are the primary drivers of the pattern. The NAM forecasts
the WMC-SFO gradient to start weakening if not Friday morning then
by Saturday morning. Cooling arrives over the weekend and continues
next week, then a chance of rain arrives Monday into Tuesday. The
00z/06z GFS forecasts show ~ 1.60" precipitable water by early
Tuesday morning, far above the maximum moving average in October
on Oakland climatology if that forecast verifies. Chance of rain
also depends on the strength of dynamics, will be interesting to
monitor.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 403 AM PDT Thu Oct 5 2023

VFR through the TAF period. The ridge pattern continues to limit
cloud development as well as surface winds over the next few
days. This will cause light and variable winds overnight, and
light to moderate winds during the day.

Vicinity of SFO...VFR through the TAF period. Expect light and
variable winds through the mid afternoon which will become more
moderate for the late afternoon. Expect light and variable winds
again for into Thursday night.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO

Monterey Bay Terminals...VFR through the TAF period. Winds stay
light the morning and into the afternoon. Expect moderate
westerly winds to build in the mid to late afternoon. Winds become
light again in the late Thursday evening.

&&

.MARINE...
(Tonight through next Monday)
Issued at 235 AM PDT Thu Oct 5 2023

Light to moderate north winds are expected through the weekend.
Current northwest swell continues to diminish through the end of
the week as another light northwest swell train arrives early
Friday. Light southerly swell continues into next week.
