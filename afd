.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 354 AM PST Wed Dec 6 2023

Patchy dense fog across the region mainly confined to the
immediate coastline and the N Bay Valleys. Rain will return to the
Bay Area this morning, bringing 0.25" to 0.75" across the region
(higher amounts across the N Bay). Rain chances linger through
Thursday. Colder lows expected Friday and Saturday mornings with
freezing temps possible. Warming trend expected early next week.

&&

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 354 AM PST Wed Dec 6 2023

Currently patchy dense fog is being reported across the N Bay
interior valleys and near the Monterey Bay San Mateo coastline.
As mentioned in the evening update, meteorological conditions are
less favorable for widespread radiation fog formation (as was seen
the previous morning) with high clouds lingering over the N Bay
ahead our next rain-making system. However, night fog satellite
imagery shows low clouds/fog moving north parallel across the
coast. Hi-res model that patchy dense fog may still spread across
the bay shoreline especially after 5-6 am. Will continue to
monitor closely through the morning and track the fog that`s
moving parallel to the coastline. If fog stays limited to the N
Bay and coastline post-sunrise, this may prompt a cancellation of
the Dense Fog Advisory for the bay shoreline and SF Peninsula.
Will also have to closely monitor fog development near the
Monterey Bay.

Zooming out, midlevel water vapor satellite imagery shows the
broad upper trough currently located over the E Pacific, bringing
lots of moisture to the Pacific NW and NorCal. This storm system
will continue to move south through the morning today. We`re still
expecting a beneficial rain to move through the Bay Area with the
brunt of the rain moving through beginning this morning lasting
through the afternoon. However, moisture (IVT and PWATs) start to
fizzle out by the time it reaches the Bay Area, so we won`t be
expecting flooding concerns. As front passes today, breezy winds
with gusts up to 20-30 mph possible this afternoon. Scattered,
post- frontal showers linger this evening and tonight. Forecasted
amounts have not changed much since previous forecasts with
generally 0.25" to 0.65" across the interior North Bay with higher
amounts of 0.75" to up to an inch across the coastal hills of the
N Bay. The rest of the Bay Area further south is still expected
to see less today with rain shadowed valleys seeing less than
0.10" to 0.25"-0.35".

.LONG TERM...
(Thursday through Tuesday)
Issued at 354 AM PST Wed Dec 6 2023

As the upper level trough exits the region, a weak disturbance will
bring an additional push of rain that will move through early
Thursday, bringing an additional few hundredths to up to a tenth of
an inch to the Bay Area. Rain chances diminish by Thursday
afternoon.

In wake of this system, a colder airmass is on track to move in
across the West Coast, bringing colder overnight lows. Thursday
night into Friday will be the first cold night of the week with
interior valleys dipping into the 30s. The usual cold spots such as
the interior N Bay valleys and interior Monterey Co will see the
best chance for freezing temps overnight Thurs as well as overnight
Friday into Saturday. Right now, higher confidence exists for Sat
morning the best chance for freezing temps in the aforementioned
areas with NBM highlighting 80-90% chance of freezing temps. These
temperatures will be hazardous for vulnerable populations as well as
sensitive vegetation. Fri-Sat mornings look to be the coldest with
potential cold lingering into Sunday morning, but temperatures start
to warm early next week.

High pressure aloft that will build this weekend will start to
weaken/flatten as ridging aloft becomes more amplified across the E
Pacific. Generally benign and dry weather expected early next week
with subtle warming trend as E Pacific ridge moves east over the
west coast.

Still looking like mid Dec will be our next chance for rain.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 354 AM PST Wed Dec 6 2023

Patchy LIFR-IFR stratus and fog across the North Bay valleys and
along the immediate coast. Model output is showing more extensive
stratus than seen on satellite imagery, especially in the SF Bay
area. Thus, confidence in the ceiling and visibility forecasts until
the morning is somewhat lower than earlier tonight. Have opted to
convert the most pessimistic forecasts into TEMPO groups, will need
to monitor stratus evolution for the rest of the night. Expecting
lifting ceilings in the morning, but ceilings remain broken to
overcast as a cold front approaches. The main frontal rain band
arrives in the early afternoon, passing through the region into the
evening hours. Winds will build from the south to southwest at up to
10-15 knots, shifting towards the west as the front passes. The
overnight hours should see scattered post-frontal showers and
perhaps some clearing of skies, before a second band comes through
on Thursday after the end of the 24 hour TAF period.

Vicinity of SFO... Moderate confidence in LIFR-IFR ceilings
developing later this morning. MVFR ceilings associated with the
incoming cold front develop this morning, with the most intense rain
expected in the afternoon hours. Southwest winds up to 12 knots
developing this afternoon, shifting to the west after the cold front
passes. Low to moderate confidence in some scattering of ceilings
overnight before a second rain band comes later on Thursday beyond
the TAF period.

SFO Bridge Approach... Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals... Coastal stratus just beginning to build
onshore, and LIFR conditions are expected to develop at MRY within
the hour. Ceilings lifting to MVFR later this morning, with rain
coming in the afternoon through the evening hours. Winds will build
to up to 10 knots from the south and southwest, turning more towards
the west after the front passes.

.MARINE...
Issued at 354 AM PST Wed Dec 6 2023

Moderate to fresh winds developing across the northern outer waters
will spread into the central and southern waters through the day
today with winds briefly shifting from NW to S/SW ahead of an
incoming cold front. Dense fog is possible for the San Francisco
Bay, San Pablo Bay, and the delta starting before sunrise and
will last through mid morning. Elevated seas between 12-17 feet
will persist through late week as a series of long period
northwest swells propagate through the waters, resulting in
hazardous conditions for small craft operators. Chances of rain
over the waters will begin tonight and continue through the end of
the work week.

&&

.BEACHES...
Issued at 354 AM PST Wed Dec 6 2023

A stronger long period northwest swell has arrived with coastal buoys
reporting waves of 15-16 feet at 16-18. Swell is expected to peak
this morning with peak breaking waves between 18 to 22 feet.
A high surf advisory is in effect through 4AM Wednesday for
Coastal North Bay, SF Peninsula Coast, Southern Monterey Bay and
Big Sur Coasts. A beach hazards statement remains in effect until
late Wednesday night from Northern Monterey Bay Coast. Dangerous
ocean conditions for inexperienced surfers and swimmers with
increased risk of rip current development. Use increased caution
if going to the beach as unexpected sneaker waves may sweep people
into the water. Avoid rocks and jetties. Avoid steep beaches.
Stay farther back from the water and never turn your back on the
ocean.
