...New AVIATION, MARINE...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 1234 AM PDT Fri Aug 9 2024

Hot temperatures continue inland, with a gradual cooling trend
beginning on Sunday into early next week.

&&

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 1234 AM PDT Fri Aug 9 2024

An upper level ridge over the western United States is continuing to
degrade, resulting in a more robust marine layer and a slight
cooling trend in most of the region. Satellite products show an
expanding stratus deck making its way across the coastal valleys,
with the forecast calling for stratus to expand across the interior
valleys across the rest of the morning before starting to mix out in
the mid- to late morning hours. Some patchy coastal drizzle, mist,
and fog is possible through the rest of the morning. Low
temperatures this morning are generally in the 50s in the valleys,
and up to the mid 70s in the thermal belts. Today`s highs will be
similar to yesterday`s with the interior valleys seeing highs from
the mid 80s to upper 90s, with some triple digit heat continuing in
the far interior regions, the lower 70s to lower 80s in the
Bayshore, and the upper 50s to mid 60s along the Pacific coast.
Onshore winds will be breezy today with wind gusts up to 20 miles
per hour in most locations, perhaps closer to 30 miles per hour in
favored gaps and passes, including parts of the Salinas Valley.

.LONG TERM...
(Saturday through Thursday)
Issued at 1234 AM PDT Fri Aug 9 2024

Saturday should feature conditions similar to today`s. Ensemble
model and cluster analysis products support an upper level trough
coming into the western United States beginning on Sunday, which
sets a substantial cooling trend that will extend into the early
part of next week. By mid-week, high temperatures should stabilize
around the 80s to lower 90s inland and the upper 50s to the 60s in
the coastal regions. Onshore winds should remain breezy in the
afternoons and evenings, and marine layer stratus is expected to
penetrate inland overnight and into the mornings. CPC outlooks
continue to suggest a lean towards temperatures near or below
seasonal averages into the third week of August.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 430 AM PDT Fri Aug 9 2024

Currently LIFR-IFR at all terminals except LVK with solid stratus
coverage along the coast and through the valleys. Widespread VFR
will prevail by this afternoon. Winds will remain onshore through
the TAF period. Slant range visibilities will likely be reduced due
to haze and smoke.

Vicinity of SFO...Currently IFR with westerly flow. High confidence
that the terminal will remain IFR through 16Z. Winds will prevail
out of the west through the TAF period with gusts up to 25 knots to
be expected. Moderate confidence that an IFR ceiling will return to
the terminal tonight.

SFO Bridge Approach...Low clouds will linger through 18Z and filter
back in at 03Z.

Monterey Bay Terminals...Currently LIFR with westerly flow at both
terminals. Brief clearing is expected this afternoon with a quick
return to IFR slated for this evening. Winds will prevail out of the
west/northwest through the TAF period.

&&

.MARINE...
(Today through Wednesday)
Issued at 430 AM PDT Fri Aug 9 2024

The pressure gradient between subtropical high pressure and lower
pressure over California will tighten over the next couple days,
increasing winds to a fresh to strong northwesterly breeze. These
breezes will build rough seas over the outer waters.
