.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 105 AM PDT Sat Sep 2 2023

An upper low will bring cooler temperatures, more cloud cover, and
a few light showers to the region this weekend. Quiet weather
thereafter with a slow warming trend next week.

&&

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 105 AM PDT Sat Sep 2 2023

Moisture channel imagery early this morning reveals a low pressure
area centered over northwest California with upper ridging
downstream over the Great Plains. 850-700 hPa layered precipitable
water values of around one half inch are nosing into the bay area
with a corresponding mid level cloud deck evident above the stratus.
The best moisture, lift, and instability remain well to our east
where showers and isolated storms are ongoing from portions of the
Sierra through the Great Basin and Desert Southwest.

The upper low will remain our primary weather driver through the
short-term with a continuation of increased cloud cover aloft and
onshore breezes. Some disruption of the marine layer should occur,
so coastal stratus may become more patchy as opposed to
widespread. Where the stratus takes hold areas of drizzle are
expected during the late night/morning hours. And with weak lift
and the nearby low can`t rule out a few light rain showers as
well. Regardless, any amounts from drizzle or light rain will be
quite minimal for those who do see it. Temperatures will remain
on the cool side with highs ranging from around 65 of the coast to
around 75 for the warmer inland valleys. A few of the typically
hotter places may approach 80 degrees. Lows tonight should drop
off into the mid 50s to lower 60s, with the warmest readings along
the coast and bays.

.LONG TERM...
(Sunday through Friday)
Issued at 105 AM PDT Sat Sep 2 2023

The upper low will devolve to an open-wave trough early next week as
it rejoins the westerlies and departs the region. Another weak low
should enter NorCal quickly thereafter but should remain progressive
and exit by midweek. Thereafter the upper flow pattern becomes more
WSW around a strengthening high pressure ridge over the Four Corners
region. This pattern should promote a continuation of cool onshore
flow initially, with a slow warm-up late week into next weekend.
Nothing looks particularly notable in the heat department so far,
but the warmest inland places could be back into the 85 to 95 degree
range towards the start of next weekend.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 501 AM PDT Sat Sep 2 2023

Satellite imagery this morning shows stratus enveloping the Monterey
Bay and East Bay Hills, with the marine layer depth having increased
thanks to an upper level low circling about the area, which has also
brought mid-level clouds that are expected to linger through the
day. Ceilings throughout the region vary from MVFR near 2500` to
just beyond MVFR at 3500`. A smattering of VFR-MVFR conditions are
currently in place across the region as a result. Though generally
expecting most terminals to improve to VFR conditions beyond
sunrise, with the latest clearing to VFR towards 17/18Z. Current
light winds increase during the day to become westerly and breezy
around 10-12 knots, locally higher near coastal gaps. Coastal
stratus expected to return towards the mid to late night of Saturday
into Sunday.

Vicinity of SFO...VFR lasting through the daytime hours today and
well into the night, though BKN to OVC skies are expected due to mid-
level clouds. First hints at coastal stratus return and MVFR CIGS
are not until the early morning hours of Sunday, though confidence
at this time is too low to include a CIG group. For now, VFR through
the TAF period. Winds westerly this afternoon increasing to around
15 knots, then weakening into the night to become light.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...MVFR ceilings expected to dissipate into
the late morning, near 16/17Z. Beyond then, VFR lasts into the mid
evening before MVFR conditions return once more. Winds onshore
around 8-12 knots this afternoon, weakening into the night.

.MARINE...
(Tonight through next Wednesday)
Issued at 1158 PM PDT Fri Sep 1 2023

There`s a chance for rain showers north of Point Reyes overnight
into tomorrow. Light winds will turn southerly tonight and
persist through the weekend. Breezy to gusty northwest winds
return early next week. Mixed, moderate period swell continues
through early next week. A new, long period northwest swell
arrives late Saturday night into Sunday morning, slowly
diminishing into next week.
