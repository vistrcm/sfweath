...New UPDATE...

Issued at 1259 AM PDT Wed Aug 28 2024

Another round of warm temperatures today, with a cooldown
beginning Thursday as troughing develops. Warmth returns early
next week as the next ridge develops.

.UPDATE...
Issued at 856 AM PDT Wed Aug 28 2024

Satellite imagery shows stratus present at the immediate coast and
extending across much of the Monterey Bay region and down into
the Salinas Valley. Inland stratus is expected to gradually mix
out through the course of the morning as temperatures increase.
Forecast is on track with no updates at this time.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 1259 AM PDT Wed Aug 28 2024

One more day of warmer than normal temperatures is expected today
before things begin to cooldown and usher in some more pleasant
weather. Ridging, the item responsible for this warmth, is
expected to begin decaying today, so while temperatures will be
warm, they are not expected to be as warm as those seen on
Tuesday, perhaps a few degrees cooler. That being said, high
temps for interior regions will reach into the 90s, with 80s
closer to the SF Bay. Along the coast, expect highs in the 60s
once more.

A compressed marine layer currently sitting around 800` will likely
lend poorly to any cooling effect, therefore allowing those bayside
areas usually protected by the marine layer to become warm this
afternoon. Additionally, given the compression, not expecting much
in the way of coastal stratus to push inland. Areas closest to the
coast will likely wake up to grey skies this morning, though this
should clear in the late morning. Isolated patches of fog around
Monterey Bay are also likely.

.LONG TERM...
(Thursday through Tuesday)
Issued at 1259 AM PDT Wed Aug 28 2024

Thursday, temperatures continue to drop, with this day marking
the beginning of the cooldown as an upper level trough approaches
the coast. These cooler temps last through the weekend with
interior regions generally seeing highs in the upper 80s, and
highs in the 70s around the bays. These temperatures will be close
to average, if not a few degrees below average. However, the cool
temperatures won`t last forever. Towards the beginning of next
week, models and cluster analysis seem to agree in a ridging
pattern developing, with CPC 6-10 and 8-14 day outlooks indicating
temperatures as "above normal" for our region. Stay tuned to see
how warm it will get.
