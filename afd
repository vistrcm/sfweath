...New AVIATION...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 300 AM PDT Sun May 28 2023

Weather conditions largely remain unchanged with unseasonably
cool temperatures to persist into the upcoming week. Widespread
night and morning low clouds will give way to inland clearing each
afternoon. The longer range outlook shows this pattern will
likely persist into early June.

&&

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 300 AM PDT Sun May 28 2023

A mid/upper level cut-off low pressure system currently off of
the northern California coast will continue to drop southward
during the next 24 hours. As such, mid-to-high level clouds can be
seen on satellite this morning above the widespread stratus which
has penetrated well inland. This feature aloft has allowed for
the marine layer to compress slightly resulting in more widespread
drizzle this morning, especially near the coast and in the
favored moist upslope regions of the North Bay and East Bay.
Clouds will be slower to clear this afternoon given the mid/upper
level feature aloft. This system will also support a low
probability (10-20%) for isolated showers and/or thunderstorms
over far northern Sonoma and Napa counties, however limited
daytime heating in response to cloud cover will hinder
development. For tonight, more of the same with the return of low
clouds and patchy drizzle.

&&

.LONG TERM...
(Monday through Saturday)
Issued at 300 AM PDT Sun May 28 2023

The aforementioned upper level low will linger off of the central
and southern California coast into early next week. As a result,
expecting more of the same under the influence of troughing. Thus,
temperatures will largely remain below seasonal averages with
widespread night and morning low clouds. Patchy drizzle is also
expected to persist in this pattern as it has for the past week or
so. There are some hints of slight warming late in the upcoming
week as the closed low shifts inland. However, a general troughing
pattern will persist off of the West Coast into early June.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 430 AM PDT Sun May 28 2023

What started out at IFR Saturday evening, has gradually lifted to
MVFR level cigs in relation to a weak boundary that is moving
through the region. With cigs so close to 1,000, IFR conditions
are still probable through 16Z. Patchy drizzle will be possible
through mid morning, but the cloud cover will be much trickier to
get rid of. High confidence in clearing for more inland terminals.
But another return of stratus clouds for MVFR/IFR cigs are
forecast for Sunday night.

Vicinity of SFO...West-southwest winds with cigs right around the
IFR/MVFR 1,000 foot level. Patchy drizzle may sporadically crop up,
but not expecting major impacts. There is a small chance for clouds
to break up Sunday afternoon, but stronger confidence in BKN cigs
remaining around the terminal, lowering back down to IFR Sunday
night. Winds will increase with the sea breeze in the afternoon,
with gusts around 20 knots.

SFO Bridge Approach...Approach is forecast to have cloud cover over
it through 20Z. After clearing Sunday afternoon, clouds return after
04Z.

Monterey Bay Terminals...Some cigs have lifted for more IFR/MVFR
conditions Sunday morning Patchy drizzle is expected Sunday morning.
VFR is forecast for inland terminals after 19Z, but higher
confidence in coastal terminals staying under clouds through Sunday.
Lowering back down to IFR Sunday night.

.MARINE...
(Today through Friday)
Issued at 300 AM PDT Sun May 28 2023

Moderate northwest winds continue through Memorial Day with the
strongest winds over the northern outer waters. Breezy to gusty
westerly winds are also expected across the San Francisco Bay,
San Pablo Bay, Suisun Bay, and the Delta each afternoon. Longer
period background southerly swell continues through late next
week.

.MTR WATCHES/WARNINGS/ADVISORIES...

     Small Craft Advisory until 9 AM PDT this morning for PZZ545-575.
