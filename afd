.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 413 AM PST Tue Nov 12 2024

A small area of light rain moving southeast across Point Reyes early
this Tuesday morning (3AM) dissipated before reaching Half Moon Bay
as progressive shortwave ridging aloft sets in behind the exiting
surface front to our south and east. Expect to see some patchy fog
to continue along the coast from the Bay Area south into Monterey
Bay, especially southern Santa Cruz County. Farther inland seeing
some patchy fog in southern Santa Clara and northern San Benito
County. No Dense Fog is expected attm.

A mix of sun and clouds today will see temperatures bump up a few
degrees today from yesterday as the next upper trough bringing more
rain deepens over open water to our west. Cooler, drier air in the
wake of the surface cold front that pushed through yesterday will
linger at the surface today. Overnight lows tonight into early
Wednesday will drop into the upper 20s to low 30s in valleys across
southern Monterey County, and could result in some isolated areas of
dense fog overnight. Farther north, we`ll see areas of light rain
begin to move onshore from the North Bay south into the Santa Cruz
mountains around sunrise Wednesday morning, with coverage increasing
south and east through the remainder of the day. Once again, the
North Bay is expected to see the highest totals with help from
orographic effects. Most other locations south along the coast and
farther inland may see up to a quarter of an inch by late Wednesday
night.

.LONG TERM...
(Wednesday through Monday)
Issued at 413 AM PST Tue Nov 12 2024

Unsettled pattern will keep temperatures cool with several rounds of
mostly light rain in the extended forecast through the remainder of
the work week and into the weekend. During the day on Friday, the
main trough over our area has a neutral tilt and the southern
portion of trough begins to pinch off and dive south from the
Central Valley toward SOCAL late Friday night through Saturday. Most
of our area will be in a dry slot on Saturday before rain chances
ramp up again later in the day Sunday into Sunday night, as another
more progressive trough pushes through for the beginning of next
week. Overall, there is low confidence in the exact timing and
location for the weekend rain chances, and will have to wait to see
the trajectory of the splitting low. However, consensus in the
deterministic guidance is decent for this far out in time.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 448 AM PST Tue Nov 12 2024

It`s a mix of clear sky /VFR/, areas of low clouds /MVFR/ and fog
/VLIFR-IFR/ this morning. Post cold frontal air mass and nocturnal
radiative cooling supports additional low clouds and fog development
through sunrise. By late morning and early afternoon light mixing will
lift conditions to more widespread VFR. Tonight and Wednesday morning
patchy low clouds and fog /MVFR-VLIFR/ will redevelop under similar
conditions to this morning.

Vicinity of SFO....VFR. Mainly light winds.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...VFR except patchy low clouds /MVFR/ nearby
until late morning. Light southeast cold air drainage winds this
morning, becoming onshore 5 to 10 knots in the afternoon, then light
southeast drainage winds tonight and Wednesday morning.

.MARINE...
(Today through Sunday)
Issued at 901 AM PST Tue Nov 12 2024

Despite gentle to moderate winds, a long period NW swell is being
observed in the coastal waters. The Bodega Bay Buoy is reporting
a NW swell of 16 ft at 17 seconds. After abating to 10 feet
Wednesday, significant wave heights will rebuild to very rough
from Thursday through Friday due to more incoming swell from a
storm force low pressure system in the Eastern Pacific.
