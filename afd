...New AVIATION...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 355 AM PDT Thu Sep 7 2023

Quiet weather this week with morning coastal clouds and afternoon
sun. Temps continue a gradual warming trend into the coming weekend.

&&

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 404 AM PDT Thu Sep 7 2023

Nighttime microphysics satellite imagery shows coastal stratus
redeveloping and moving inland on onshore winds. The marine layer
is moderately deep per profiler data showing the depth varying
from about 1700 to 2000 feet. Northwesterly winds are advecting
additional stratus southeastward along the coast. 4 am temperatures
are in the mid 50s to mid 60s.

Morning stratus will mix out back to the coastline by late morning.
Forecast highs today ranging from the mid 60s to 70 coast to the 70s
bays to the 80s to near 90 inland.

.LONG TERM...
(Friday through Wednesday)
Issued at 404 AM PDT Thu Sep 7 2023

Synoptic scale 500 mb high pressure system located over TX, NM and
northern Mexico slowly retrogresses, nudges southward and weakens
over the weekend and early next week. In response, expect a slow
warming trend in our cwa through the weekend, expect more widespread
90s far inland, however it`ll be cooler with onshore breezes at the
coast and near the bays.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 445 AM PDT Thu Sep 7 2023

Mix of MVFR-IFR with localized LIFR early this morning. Cigs will
start to lift later this morning then eventually mix out and VFR
will resume by 16-19z (later for coastal terminals such as KOAK,
KMRY). NW winds will increase this afternoon, becoming moderately
breezy then diminishing this evening. Moderate confidence on
extent of low cloud coverage tonight into Friday morning. Guidance
indicates less coverage tonight and later arrival of stratus,
which is likely due to expected further compression of the marine
layer and strengthening northerly (SFO-ACV) gradient tonight into
tomorrow, which will help keep surface conditions drier. Any cigs
that do form will be borderline MVFR-IFR.

Vicinity of SFO...MVFR conditions prevail over SFO terminal.
However, night fog satellite image shows thinner cloud coverage
over San Bruno, so could have intermittent SCT low clouds through
the morning hours. VFR expected after 17z with NW winds increasing
through the afternoon/evening. Low to moderate confidence of low
clouds returning over the terminal early tomorrow morning.

SFO Bridge Approach...Low clouds currently over SMB and expected
to clear between 16-17z this morning.

Monterey Bay Terminals...MVFR to borderline IFR cigs will persist
through the late morning. TEMPO included for IFR cigs. NW winds
will become breezy this afternoon with an early return of MVFR-IFR stratus
this evening between 02-04z.

.MARINE...
(Today through Tuesday)
Issued at 244 AM PDT Thu Sep 7 2023

Stronger winds will develop across the northern waters this
afternoon into the early morning hours Friday. More widespread,
breezy to gusty conditions will develop later this weekend into
early next week. In addition, several swell trains will continue
to propagate through the waters over the next several days,
characterized by a long period southerly swell and moderate period
northwesterly swell.

.MTR WATCHES/WARNINGS/ADVISORIES...

     evening for PZZ540.
