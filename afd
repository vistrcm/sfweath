...New AVIATION...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 445 AM PST Wed Nov 15 2023

Another round of rain with slight chances for storms expected
today with gusty winds. The full low pressure system moves over
land Friday, offering widespread showers and slight chances for
storms again. Rain chances reduce Saturday, but linger into
Sunday before dry weather returns.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 445 AM PST Wed Nov 15 2023

The next round of rain is making its way toward the coast, with KMUX
seeing some pre-frontal light rain and drizzle along the coast and
moving into the interior North Bay. Recent high-res model updates
show a slightly later time of arrival for the front, but the
forecast remains mostly on track. Rainfall amounts have been
adjusted in the overnight forecast package to account for the slower
passage. Additionally, expect increasing southerly winds through the
morning becoming breezy and gusty ahead of the front and during the
main rain band passage. The rain band loses structure as it moves
inland, resulting in unorganized showers becoming widespread into
the evening and overnight. Light rain lingers into Thursday
afternoon.

The overnight forecast package calls for the following rainfall
amounts between now and midnight tonight:

0.20" to 0.50": Interior San Benito co, Salinas Valley, Santa Clara
Valley, Interior East Bay, Interior North Bay, Southern Monterey bay

0.51" to 0.75": San Francisco, San Mateo Coast, Oakland, Coastal
Sonoma Co, East Bay Hills, San Mateo Co, Santa Cruz Co.

0.76" and Up: Santa Cruz Mtns, Big Sur Coast.

Higher elevations along the Big Sur Coast look to pass the inch mark
as will as the highest peaks in the Santa Cruz Mtns and Mt Tamalpais
in the North Bay.

Chances for storms increase into Thursday morning and linger into
the evening, bringing chances for locally higher rain amounts and
gusty winds.

.LONG TERM...
(Thursday through Tuesday)
Issued at 445 AM PST Wed Nov 15 2023

The parent low of Wednesday`s front begins to move inland early
Friday. Recent forecast updates have delayed the time of arrival as
higher resolution models begin to fall in range and capture the
momentum changes of this churning low. The current forecast calls
for showery and drizzly conditions through Thursday night and into
Friday morning then widespread showers and some chances for storms
through the rest of Friday. The low will collect additional moisture
from the south and push it into the Central Coast, resulting in
strong rain chances and increased rainfall. The main rain band looks
to spread across the CWA as the low center pushes into the CWA
calling for widespread showers and spotty areas of locally increased
rain amounts. Showers weaken Saturday but linger until early Sunday
morning. Rainfall from the Friday through Sunday time range is
forecasted to be the highest of the event. But the highest rain rates
(Friday afternoon into the evening) still look relatively moderate,
though locally higher rates could occur in storms.

Confidence for the end of the week system is increasing as model and
ensemble member agreement improves. There could still be some
adjustments made for the timing and the storm cell potential. Please
plan ahead and be sure to keep checking in on the forecast as it
develops.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 452 AM PST Wed Nov 15 2023

At this time, radar shows scattered showers pushing through much of
the region. Despite this, most terminals are not currently reporting
rain, but for KSTS. Conditions are currently VFR with mid level
clouds present as the next frontal system begins to approach. Winds
are expected to increase out of the S/SE ahead of this front to
become breezy to gusty in the morning, with rain chances then
beginning into the afternoon as the front pushes through. Beyond the
frontal passage and into the evening hours, winds begin to slowly
decrease to become moderate to light. For most terminals, rain
chances begin to diminish into the late night. VFR is expected for
the majority of the TAF period, though some hints at MVFR conditions
developing at KSFO and KSTS into the late night of Wednesday exist.


Vicinity of SFO...S/SE winds strengthen into the morning and early
afternoon to become breezy to gusty around 25 knots, with conditions
remaining VFR despite mid to high level clouds. Into the afternoon,
rain chances begin, and are expected to last through the late
evening. Winds decrease into the night but remain S/SE, with SCT low
clouds approaching the terminal towards 05Z. Some hints at brief
MVFR CIG development near 05Z exist, though at this time, highest
confidence is in maintaining VFR conditions.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...Current breezy SE winds at KSNS are
expected to continue, with both KSNS and KMRY becoming gusty into
the late morning to early afternoon, and winds turning to become
more S as opposed to SE. Winds then weaken into the nighttime hours
of Wednesday, though KSNS looks to remain breezy overnight. Rain
chances approach into the late afternoon to evening hours, then
diminishing into the early morning of Thursday. At this time, VFR
through the TAF period is expected, though mid to high level clouds
will continue to be present.

.MARINE...
(Today through Monday)
Issued at 445 AM PST Wed Nov 15 2023

Gale force southerly winds build across the waters as a strong
low level jet aligns with the coast. Rain conditions with chances

over the waters Thursday affect the area through the remainder of
the week, bringing periods of rain and isolated thunderstorms to
the region. Hazardous winds and seas are possible for small craft
operators at times so stay current with the latest forecast
