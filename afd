.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 1207 AM PST Sat Feb 8 2025

The GOES West night fog product shows mostly clear skies across the
Bay Area, with some patches of stratus over the Central Coast. The
clear skies are allowing enhanced radiational cooling, and
several inland areas are already in the 30s. As the temperature
drops to the dew point, the rate of cooling will likely slow
through the morning, although the air mass is also on a drying
trend, so this moderating effect won`t be as pronounced as
normal. Overall the observed temperature is matching the hourly
forecast well and the frost/freeze products remain unchanged.
After the sun comes up, the clear skies will allow temperature
will begin to climb, but we`ll only reach the mid-50s this
afternoon for most populated areas. Higher terrain won`t get out
of the 40s.

.LONG TERM...
(Sunday through Friday)
Issued at 1207 AM PST Sat Feb 8 2025

Why is it getting so cold? After all the deep air mass isn`t that
cold. The 850 mb temperature is only in the 10-25th percentile
this weekend. This cooling is driven more by dry air supporting
enhanced radiational cooling. As the surface dew points drop into
the 20s-30s under clear skies, there is nothing to slow down
nocturnal cooling. Lower level winds will shift to light offshore
Sunday, causing the air mass to dry further. The PWAT looks very
likely to drop below 0.2", which is in the bottom 2% for
February. This very dry air mass will continue to support clear
skies and very cold mornings through early next week. Sunday and
Monday look to be the coldest. Our official forecast brings
downtown San Francisco to 39 Monday morning. That mark is roughly
10 degrees below normal, and has only been reached 3 times in the
last decade (2/23/23, 2/24/23, 3/1/23). Meanwhile San Jose has a
60% chance of dropping below freezing for the first time since
2017.

Everything changes on Wednesday. The winds will shift from
northerly to southerly as low pressure system moves over the
Pacific Northwest. An associated warm front and cold front will
both push through California, bringing a prolonged period of
moderate to occasionally heavy rain that will linger into Friday.
The heaviest period currently looks to be from late Wednesday
through late Thursday, when 1-3" of rain is expected in the
lowlands with more in the coastal mountains. This will likely
cause some flooding issues for urban environments and smaller
streams. The USGS has also informed us that soil moisture sensors
are indicating shallow landslides are likely if the rain rates get
high enough. This system will also bring some wind, though with
the actual low pressure center much further north than the most
recent storm, the pressure gradient and wind potential are
somewhat lower. Things currently look to dry out Friday before a
dry weekend, but that`s not a guarantee as the uncertainty remains
high.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 327 AM PST Sat Feb 8 2025

Currently a mixed bag of LIFR-VFR at the terminals thanks to patchy
fog and stratus. High confidence in VFR prevailing by 17Z with the
help of daylight and northerly (drying) winds.

Vicinity of SFO...Currently VFR with northwesterly flow. High
confidence in VFR through the TAF period. Winds will prevail out of
the northwest today, veering to become offshore by early tomorrow
morning.

SFO Bridge Approach...Stratus is impacting the San Mateo Bridge
Approach, high confidence in it clearing by 17Z.

Monterey Bay Terminals...Currently VFR and calm at both terminals.
Moderate to high confidence in VFR through the TAF period; the
threat to VFR is stratus that has formed along the Monterey Bay
Coast and in the southern Salinas Valley. Winds will become
northwesterly by this afternoon. Onshore flow will prevail at SNS,
offshore flow will prevail through the morning for MRY before the
afternoon sea breeze kicks in with a return to offshore flow late
tonight.

&&

.MARINE...
(Today through Thursday)
Issued at 857 AM PST Sat Feb 8 2025

Strong northerly winds will prevail through Tuesday with the bays
remaining sheltered from the strongest gusts. Significant wave
heights will remain in the moderate to rough realm. An approaching
low will bring rain Tuesday night through Friday morning.
