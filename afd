...New AVIATION, MARINE...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 1203 AM PST Fri Feb 23 2024

Dry conditions anticipated into the start of the upcoming weekend.
Unsettled conditions return on Monday with the next rain chances
arriving towards the end of next week.

&&

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 1203 AM PST Fri Feb 23 2024

A low pressure trough aloft will remain offshore as a shortwave
ridge build across the area. This will bring rather benign conditions
to the region although we may still see some high level clouds and
perhaps some virga. Regardless the low to mid levels appear far too
dry for any surface precipitation. Temperatures will warm slightly,
with afternoon highs mostly in the mid to upper 60s away from the
immediate coast. Lows tonight will dip into the mid to upper 40s.

&&

.LONG TERM...
(Saturday through Thursday)
Issued at 1203 AM PST Fri Feb 23 2024

Mild temperatures will prevail on Saturday with even milder readings
expected. Expect highs to reach the 60s along the coast, with lower
70s for the warmest inland valleys.

Increasing clouds and stronger onshore flow will bring a cooling
trend on Sunday as the offshore trough encroaches on the region.
Highs should reach the lower to mid 60s, with overnight lows in the
40s.

A weak upper trough will progress through the region on Monday and
Monday night with some light precipitation. The best rain chances
will be south of the Golden Gate. Storm total amounts from this
system have decreased, and range from around 0.75" in the Santa
Lucias, to around 0.5" in the Santa Cruz Mountains. Amounts up to
0.25" are possible for inland portions of the Central Coast, with
Bay Area amounts generally 0.15" or less.

Quasi-zonal flow will prevail thereafter with the storm track
remaining north of the area. Rain chances creep back into the
picture by Thursday. More rain, potentially impactful, is expected
as we head into early March.
