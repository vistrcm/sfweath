...New SHORT TERM, LONG TERM, AVIATION, MARINE...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 951 PM PST Fri Jan 3 2025

Dry weather through the weekend with warmer temperatures expected
later next week. A High Surf Advisory remains in effect through
Saturday evening, with dangerous beach conditions.

&&

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 327 AM PST Sat Jan 4 2025

A progressive upper ridge is developing over NorCal in the wake of
the system that brought beneficial rain across our area on Friday.
Todays highs will be cooler than normal with most of our area
struggling to reach 60 degrees, under north winds and some lingering
low clouds in the morning, followed by high clouds in the afternoon.
Tonight will be seasonably cool with relatively light winds. Sunday
will start a trend toward warmer temperatures that will extend well
into the upcoming work week, as an amplified ridging pattern builds
over the West Coast. Highs on Sunday will be roughly 5 degrees
higher than today, under mostly sunny skies.

&&

.LONG TERM...
(Sunday through Friday)
Issued at 327 AM PST Sat Jan 4 2025

The extended forecast will be dry with warmer temperatures,
potentially well above normal for the second half of the upcoming
work week into next weekend. As ridging amplifies across the West
Coast, an `inside slider` system barrels south across California
from late Monday night through early Wednesday morning. An extended
period of offshore flow will bring dry conditions and warm
temperatures. The ECMWF EFI (Extreme Forecast Index) highlights the
North Bay and Bay Area especially, with warm and windy conditions
for the second half of next week. Can`t rule out a return of
marginal fire weather concerns, although most of the area
highlighted by the EFI has benefited from recent rainfall.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 327 AM PST Sat Jan 4 2025

Mostly VFR is expected to prevail with a drier airmass in the
post-frontal environment. Local FG impacts near KSTS will linger
through this morning, with a low chance of recurrence tonight into
Sunday morning. Otherwise quiet pattern with ample high clouds
across the region.

Vicinity of SFO...VFR is expected to prevail through the forecast
period. Winds will be mostly light with afternoon breezes out of
the northwest.

SFO Bridge Approach... Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...VFR is expected to prevail through the
forecast period with light to moderate west to northwest winds
continuing through the TAF period.

.MARINE...
(Today through Thursday)
Issued at 327 AM PST Sat Jan 4 2025

Rough seas with moderate westerly swell continue to produce
hazardous conditions for small crafts through early Sunday morning
with significant wave heights between 12 to 13ft. Seas ease
briefly during the remainder of the day on Sunday, then begin to
build again late Monday into the middle of next week.

&&

.BEACHES...
Issued at 1219 PM PST Thu Jan 2 2025

Wave model forecasts indicate long period westerly swell arriving
along the coastline from Sonoma County to Monterey County Friday
night, decreasing to a moderate period westerly swell Saturday. We
have issued a Beach Hazard Statement from 9 AM Friday to 9 PM
Friday due to increased risk for sneaker waves. Then, High Surf
Advisory from 9 PM Friday to 3 AM Sunday due to breaking waves of
18-25 feet (all coastal locations expect the northern Monterey Bay
which will remain in a Beach Hazard Statement).

Also at the current time, wave model forecasts are showing a newly
arriving long period westerly swell Monday into Tuesday. As always
whenever there is increasing surf - remember to never turn your back
on the ocean and stay out of the water. Again please stay tuned to any
further updates for late week, additionally for early next week.
