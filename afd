...New UPDATE, MARINE...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 309 AM PDT Thu May 8 2025

Warm and dry conditions through Saturday, unsettled weather Sunday
and into early next week.

.UPDATE...
Issued at 905 AM PDT Thu May 8 2025

The marine layer fog and stratus is eroding and retreating back to
the coast. The reported visibility has increased above 1 mile at
Santa Rosa, Petaluma, and Gnoss Field. Traffic cameras have also
shown improvement along the 101-corridor through the mid-morning.
As such, the Dense Fog Advisory for the North Bay Interior
Valleys has been allowed to expire as planned at 9 AM. We have two
main forecast challenges today. First is the temperature forecast
during the warm snap from Fri-Sat. This is particularly
interesting for the Southern Salinas Valley, where our current
forecast is right on the cusp of triggering enough HeatRisk to
justify a Heat Advisory. My concern is that our current forecast
may not be warm enough. Both the ECMWF deterministic and ensemble
based MOS data show 101 at Paso Robles on Friday, while Oxnard`s
forecast gets to 97. This is typically a decent proxy for the
southerly Salinas Valley in Monterey County (our responsibility).
On the other hand, up valley winds make it a bit trickier. King
City and areas north will likely get some marine air influence.
Regardless, there is a decent chance we will issue a Heat
Advisory after the next forecast update this afternoon. The
second challenge is rain on Monday. Our current forecast keeps
light rain confined to the North Bay, but there is a lot of
guidance coming in that shows up to 1/10th or more is possible
throughout our CWA. While this still isn`t terribly impactful, I
do expect a significant increase in both the POP and QPF forecast
this afternoon.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 309 AM PDT Thu May 8 2025

The Fort Ord profiler shows the marine layer being observed around
3,000 feet; however, satellite is modest given the depth (not
penetrating as far inland as it did last night with the same depth).
Satellite trends show stratus continuing to expand, but expect it to
be slower and less expansive than normal. Two reasons for this are:
high clouds from a dry cold front and downslope flow. Another
byproduct of this is temperatures are generally lower than they
were 24 hours ago due to less insulation. In fact, San Francisco
Downtown (SFOC1) will come close to its daily minimum temperature
record of 46 degrees set in 1999, the current forecast has the
official minimum temperature of 49 degrees occurring this morning.
Heights will rise today as the upper-level shortwave ridge builds
into the West. Subsidence aloft will allow for the marine layer to
compress and retreat towards the coast by this afternoon and only
impact coastal locations overnight. The warming trend continues
today with moderate HeatRisk in the Southern Salinas Valley and
minor HeatRisk elsewhere. Temperature wise this translates to
temperatures being around 10 degrees above normal away from the
immediate coast.

.LONG TERM...
(Friday through Wednesday)
Issued at 309 AM PDT Thu May 8 2025

Friday will be the warmest day of the week outside of interior
Monterey and San Benito Counties with moderate HeatRisk expected in
the Santa Clara Valley, East Bay Interior Valleys, and the Interior
Central Coast with minor HeatRisk elsewhere. Due to the orientation
of the upper-level shortwave ridge, Saturday will be the warmest day
of the week for interior Monterey and San Benito Counties with
moderate HeatRisk expected in this region as well as the East Bay
Interior Valleys with minor HeatRisk expected elsewhere. To put all
of this into context, all climate sites with the exception of San
Jose have experienced temperatures at or above what the official
forecast calls for so far this year either in late March or earlier
this month with no records in jeopardy. Heights begin to fall Sunday
as an upper-level low develops off the Pacific Northwest coast,
nudging the upper-level shortwave ridge to the east. Global
ensemble clusters diverge on solutions by Monday when 63% percent
show a solution with an upper-level low off the Pacific Northwest
Coast and 37% show an open wave somewhere over the West. Taking a
deeper dive into the individual ensemble means, the Canadian, ECMWF,
and GFS all show the same general pattern of an upper-level low off
the Pacific Northwest Coast becoming an open wave at some point
after it moves inland. The divergence comes in the digging, and thus
the timing. The ECMWF digs farther into the region and thus its
presence will be felt longer than the Canadian and GFS that only
dig into Northern California and thus are more progressive. As we
exit the wet season and enter the dry season, the greatest impact
from this system will be wind as our attention turns toward fire
weather. The ECMWF solution shows a northerly (drying) flow regime
while the Canadian and GFS show an onshore flow regime. Light,
beneficial rainfall is still on tap for the North Bay Monday.
Temperatures will also plummet to 10 to 20 degrees below normal
with the Oakland Museum (OAMC1) forecast to approach its daily
minimum temperature records of 47 degrees set in 1974 on Tuesday
and Wednesday, the official forecast is 50 degrees.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 430 AM PDT Thu May 8 2025

Interesting a somewhat tricky set up this morning with a slightly
abnormal marine layer due to a dry cold front washing out over the
Bay Area. Bay Area TAFs as a later arrival of cigs/fog, but most
terminals have cigs this morning. Cigs will lingering in the AM
rush, but then VFR by this afternoon. Central Coast TAF had early
arrival of cigs overnight with a deep push and clearing will be
later - 18-19Z. Tonight...morning compressed marine layer with
KMRY/KSNS primarily in the action. There`s a low chance(20%) for
some cigs at other terminals late tonight/early Friday. Onshore
flow kicks up this afternoon with gusts over 20 kt for KSFO.

Vicinity of SFO...Cigs continue to fill in over SF Bay. Will have
cigs clear 18-19Z. Gusts up to 25 kt this afternoon.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO. Solid cigs for the approach
with heights right around 1500 feet.

Monterey Bay Terminals...IFR through 18-19Z. Cigs return tonight,
but super late.

.MARINE...
(Today through Tuesday)
Issued at 905 AM PDT Thu May 8 2025

High pressure will build in from the north today and persist
through Saturday. As such, building high pressure will maintain
light to moderate northerly flow over the waters heading into the
weekend. Winds will be locally stronger north of Point Reyes and
along the Big Sur coast. Moderate seas continue through the end of
the forecast period.

     Small Craft Advisory from 3 PM this afternoon to 9 PM PDT this
     evening for Pigeon Pt to Pt Pinos 0-10 nm.
