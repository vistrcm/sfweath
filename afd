...New UPDATE, MARINE...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 245 AM PST Mon Nov 11 2024

Cold front moving through today brings beneficial rainfall across
the region this morning and early afternoon. Conditions become
quieter into Tuesday but remain cool...more rain on the way for
the latter half of the week.

.UPDATE...
Issued at 855 AM PST Mon Nov 11 2024

We`re keeping an eye on KMUX as the front moves through the North
Bay. Pre-frontal drizzle and showers have already reached the
Monterey Bay, and the front itself seems to be keeping its
momentum. The main rain band is entering the SF Bay and will
continue south and east into the afternoon.

The focus of the afternoon forecast package will be with the
lingering shower activity behind the front, of which looks to last
into the night. Additionally, some adjustments may be needed for
the post-frontal thunderstorm potential, or rather the reducing
potential. Then, of course, the mid-week overnight cooldown and
the next rainmaker. Just a whole lot of opportunity to add the
special blend of herbs and spices in the forecast. Be sure to
check in to see what we`ve cooked up!

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 245 AM PST Mon Nov 11 2024

Cold front currently draped across northern CA will continue to
makes its way south this morning. Deep, moist southwesterly flow
in the prefrontal environment has resulted in some early wins for
areas in the North Bay due to upslope enhancement of shallow rain
showers. A few locations in the North Bay coastal ranges have seen
between 0.1-0.2" so far this morning before the main front
expected by later this morning. For you radar watchers that may be
new to us or unfamiliar with our shallow rain processes...you may
not notice much on radar if you look during this early morning
across the North Bay. That`s because the rainfall process occuring
is nearly dominated by orographic ascent resulting in condensation
and collision-coalescence of droplets, rather than a deeper
process dominated by larger scale atmospheric motion. Since the
former process is very shallow, the ongoing rainfall as of writing
is almost fully underneath the radar beam. A quick check of the
S-band vertical profiler near Cazadero verifies this, showing a
dense concentration of small raindrops nearly all below about
5,000 feet, consistent with the shallow, warm rain process.

Some deeper echoes are starting to show up on radar across the
waters off of Mendocino county as the front nears. Expect heavier
rain to begin in the North Bay between 8-10AM, Bay Area 10AM-12PM,
and the Monterey Bay/Central Coast by about 12-2PM. It does appear
there is sufficient cooling aloft to result in weak instability
sufficient enough to produce a rumble of thunder or two across the
North Bay just behind the cold front during the late morning. It`s
a very low chance, but a chance nonetheless. However, a less-
than- stellar shear profile and a bit of convective inhibition
does not appear supportive of sustaining anything meaningful
beyond this low chance for some thunder. Rainfall totals by this
evening appear to be on track with recent forecasts, with perhaps
the slightest trend upwards, particularly in the coastal ranges.
The winners will likely come in between 0.5-0.7" in the coastal
high terrain, and mostly between 0.25-0.5" everywhere else, with
slightly lesser amounts for rain shadows and further south into
Monterey and San Benito counties.

.LONG TERM...
(Tuesday through Sunday)
Issued at 245 AM PST Mon Nov 11 2024

Tuesday, albeit cooler, looks like a wonderful day for an outdoor
farmer`s market if you have one near you, or to just enjoy the
fall-like weather doing something that brings you happiness. Have
your morning coffee or tea ready, because this is a good week for
it. Fairly high confidence in the forecast going into the middle
part of the week. Ensemble guidance continues to advertise a deep
upper low digging down the West Coast and bringing the next chance
for widespread rainfall by late Wednesday. With a bit of
displacement in the Pacific jet upstream of the trough axis as the
system evolves, it appears the Wednesday system may linger
through Thursday and potentially into Friday as well. This would
result in a prolonged soggy pattern and chilly temperatures into
this weekend with lows in the 40s, upper 30s for inland valleys.
As of now we`re not talking about flooding rainfall. This still
looks to be beneficial, but perhaps our first prolonged week of
solid moisture so far this season. The evolution of the active
pattern becomes a bit more fuzzy as we get into the weekend.
Cluster analysis does not paint a confidence enhancing picture in
this case, though what is apparent is that the trough pattern does
remain active through the next 10 days.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 437 AM PST Mon Nov 11 2024

Currently it`s MVFR-LIFR per latest surface observations, rain
continues to spread southeastward across the forecast area ahead
of a cold front just to our northwest. Expect IFR-LIFR conditions
and mountain obscurations in rain and fog with frontal passage
through morning and early afternoon. Showers diminishing in the
post frontal environment and winds shifting to northwesterly. For
tonight and Tuesday morning a few patches of fog /IFR-LIFR/ are
likely to develop.

Vicinity of SFO...Rain with MVFR-IFR ceilings and visibilities up
to cold frontal passage near 17z today. A few showers continuing
post frontal passage otherwise drier in to the afternoon. Westerly
wind increasing to near 15 knots in the afternoon and early evening.
VFR tonight and Tuesday morning.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...VFR-MVFR except lowering ceilings and
visibilities /MVFR-IFR/ through mid morning with the approaching
cold front from the northwest. Rain will develop during the morning.
Cold frontal passage is forecast during the early to mid afternoon,
a few showers lingering otherwise turning drier into the evening.
A few lingering low clouds otherwise MVFR tonight and Tuesday morning.

.MARINE...
(Today through Saturday)
Issued at 855 AM PST Mon Nov 11 2024

A cold front producing widespread rain will move southeastward
across the coastal waters and bays today. A moderate period
northwest swell will move through the waters early Tuesday to
early Wednesday. Another frontal system with rain approaches the
waters during the middle of the week. Significant wave heights
begin to build Monday night and continue to increase through the
middle of the week.
