...New UPDATE...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 323 AM PDT Wed Apr 9 2025

A ridge of high pressure across the west coast will result in mostly
sunny skies, above normal temperatures and light winds for the
second half of the work week, with minor HeatRisk concerns in the
afternoon.

&&

.UPDATE...
Issued at 821 AM PDT Wed Apr 9 2025

Visible satellite shows just a few clouds over the region this
morning which will allow for temperatures to rise efficiently
before onshore flow kicks in. Today will be the warmest day of the
week. We will be monitoring temperatures closely to see how the
NBM deterministic and probabilistic forecasts perform,
particularly along the coast.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 323 AM PDT Wed Apr 9 2025

Upper level ridging will continue to gradually amplify today,
steering high cirrus clouds to our north. The mostly sunny skies,
light winds and above normal temperatures will result in beautiful
weather area wide today. As the ridge axis shifts farther inland
tonight, a return of weak onshore flow and a weak marine layer will
bring a return to some stratus development along the coast tonight
into Thursday morning. There is minor HeatRisk associated with the
warm up the next few days, with no other impactful weather concerns
through the extended forecast.

&&

.LONG TERM...
(Thursday through Tuesday)
Issued at 323 AM PDT Wed Apr 9 2025

As the upper ridging pattern shifts farther inland a developing
trough in the Gulf of Alaska will struggle to dig far enough south
to influence weather around our area. The lower H50 heights and weak
backdoor cold front pushing south from the troughing to our north
will cool temperatures closer to normal for the weekend and the
remainder of the extended forecast. Expect dry conditions across our
whole area through the extended forecast with the exception of any
drizzle along the coast from weak marine layer development.
