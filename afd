...New AVIATION, MARINE...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 104 AM PDT Sun May 5 2024

Isolated post frontal showers will continue through Sunday morning
with decreasing intensity. While the next couple days will be
chilly, a gradual warming trend will bring temperatures above
normal by the end of the week.

&&

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 104 AM PDT Sun May 5 2024

The cold front has been quite progressive over the last 24 hours
and is now near the CA/Mexico border. The cold air left behind
has brought the 1000-500 mb thickness into the mid 530 dm range.
This will cause surface temperatures to drop into the low 40s for
most areas away from the immediate coast or bay shore. This cold
air is also causing some instability, with the low level lapse
rates around the conditionally unstable threshold of 6.5 C/km. As
such, isolated showers are expected to continue through the
morning. The cold air is also drier, and by mid-day there will not
be enough moisture to support convection.

.LONG TERM...
(Monday through Saturday)
Issued at 104 AM PDT Sun May 5 2024

A significant warming trend is in store this week as an upper
level ridge forms over the Eastern Pacific. As an example, the
high temperature at Santa Rosa on reached 58F on Saturday and is
expected to reach 84F by Thursday. A marine layer will likely
develop under the high pressure and keep coastal areas cool,
although the low-level moisture doesn`t seem to support
significant fog or stratus coverage. Overall, it will be a nice
week with increasing temperatures and plenty of sunshine.

Issued at 427 AM PDT Sun May 5 2024

Isolated rain showers will continue through the morning before dry
conditions return. Moderate northwesterly breezes will prevail
through tomorrow. Northerly winds will become strong on Tuesday

the Eastern Pacific Ocean builds and moves east. Significant wave
heights will begin building on Monday, posing hazardous
conditions for small craft through Thursday.
