...New MARINE...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 127 PM PDT Mon Apr 15 2024

Dry conditions are here to stay with a gradual warming trend through
midweek, peaking on Wednesday and/or Thursday. Onshore flow
increases toward the end of the week; cooling temperatures near the
coast as marine stratus returns.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 1238 AM PDT Tue Apr 16 2024

A high pressure ridge aloft will center off the California coast
with low-level ridging locating across the northeast Pacific. As
lower pressures develop inland this will bring a modest pressure
gradient and light onshore (N-NW) winds today. Given the ridging
influence temperatures inland will warm into the 70s this afternoon
with 60s along the coast. Readings tonight will drop into the upper
40s to lower 50s.

&&

.LONG TERM...
(Wednesday through Monday)
Issued at 1238 AM PDT Tue Apr 16 2024

The upper ridge will gain prominence on Wednesday and Thursday
bringing milder temperatures to the region. High in the warmer
inland valleys will top out in the upper 70s to lower 80s, with 60s
to around 70 along the coast and bays.

The ridge will flatten thereafter in response to a weak perturbation
translating through the mean westerly flow with stronger onshore
flow and cooler temperatures. The ridge looks to rebuild by early
next week with a slight warming trend. However onshore winds will
keep things cooler by the coast. Dry conditions will prevail.
