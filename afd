.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 1236 AM PST Sat Nov 11 2023

Pleasant weather through the weekend before persistent rain
arrives next week.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 1204 AM PST Sat Nov 11 2023

High clouds associated with a low amplitude perturbation to our
north were spilling into the Bay Area early this morning. These
clouds will continue to drift south through the region today but
with plenty of afternoon sunshine still around. A shortwave ridge
will build into the region later today into tonight bringing quiet
weather and dry conditions to the Bay Area and Central Coast. Might
see a bit of patchy valley fog within the North Bay but otherwise
not really much going on in the weather department for this period.
High temperatures should be seasonally pleasant, and in the upper
60s to mid 70s for most areas away from the immediate coast and
bays. Lows tonight will drop into the 40s for most areas; except
near 50 along the coast and some upper 30s in far southern
Monterey County.

.LONG TERM...
(Sunday through Friday)
Issued at 1236 AM PST Sat Nov 11 2023

Sunday and Monday:

Sunday will stay dry with seasonal temperatures. Cloud cover will
begin to increase, but there should still be periods of mostly
sunny skies in the afternoon. Winds will remain light. By Monday,
the much anticipated gale force low pressure system will
migrating south from the Gulf of Alaska to the Eastern Pacific
waters a couple hundred miles west of California. This system will
bring increasing cloud cover and southerly wind. The rain will
most likely hold off through at least the daylight hours on
Monday, and should start overnight into early Tuesday morning.

Tuesday through Friday:

As the low pressure system occludes, it will slowly meander from
the waters off the Bay Area to Southern California, staying about
500 miles off the coast for most of the week. This set up will
bring southerly flow that should pump a persistent source of
moisture to coastal California. Once the rain starts Tuesday
morning, it is expected to continue (off-and-on) through Friday.

There has been some buzz today about the decreasing rainfall
forecast, with a couple runs of some deterministic global models
backing way off to roughly 1/2" of total accumulation in low-
lying coastal areas. Despite this, the official forecast hasn`t
changed too drastically, with closer to 2" predicted for these areas.
The rational lies with the difference between the deterministic
QPF and ensemble mean QPF. As a whole, the GEFS and ECMWF
ensembles show similar results, with a wide spread in
accumulations ranging anywhere from 1/2" to 3 or 4" for most
areas, including San Francisco and the East Bay. The ensemble mean
is obviously somewhere in the middle, at about 2". Interestingly,
the deterministic 00Z GFS and ECMWF models are near the lowest
10% of ensemble members. In other words, there is just as much
chance of getting 3" (90th percentile) as there is chance of
getting 1/2". Clearly the fact that the deterministic model is on
the low end does not paint the whole picture. With this much
uncertainty, chasing every deterministic run could lead to drastic
changes in the forecast, which seems unnecessary as the ensemble
means have been surprisingly stable.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 243 AM PST Sat Nov 11 2023

VFR outside of a small potential (10-15%) for shallow fog
development within the North Bay valleys late tonight into Sunday
morning. Offshore drainage winds this morning will turn onshore
this afternoon with speeds under 10 kt.

Vicinity of SFO...VFR. Light onshore flow late this afternoon and
evening.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO

Monterey Bay Terminals...VFR. Light offshore drainage winds this
morning will become onshore this afternoon and evening.

.MARINE...
(Today through Thursday)
Issued at 1204 AM PST Sat Nov 11 2023

Moderate to fresh northerly breezes are anticipated for the outer
waters into tonight. This will combine with northwest swell to
produce elevated seas thus resulting in hazardous conditions for
small craft operators. These hazardous continue will likely
continue within the northern outer waters into Sunday. Winds turn
southerly by early next week as a strong low pressure system
brings rain, hazardous winds and seas, and the potential for a few
thunderstorms from mid to late next week.
