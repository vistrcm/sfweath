...New AVIATION, MARINE...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 252 AM PDT Tue Sep 5 2023

Quiet weather this week with morning coastal clouds and afternoon
sun. Temps continue a gradual warming trend into the coming
weekend.

&&

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 252 AM PDT Tue Sep 5 2023

Mostly clear skies overnight with some patchy stratus showing up
early this morning along coastal areas. Expect clear skies across
the region today with some hints of stratus along the immediate
shoreline. Afternoon highs today at or slightly below normal.
Upper 70s to 80s inland, 60s to lower 70s coastal.

&&

.LONG TERM...
(Wednesday through Monday)
Issued at 252 AM PDT Tue Sep 5 2023

Persistent trough pattern continues through the week with gradual
height rises into the weekend as a strong high pressure ridge over
TX/NM slowly pushes westward. This will promote a slight warming
trend through this week, with high temps at or slightly above
average by the weekend. Areas along the coast hang on to the
marine influence, as usual, and remain near seasonal normals.
Hottest temps of the forecast period currently look to be at the
start of next week with inland areas in the 90s.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 512 AM PDT Tue Sep 5 2023

Stratus cover this morning continues to be sparse, with few
terminals reporting ceilings at the time of this writing. North Bay
and Monterey Bay terminals reporting MVFR/IFR conditions this
morning due to fog and reduced visibilities are expected to clear to
VFR towards 17/18Z. Elsewhere, expecting VFR conditions to persist
through this morning and at least the late evening of Tuesday, with
the first hints of stratus making a return towards the mid morning
of Wednesday near 10-12Z. Otherwise, light winds this morning
increase into the late afternoon to become breezy and onshore around
10-15 knots, with gusts up to 20 knots near coastal gaps.

Vicinity of SFO... VFR conditions continue through to the late night
of Tuesday for KSFO. Low clouds may develop becoming FEW-SCT, but
generally not expecting CIG development for KSFO this morning.
Current satellite imagery shows patchy stratus continuing to linger
near the KOAK terminal, so have left the MVFR CIG group for now,
though generally expecting stratus to mix out towards the late
morning. Winds onshore and gusting up to 20 knots into the
afternoon, weakening into the night.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...LIFR conditions expected to persist through
at least 15Z, though expecting an ebb and flow between LIFR and VFR
conditions as has been the trend overnight for KMRY. That being
said, clearing towards the late morning expected to VFR, winds
onshore in the afternoon around 8-12 knots. Timing for stratus and
reduced ceilings return into the evening is uncertain, though at
this time, leaning towards lowered MVFR/IFR ceilings developing in
the mid morning hours of Wednesday near 11Z.

.MARINE...
(Today through Sunday)
Issued at 512 AM PDT Tue Sep 5 2023

Northwesterly winds continue, diminishing through the day in the
outer waters and along coastal jet regions, becoming strong to
moderate breezes. Winds continue to be elevated and gusty in the
far northern outer waters despite diminishing elsewhere. As a
result, steeper wind waves are expected through midweek which may
pose hazardous conditions for small craft. Many swell trains are
moving through the coastal waters, including two longer period
southerly swells and a moderate period northerly swell.

.MTR WATCHES/WARNINGS/ADVISORIES...
CA...None.
PZ...Small Craft Advisory until 9 AM PDT this morning for PZZ565.

     Small Craft Advisory until 9 AM PDT Wednesday for PZZ570.
