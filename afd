...New AVIATION...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 245 AM PDT Thu Jul 6 2023

Seasonably cool temperatures will persist for much of the upcoming
week. Night and morning low clouds clearing to the coast each
afternoon will also continue. Building high pressure will bring
warmer temperatures to the region early next week.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 245 AM PDT Thu Jul 6 2023

Rinse and repeat kind of pattern at the moment with below normal
temperatures and a solid marine layer. A passing upper level
shortwave trough to the north helped the marine layer deepen
2,500-3,000 feet overnight. Satellite fog product shows even more
inland coverage of stratus compare to 24 hours ago. Clouds will
once again erode inland, but linger along the coast today. Given
the deeper marine layer the erosion of the clouds will be slightly
later than previous days (late morning). Even with some inland
sunshine today, the cooldown noticed Wednesday will continue
today. Highs will max out in the upper 50s/60s coast/bays and 70s
to upper 80s inland, which is still 5 to 15 degrees below normal.

Marine layer will begin its inland push this evening with solid
coverage again tonight.

.LONG TERM...
(Friday through Wednesday)
Issued at 318 AM PDT Thu Jul 6 2023

No real big change in the daily sensible weather through at least
Saturday. Night/morning clouds clearing to the coast each
afternoon will be common. Daytime highs will remain below seasonal
averages with cool overnight lows. Still eyeing the passage of an
upper level low over SoCal/Central Coast on Sunday. This low may
be enough to disrupt the marine layer and bring temps up a few
degrees.

Confidence continues to increase for a more distinct change with
the weather pattern early next week. Long range guidance
(deterministic/ensembles/WPC clusters) all point to a warming
trend with Excessive Heat returning to portions of CA. A large
upper level ridge of high pressure currently locked in over the
Desert SW will shift westward. The initial push will begin Tuesday
and persist through much of next week. Pattern recognition
suggests this round of heat will be hotter and more widespread
than the last round of heat. Details will become more clear as the
event nears, but as of now CPC has highlighted the southern half
of CA for Excessive Heat with Moderate (40%) confidence.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 505 AM PDT Thu Jul 6 2023

Upper level troughing has helped to deepen the marine layer. As of
this time, the marine layer sits between 2500 and 3000 feet, much
deeper than seen in previous days. Nighttime satellite imagery shows
stratus reaching far inland beyond the immediate coastal regions:
down the Salinas valley, and over much of Sonoma, Contra Costa,
Santa Clara, and Alameda counties. As a result, many locations have
seen MVFR-IFR CIGs through much of the night, and will continue to
do so through the late morning hours. Late morning to early
afternoon clearing to VFR for most terminals is expected, before
stratus creeps back in around the early evening hours of Thursday.
Winds increase into the afternoon to become onshore and gusty near
coastal gaps, with sustained speeds of around 10-15 knots. Winds
decrease slowly into the night as stratus makes an early return for
most terminals.

Vicinity of SFO...MVFR CIGs expected to last through the late
morning to early afternoon today. Late clearing to VFR is expected,
with stratus making an early return in the evening towards 03Z.
Winds onshore around 12-15 knots in the afternoon, gusting to 25
knots occasionally.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO with a slightly earlier retreat
of the stratus.

Monterey Bay Terminals...IFR CIGs lasting through the late morning,
with clearing to MVFR. MVFR conditions expected to last through much
of the day. If clearing does occur, it is expected to brief in the
late afternoon before CIGs return. Currently, highest confidence is
in stratus and MVFR conditions persisting through the day, until IFR
conditions return in the early evening. Winds breezy in the
afternoon around 13 knots, decreasing to become light in the late
evening.

.MARINE...
Issued at 852 PM PDT Wed Jul 5 2023

Strong to near gale conditions from the Northwest will develop
Thursday and last into the weekend as high pressure builds over
the eastern Pacific. Gusty afternoon and evening winds also
develop each day into the weekend over the San Francisco Bay
waters and Delta. Longer period southerly swell and shorter
period northwesterly swell continue through the week before a new
southerly swell arrives Friday.
