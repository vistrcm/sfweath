.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 113 AM PST Thu Dec 28 2023

Key Messages:

* High Surf Warning for all Pacific coastlines from 3 AM Thursday to
  3 AM Friday due to breaking waves up to 28-33 feet.
* Stay out of the water, and off of jetties, piers, and rocks!
* Coastal Flood Advisory along the Pacific coast through 3 AM
  Friday, and on the San Francisco Bayshore from 10 AM to 1 PM today.
* Next rain system arrives Friday into Saturday, rain totals of 2-3"
  with isolated 5" in the coastal ranges and 0.5-1.5" inland.
* Widespread strong southerly winds on Friday with gusts generally
  to 20-30 mph, up to 40-50 mph along the coast and at ridgetops.
* Active pattern continues for the first week of the new year.

Radar imagery shows that showers have moved out of the forecast
area, and conditions are expected to remain generally dry for the
rest of the night. Preliminary rain data as of midnight suggests
that, as expected, the North Bay received the most rain with 0.5-
1.5" reported across the North Bay valleys, with up to 3" reported
across the North bay coastal ranges and Santa Cruz mountains. The
rest of the Bay Area and Central Coast generally received up to 0.25-
0.5". Some key station rain totals (as of midnight) include: 2.92"
at the Austin Creek station in the Sonoma coastal ranges, 2.68" at
the Venado HADS station, 1.45" at the Sonoma County Airport, 0.32"
at the Napa County Airport, 1.78" at the Middle Peak RAWS station
(Mount Tamalpais), 0.17" at downtown San Francisco, 0.27" at the
Oakland Museum, 0.07" at Livermore Airport, 0.01" at San Jose
International Airport, 1.75" at the Ben Lomond RAWS station, 0.41"
at Watsonville Airport, 0.55" at Monterey Airport, 0.06" at Salinas
Airport and 0.43" at the Big Sur RAWS station.

With the first batch of rain past us, attention now shifts to the
incoming very high swell from a low pressure system in the north
Pacific. A High Surf Advisory will go into effect, and a Coastal
Flood Advisory is already in effect, for all Pacific coastlines
until 3 AM Friday, due to incoming swell up to 25 feet in open
water, translating to breaking waves up to 28-33 feet along west-
facing beaches, with breaking waves up to 40 feet at favored
locations. These are conditions that can challenge even the most
experienced surfers and are life-threatening for those near the
water. This is not the time to go to the beach!! Everyone should
remain off jetties, piers, rocks, or other waterside infrastructure
due to the risk that these high waves could sweep people into the
water. Separately, a Coastal Flood Advisory will also come into
effect for the San Francisco Bayshore and the North Bayside coast
from 10 AM to 1 PM today, due to high astronomical tides and local
surges. High tide will peak at 10:46 AM today with water levels at
7.0-7.5 feet above MLLW at the San Francisco tide gauge, resulting
in minor coastal flooding for low-lying, flood-prone spots adjacent
to the San Francisco Bay.

Highs today will rise into the mid to upper 60s in the Bayshore
regions, the Santa Clara Valley, and the Central Coast valleys. The
North Bay should see highs in the upper 50s to the lower 60s, while
coastal regions see highs in the low to mid 60s, with higher
elevations seeing low to mid 50s. Low temperatures will generally
hover in the low to mid 50s, perhaps down into the mid to upper 40s
in the most interior locations. Scattered showers are possible
through the day, especially where orographic lift enhances cloud
formation. Given the expected southerly flow, this will generally be
areas to the north of the coastal ranges.

.LONG TERM...
(Friday through Wednesday)
Issued at 113 AM PST Thu Dec 28 2023

The next widespread rain system comes through the area on Friday,
associated with a frontal system that is expected to directly impact
the California coast. The system is now coming into the view of high
resolution models, which currently depict pre-frontal showers on
Friday morning before the main rain band comes through mid-day
through the evening, with post-frontal showers continuing overnight.
Significant rainfall is expected to be more widespread with this
system, with the coastal ranges expected to receive around 2-3" of
rain, with isolated locations expected to reach 5" of rain, while
the interior sees rain totals of 0.5-1.5". Another period of breezy
to gusty southerly winds is expected on Friday before the front
moves through, with gusts of 20-30 mph generally expected across the
region, with gusts up to 40-50 mph at the coast and the ridgetops.
The frontal system also brings a slight chance of thunderstorms (20-
30% probability), generally concentrated in the post-frontal
environment overnight Friday into Saturday morning.

Another system is set for the period around New Year`s Eve and New
Year`s Day (Sunday and Monday), but this system is expected to pass
far to the south, and only fringe impacts are expected even for
areas as far south as Los Angeles and San Diego. Therefore, the next
storm of concern comes towards the middle on next week, with another
frontal system set to bring some rain to the area. Early indications
are that it might not be as wet as the Friday`s system, but the
exact forecast is yet to be refined. Global ensemble models are
hinting at yet another system to come through for the first full
weekend of the new year, but details on this system are even fuzzier.
As always, stay tuned for future forecast updates as these systems
get closer.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 348 AM PST Thu Dec 28 2023

A mix of MVFR CIGs, overcast mid-level clouds, and inconsistent
pockets of mist will affect the area through the morning. While
areas to the south and east see some lifting of the CIGs, SFO and
the North Bay will struggle to lose MVFR conditions. Winds turn from
southeasterly to southerly and south westerly during the day before
becoming light into the night. SNS offers moderate southeasterly
drainage winds in the late night.


Vicinity of SFO...MVFR lasts into the afternoon. Light winds
increase in afternoon, becoming moderate and southerly and last well
into the night. MVFR CIGs will return mid Friday morning.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO

Monterey Bay Terminals... Mid-level affect the area through the TAF
period but CIGs and moments of reduced visibility from mist will be
inconsistent. MRY sees light winds turn southerly in the afternoon,
while SNS sees Southeast winds turn variable in the afternoon before
turning southeast again overnight.

.MARINE...
(Today through Tuesday)
Issued at 348 AM PST Thu Dec 28 2023

A storm force low is pushing inland to the north of the waters.
The seas generated by this system are estimated to be up to 45
feet in the offshore waters. As this swell propagates eastward,
it will arrive in the coastal waters as 20-25 ft swell. Strong
southerly winds return on Friday and sea heights will remain
hazardous for small craft through the weekend.  Gale warnings are
in effect for all unprotected zones, with small craft advisories
active in the Monterey and San Francisco Bays.

&&

.BEACHES...
Issued at 348 AM PST Thu Dec 28 2023

A High Surf Warning is in effect through 3 AM PST Friday. Expect
hazardous wave conditions with breaking waves 28 to 33 feet and
localized beach erosion. Large waves can sweep across the beach
without warning, pulling people into the sea from rocks, jetties
and beaches. These large waves can be erratic and unpredictable.
The larger swings of the tidal cycle will contribute to the beach
risks.

Remain out of the water during the High Surf to avoid hazardous
swimming conditions. Use extra caution near the surf zone as
these large waves will be capable of sweeping people into the
water. Avoid rocks and jetties. Avoid steep beaches. Stay much
farther back from the water and never turn your back on the ocean.
