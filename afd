...New SHORT TERM, LONG TERM, AVIATION, MARINE...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 247 AM PDT Thu Jun 22 2023

Breezy afternoon winds today, but lighter overall compared to the
past few days. Cloud cover increases as another upper level low
deepens through today bringing chances of coastal drizzle Friday
morning. Below normal temps persist through early next week with
hints at normal temps by mid next week.

&&

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 247 AM PDT Thu Jun 22 2023

Satellite showing patchy stratus coverage across the area as the
marine layer continues to moisten under an onshore flow regime.
Upper low centered over central coastal CA will deepen through
today, further expanding the marine layer into tonight, leading to
more widespread stratus coverage and patchy drizzle along coastal
locations through late tonight. Temps remain below seasonal
normals, yet pleasant with upper 50s to lower 60s along the coast
to upper 60s to lower 70s elsewhere.

&&

.LONG TERM...
(Friday through Wednesday)
Issued at 247 AM PDT Thu Jun 22 2023

Long term pattern still favors troughing through the forecast
period with below normal temps and onshore flow. However, gradual
warm up expected beyond this weekend into the middle of next week,
supported by ensemble cluster analysis. Confidence is increasing
in seeing high temps near normal by the middle of next week. Once
again, not much change to the long term pattern aside from inching
closer to lessening the grip of the trough pattern and getting
temps closer to normal.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 432 AM PDT Thu Jun 22 2023

Mostly MVFR conditions across the area tonight, but some isolated
VFR and IFR also in the mix tonight. Winds are generally
southwesterly tonight and will prevail through the TAF period as
an upper level low pressure system moves inland today. Winds will
increase this afternoon with gusts up to 25 knots across the
region. With upper low moving inland, expecting marine layer to
deepen, leading to higher confidence of widespread MVFR cigs and
patchy drizzle near the coast tonight into Friday morning.

Vicinity of SFO...The last few hours has seen some localized
drying effects from downsloping winds from southwest flow. As
such, VFR prevails but tempo included for MVFR cigs through 17z
today as low clouds linger on the northern and western peripheries
of the terminal. Low to moderate confidence if cigs move back
into terminal this morning, so will continue to monitor and remove
tempo if needed. W/SW winds become breezy this afternoon with
gusts up to 25 knots possible. Timing of low cloud intrusion
tonight is more uncertain, but could be as early as 04z.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...MVFR cigs will persist for much of the
TAF period, with only brief clearing to VFR tomorrow afternoon.
However, there is still a high chance that low clouds don`t clear
and MVFR cigs persist. If clearing occurs, MVFR cigs return
tomorrow evening. SW winds will prevail for KMRY tomorrow,
becoming occasionally gusty in the afternoon. W/NW winds expected
for KSNS.

.MARINE...
Issued at 247 AM PDT Thu Jun 22 2023

Northerly winds continue to diminish across the outer waters.
Generally lighter west winds expected today and tomorrow, but
will become breezy through Golden Gate and Delta during the
afternoons. Gusty northerly winds return this weekend, becoming
widespread and lasting into early next week as pressure gradient
across the eastern Pacific strengthens. Longer period southerly
swell continues, with moderate period northwesterly swell
expected through the remainder of this week.

&&

.MTR WATCHES/WARNINGS/ADVISORIES...

PZ...Small Craft Advisory until 9 AM PDT this morning for PZZ530-570.

     Small Craft Advisory from 3 PM this afternoon to 9 PM PDT this
