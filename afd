.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 105 AM PST Sat Mar 8 2025

Dry conditions and seasonal temperatures continue through the
weekend. Light showers possible on Monday before impactful rainfall
arrives Tuesday night through Thursday.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 105 AM PST Sat Mar 8 2025

Satellite imagery shows another night of generally clear skies and
patches of coastal stratus near Point Reyes and along the San Mateo
Peninsula. Some expansion of stratus is possible tonight across the
Bay Area coast and the San Francisco Bay. Otherwise skies remain
clear, contributing to chilly lows across the inland valleys. A
Frost Advisory is in place until 9 AM for the southern Salinas
Valley and mountains of interior Monterey and San Benito Counties
with low temperatures in the lower to middle 30s. Otherwise, lows
this morning will range from the upper 30s to lower 40s inland and
the middle to upper 40s at the coastal regions.

Another day of clear skies and light winds is expected as upper
level ridging continues over the region. High temperatures will
reach the upper 60s to near 70 across the inland valleys, the upper
50s to the lower 60s along the coast, and the lower to middle 50s
along the higher elevations.

.LONG TERM...
(Sunday through Friday)
Issued at 105 AM PST Sat Mar 8 2025

Upper level ridging continues into Sunday with forecast high
temperatures similar to today. Unsettled weather does return to the
state on Monday, but the models are now trending towards greater
impacts across southern California and Baja California, as the
cutoff low is expected to travel further south. As it is, rainfall
accumulation on Monday and early Tuesday is limited to a few
hundredths of an inch in the Santa Lucias, with showers and drizzle
possible elsewhere in the Central Coast and coastal San Mateo
County. It`s still possible for the low to take a more northerly
track and bring relatively more rainfall to the region, but the
impacts would still be relatively light. Even the higher end
precipitation estimates, where there is only a 10% probability that
rainfall totals end up higher than the estimates, only rise to
around a quarter to a half of an inch in the Santa Lucias.

More impactful rainfall is expected from later Tuesday into Thursday
with a stronger upper level trough, which spins off a trough located
in the Gulf of Alaska. How deep the trough gets will determine the
magnitude of the impacts. Ensemble cluster analysis reveals that
scenarios with a "flatter", shallower trough bring less rain to the
region while scenarios with a deeper trough enhance the rainfall
potential. Without enough confidence in a specific scenario, opted
to retain the NBM forecast for the Tuesday-Thursday system, which
calls for rain totals generally 1-2 inches across the region and up
to 4 inches in the coastal ranges. These rain totals can still
fluctuate as the details of the incoming trough come into better
focus. Continue to check back in the coming days as the forecast
evolves.

Ensemble models are picking on more storm systems coming in after
the Tuesday-Thursday storm moves out, with the details still very
unclear. Think of longer range forecasting like trying to see a
mountain from far away; you can make out that something`s there,
but the details are very hazy and unclear. As you get closer to
the mountain, you`re able to pick out more details until you get
close enough to notice (or stand in the middle of!) all the finer
details. It`s the same principle with weather modeling, with
distance in time standing in for distance in space; as a result,
forecasts for storms within the next couple of days are more
accurate than those for systems that are a week or more away. For
the time being, our colleagues at the Climate Prediction Center
state that over the 8-14 day outlook (March 15-21), the region
leans towards temperatures below seasonal averages and
precipitation totals near or above seasonal averages.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 309 AM PST Sat Mar 8 2025

Currently VFR at all terminals with the exception of HAF which is
getting impacted by an IFR ceiling from a small patch of stratus
along the San Francisco Peninsula Coast. High confidence in VFR
through the TAF period. Winds will be diurnal and light through the
TAF period.

Vicinity of SFO...Currently VFR with southerly flow. High confidence
in VFR through the TAF period. There`s a patch of stratus along the
San Francisco Peninsula Coast, but it should be too shallow to make
it through the San Bruno Gap. Winds will be light and diurnal
through the TAF period.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...Currently VFR with drainage flow at both
terminals. High confidence in VFR through the TAF period. Winds will
be light and diurnal through the TAF period.

.MARINE...
(Today through Thursday)
Issued at 309 AM PST Sat Mar 8 2025

Moderate seas and winds will prevail through Tuesday. Hazardous
conditions return Wednesday in the form of rough to very rough
seas, a strong southwesterly breeze with gale force gusts, and
moderate rainfall.

&&

.MTR WATCHES/WARNINGS/ADVISORIES...
CA...Frost Advisory until 9 AM PST this morning for CAZ516-518.
