...New AVIATION...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 316 AM PDT Wed May 31 2023

Night and morning low clouds remain through at least midweek.
Onshore flow will also keep cooler temperatures and breezier
winds through Wednesday. A warming trend is forecast for the end
of the week that could potentially return temperatures back to
seasonal norms over the weekend.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 325 AM PDT Wed May 31 2023

Overnight satellite imagery is starting to be a broken record -
widespread clouds over the coastal and spreading across much of
the inland terrain (not just valleys). Similar to the last fews, a
cloudy and cool start to the day with patchy fog possible. Dense
fog is less likely due to the deeper marine layer 2,000 plus feet.
One subtle change today will be max temperatures. An upper level
low that has been parked over SoCal will slowly shift eastward
today. In its wake, 500mb heights and 850mb temps will rise. As a
result, a slight warming trend will occur. Coastal areas will
still hold onto some residual cloud cover so temperatures will
remain cooler, but inland areas will see a more noticeable warming
trend. Highs will be upper 50s to 60s coast and 70s to lower 80s
far interior.

For tonight - do expect another push of marine layer clouds, but
building high pressure will compress the depth of marine layer.
Not as much coverage and increased chances for patchy fog.

.LONG TERM...
(Thursday through Tuesday)
Issued at 333 AM PDT Wed May 31 2023

The building ridge of high pressure gets tempered on Thursday as
a weak upper level shortwave passes through NorCal. As such, the
warming trend from Wednesday will take a pause on Thursday -
expect similar temperatures. Building high pressure gets back on
track Friday and next weekend. The building high pressure will
further compress the marine layer, but lingering onshore flow will
keep it in place. Night/morning clouds clearing back to the coast
each afternoon will be the norm. The warmest day of the bunch
will be Sunday with temperatures warming above seasonal averages
across the interior. Coastal areas on the other hand will remain
at or below seasonal levels. Highs for the weekend will be 60s to
lower 70s coast and 80s to lower 90s. While temperatures do warm
up, Heat Risk concerns still remain in the minor category for the
weekend. Cooler weather return early next week as an upper low
forms off the coast and drifts toward SoCal. Ensemble guidance has
decent agreement with the upper low forming, but confidence is
less for placement and strengthen. A few of the deterministic
models do generate precip Sunday night and Monday, but less on
ensemble guidance. Highest confidence on the extended will be
cooler temperatures, but lower confidence on actual precip.
Something to watch over the next few days.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 509 AM PDT Wed May 31 2023

Stratus continues to linger around this morning allowing for
North Bay terminals to experience IFR ceilings, but mostly MVFR
prevails throughout our region. High confidence that stratus will
start to mix out and dissipate near the late morning for all
terminals. Moderate confidence that MVFR conditions will return
tonight as persistence forecast suggest lower cigs, but a few models
suggested VFR prevailing for the remainder of the TAF period. The
weather pattern do not show any drastic changes as compared to the
last 24 hours, therefore, the end of the TAF period were heavily
influenced by persistence forecast. Onshore winds will become
moderate to breezy as we move into the late morning/early afternoon
with chances of gusty winds in the SF Bay and Monterey Bay terminals
in late afternoon/early evening. Lower confidence on gusty winds
near Monterey Bay terminals, therefore it was not included in the
TAFs.

Vicinity of SFO...MVFR ceilings as stratus stays socked in over the
SF Bay area. Expect clearing to start late this morning but expect
MVFR to return tonight. Low confidence on timing of the return of
low ceilings, as persistence forecast and some Hi-Res models suggest
earlier timing than 11Z. WSW winds are expected to become gusty up
to 25 KT late this morning.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...MVFR conditions with a chance of IFR
ceilings, therefore a tempo was placed. Winds show a S/SW component,
but are expected to become mostly westerly and wind speed are
expected to get up to 14-15 KT this afternoon. Some models suggested
gusty winds in the afternoon, but had low confidence to include in
the TAFs.

.MARINE...
(Tonight through next Sunday)
Issued at 840 PM PDT Tue May 30 2023

Northwest winds building through Wednesday creating steeper wind
waves. Strong winds continue through the week with gale force
gusts possible in the outer waters. Meanwhile, a mix of northwest
and southerly swells prevail through the week.
