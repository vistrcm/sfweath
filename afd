...New AVIATION, MARINE...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 248 AM PDT Wed Aug 9 2023

Seasonably cool temperatures will persist through Friday. Mid-
level moisture associated with the remnants of former Tropical
Cyclone Eugene will approach the region later Wednesday into
Thursday. Small rain chances are possible for the Central Coast
but confidence is low. High pressure and warmer temperatures
return over the weekend into early next week.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 248 AM PDT Wed Aug 9 2023

Overnight satellite fog product looks very similar to 24 hours
ago...solid marine layer along the coast pushing to the inland
valleys. Profilers put the depth 2,000-2,500 feet. The persistent
marine layer is thanks to cool waters along the coast, persistent
northwest flow, trough overhead with an embedded shortwave
trough. The added shortwave overhead combined with ample low level
moisture is leading to more widespread drizzle along the coast
this morning, especially from the Marin Headlands to the Monterey
Peninsula. A few buckets have already tipped a few hundredths. Do
expect some patchy fog as well along the coast through the
morning hours. Low clouds/fog will lingering through the morning
hours before eroding back to the coast. Despite some inland
sunshine temperatures will be seasonably cool once again. In fact,
very similar to yesterday with inland highs in the 70s and 80s.

One notable change from earlier forecasts for Wednesday was the
removal of showers/thunderstorms for southern Monterey/San Benito.
The general trend over the last few model runs was to delay the
influx of upper level tropical moisture and linked instability.
As it looks now, tonight will start off very similar to the last
few nights - coastal stratus moving inland with patchy drizzle
developing. As the night progress, steering flow aloft switches
to more southerly advecting higher PWATs into the Central Coast
late Wednesday night. Will still keep tonight dry (outside of
coastal drizzle) with increasing mid-high level clouds.

.LONG TERM...
(Thursday through Tuesday)
Issued at 347 AM PDT Wed Aug 9 2023

Two main weather impacts for the Long Term:low end chance for
thunderstorms and inland heat.

Thunderstorms: The increasing upper level tropical moisture is
still most pronounced on some of the CAMs, where global guidance
is less robust with some guidance shunting moisture E of the
region Thursday into Friday. Given some of the uncertainty and
lower confidence only made minor tweaks to ongoing forecast. A
slight chance for thunderstorms (15%) will be possible over
southern Monterey/San Benito Thursday. Moisture profiles in the
area still show a rather dry mid-level leading to more dry than
wet thunderstorms initially on Thursday. Obviously, dry
thunderstorms would pose a fire weather concerns, but confidence
is not high enough to warrant any fire weather headlines at this
time. Do feel convective chances increase through the day with
daytime heating and better upper level support as an upper level
low develops. Even less confident on solutions for Thursday night
into Friday as an upper level low develops over the Central Coast
as more upper level moisture spreads farther north.
Deterministic/ensemble guidance has now hinted at scattered
showers spread as far north as SF Bay. Not thunderstorms per se,
but a few showers nonetheless. If this trend continues showers
may be introduced into the forecast Thursday night and Friday as
the NBM is currently dry.

Any precip chances diminish by Saturday, but a few mid-high level
clouds will be possible as the upper low wobbles around the
Central Coast.

Temperatures: Inland warmup develop Sunday into next week with
rising 500mb heights and warming 850mb temperatures. Temperatures
well interior will once again reach the triple digits. Heat Risk
concerns return to Moderate levels as well.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 451 AM PDT Wed Aug 9 2023

Stratus has many terminals under MVFR ceilings this morning, and
is expected to last through the late morning hours of Wednesday
before clearing to VFR near 18Z for most terminals, later for
Monterey Bay. VFR lasts through the day with stratus returning in
the late night tonight, to early morning hours of Thursday.
Current light winds increase through the day to become breezy to
moderate around 10-15 knots.

Vicinity of SFO...VFR continues through much of the TAF period.
Return of stratus and ceilings in the evening is uncertain,
though greatest confidence is in the development of SCT clouds
towards the late evening. Winds increase this afternoon to become
breezy to moderate around 15 knots, then weakening into the night
to become light.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...MVFR-IFR conditions last through the
late morning to early afternoon, then becoming VFR as stratus
mixes out. Winds increase into the afternoon to become breezy
around 10-12 knots. An early return of stratus and MVFR-IFR CIGs
is expected towards 2Z for KMRY, and slightly later for KSNS,
lasting through the night.

&&

.MARINE...
(Today through Monday)
Issued at 451 AM PDT Wed Aug 9 2023

Fresh to moderate northwest winds continue, with gusty conditions
expected to develop over the San Francisco Bay and Delta in the
afternoon, then diminishing into the night. Moderate period
(12-16 seconds) southerly swell continues through much of the week
and will gradually increase into late week, in addition to short
period wind waves. A new light northerly swell train develops
towards Thursday. A few showers are possible mid to late week,
especially over the southern waters.
