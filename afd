...New SYNOPSIS, SHORT TERM, LONG TERM, AVIATION, MARINE...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 328 AM PST Sat Dec 30 2023

Post cold frontal showers will linger into this afternoon. A few
additional showers developing Sunday and Sunday evening then drier
by midnight New Year 2024. Dry weather on New Year`s Day. Otherwise
due to large, long period swell along the coast, a high surf warning
including a coastal flood warning remain in effect until 2 PM PST
today.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 359 AM PST Sat Dec 30 2023

A healthy cold frontal system has pushed through across the forecast
area preceded by warm air advection, wind shear and a water vapor
tap from the subtropics. Both 500 mb height trough and thermal
trough are presently moving in from the west, corresponding to
300-700 j/kg surface based convective available potential energy
(CAPE) and minimal (over land) to no (over coastal waters) surface
convective inhibition especially 5 am to 8 am this morning on
recent high resolution rapid refresh model. Sea surface temp
anomalies are running 3F-4F above Dec normals, the in-situ surface
heat and water vapor fluxes adding to the potential energy for
air parcels. In short expect additional post cold frontal showers
through mid to late morning, and the trough may still produce a
lightning strike or two. Flood advisories for the main rain band
have since ended.

There`s large, long period swell along the coast. A high surf
warning including a coastal flood warning remain in effect until 2
PM PST today. High surf advisory criteria may still occur later
on today; the day shift will revisit this during the day.

For later today and tonight, scattered to widely scattered showers
will gradually end in our forecast area. The aforementioned 500 mb
trough will have moved east to the Sierra Nevada crest, replaced
by a surface to 500 mb high pressure ridge i.e. dry weather. Any
clearing tonight will quite likely result in fog late tonight and
Sunday morning due to recent rain. Best chances of clearing will
be underway earlier in the night compared to late night since by
then high clouds from the next upstream trough will be arriving
here.

.LONG TERM...
(Sunday through Friday)
Issued at 359 AM PST Sat Dec 30 2023

Due to the momentum of the upstream westerlies across the Pacific,
the next upstream 500 mb trough and southward digging jet stream
dynamics will send this trough toward southern California and
Mexico early next week. Since the 500 mb trough will be in
proximity to our forecast area Sunday and Sunday evening it`ll
temporarily bring a chance of light showers during this time.
There`s essentially no lower level warm air advection with this
trough rather it`ll be an elongating 700-500 mb cold pool of air
and weak instability approaching our forecast area from the west
and southwest, more on a trajectory toward southern California and
Mexico. Measurable precipitation will be minimal Sunday, maybe a
few hundredths of an inch.

Drier weather returns by midnight New Year 2024 and it`ll stay
dry on New Year`s Day. From New Year`s Day into Tuesday morning a
500 mb ridge of high pressure will keep dry weather going here.

Then the next upstream (over the Pacific) 500 mb trough to approach
our forecast area with rain and wind later Tuesday and Wednesday
will move to the south and east, driven by the polar jet stream,
passing by a nearly stationary low near the Aleutian Islands. This
500 mb trough will attempt to, but not really completely become a
composite or merged low upon approach to the west coast from
northern California to the Pacific Northwest next week. There`s
good model agreement (within scope of 5 days) that this low will
draw upon an elevated water vapor tap from the subtropics, however
upon arrival here per GFS forecasts accounting for mid-latitude
drier air mixing in, maxing at ~ 0.80" precipitable water, just
below the 90th percentile in early January Oakland upper air
climatology. Nonetheless, with the arrival of this surface and 500
mb low it should bring a decent soaking rain to our forecast
area. There may another chance of rain late next week, however the
polar and subtropical jet streams across the Pacific become much
more sharply split and convoluted by then, therefore reducing
forecast confidence in the late next week timeframe.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 346 AM PST Sat Dec 30 2023

A mix of MVFR and IFR conditions across the region with light to
moderate southerly winds. The main rain band has moved out of the
region but light occasional showers will continue until the
afternoon. Terminals will start to see VFR conditions as the rain
diminishes. Models suggest MVFR conditions returning for most
terminals tonight, as well as LIFR visibility for North Bay
terminals overnight, but confidence is moderate. Winds are
expected to transition more westerly but will remain light to
moderate through the TAF period.

Vicinity of SFO...MVFR conditions currently, but visibility has been
alternating between 4-5SM to 2SM. With low confidence, IFR
conditions were not included in the TAFs but still is possible to
occur as showers move closer to the terminal. Southerly winds will
transition to a more westerly to northwesterly direction in the
afternoon with wind speeds up to 12 knots. Models suggest at MVFR
ceilings Sunday morning but confidence is moderate at this moment.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...MVFR conditions with light to moderate
southerly winds. VFR conditions is expected to return in the
afternoon with winds moving towards a westerly direction. Expect
MVFR conditions to return overnight.

.MARINE...
(Tonight through next Wednesday)
Issued at 346 AM PST Sat Dec 30 2023

A heavier rain band from the storm system has moved eastwards but
light showers may still occur over the waters. Winds will continue
to shift back to NW this morning. Another round of a large swell
today will create hazardous sea heights for small craft. Waves
are on a building trend, and will likely reach 17-19 ft before
gradually abating Saturday afternoon through Sunday. The next
storm looks to bring gale force winds and very rough seas to the
coastal waters on Wednesday.

&&

.BEACHES...
Issued at 905 PM PST Fri Dec 29 2023

A Coastal Flood Warning and High Surf Warning are both in effect
through 2 PM Saturday. Large breaking waves will contribute to
coastal flooding, especially during the high tide hours of 11 AM
through 1 PM.

After somewhat of a reprieve Friday, large breaking waves will
return tonight and persist through Saturday. The breaking waves
are not expected to be quite as high as Thursday, but will still
be well above normal and the beaches will once again be dangerous.
Expect breaking waves of 28-33 ft and localized beach erosion.
Large waves can sweep across the beach without warning, pulling
people into the sea from rocks, jetties and beaches. These large
waves can be erratic and unpredictable. The mid-day hours (11 AM
through 1 PM) will be particularly dangerous as the high surf
rides on the high tide. As we saw Thursday, this is the most
likely time for sneaker waves and coastal flooding.

Remain out of the water during the High Surf to avoid hazardous
swimming conditions. Use extra caution near the surf zone as
these large waves will be capable of sweeping people into the
water. Avoid rocks and jetties. Avoid steep beaches. Not all waves
have the same energy. Stay much farther back from the water and
never turn your back on the ocean.
