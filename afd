...New UPDATE, MARINE...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 328 AM PDT Wed Oct 9 2024

The heat wave has ended, though temperatures will still run around
five degrees above normal inland today. Temperatures for locations
near or along the coast will be closer to normal as the marine layer
begins to recover from its week long hiatus. The gradual cooling
will continue into the weekend, with more widespread cloud cover
inland and light rain chances late Friday through late Saturday.

.UPDATE...
Issued at 908 AM PDT Wed Oct 9 2024

Stratus coverage continues over the North Bay valleys, the city of
San Francisco, the Bayside East Bay, the Monterey Bay region and
the Salinas Valley. Mixing out continues through the morning
hours. Later tonight into Thursday, high clouds will come through
the region will move over the region as an upper level low
approaches the region. Forecast is still on track for continued
cooling through the next few days.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 328 AM PDT Wed Oct 9 2024

Whats left of the ridge influence over our area that brought the
record heat wave over the past week will unceremoniously shift south
today as more pronounced onshore flow returns under quasi-zonal flow
aloft today. Inland locations will still be above normal as H85
temperatures (~20C) are at or slightly above the 90th percentile for
this time of year. Cloud cover will become more widespread beginning
tonight, first along the coast but eventually spread inland tomorrow
as the deepening low to our west works its way toward NorCal. With
the mix of sun and clouds, and cooler airmass, highs on Thursday
will mostly be right around normal area wide.

&&

.LONG TERM...
(Thursday through Tuesday)
Issued at 328 AM PDT Wed Oct 9 2024

Cloud cover increases further on Friday across our region out ahead
of closed upper low marching our way on Friday. The position of the
low as it approaches the California coast late Friday into early
Saturday has shifted a little north from previous runs.
Unfortunately the shift north will bring some of the potential
rainfall with it. The North Bay Hills are most favored for only
light precipitation beginning as early as late Friday night, with
totals expected to be under a tenth of an inch in our area. Most
inland locations will remain dry, while coastal areas (from the Bay
Area south to Monterey Bay) will see drizzle and fog develop during
the overnight and early morning hours late Friday into Saturday. The
synoptic pattern for the beginning of next week hints at
temperatures climbing above normal as upper level ridging builds
over our area in the wake of the exiting low passing to our north
over the weekend.
