.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 152 AM PDT Mon Oct 30 2023

Dry conditions, light offshore flow, and warm temperatures today,
with highs generally slightly above seasonal averages for the rest
of the week. Light rain possible in the North Bay for the second
half of the work week, with more widespread rain chances this
weekend.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 152 AM PDT Mon Oct 30 2023

The only things blocking the view of our region on satellite imagery
are bands of high cirrus clouds mainly offshore, although with
several passing over the North Bay and East Bay. Winds are
remarkably calmer than this point last night with gusts of generally
25 to 30 miles per hour reported across the Mayacamas. Tonight`s
lows will range from the mid 30s to low 40s in the interior valleys,
to the upper 40s to mid 50s along the Bayshore, at the coast, and in
the higher elevations. Of note, with a continuing offshore component
to the general wind pattern aloft, conditions will continue to be
quite dry for the next couple of days, especially inland and at
higher elevations. People should continue to be cautious and avoid
any activity that could accidentally start a fire. For example, do
not operate machinery such as power tools or lawn equipment over dry
grass, and do not drive over dry vegetation.

Winds will be calmer throughout the region today, with the region
under the influence of two competing wind systems: the synoptic
level northerly offshore flow, and the more local sea breezes.
Current forecast thinking is that the interior parts of the region,
including areas to the east of the Berkeley Hills, will remain in an
offshore pattern while the sea breeze comes into the Bayshore and
the Sonoma, Santa Clara, and Salinas Valleys. Highs today will be
slightly above the seasonal averages, with the inland valleys up to
the mid to upper 70s, the coastal and Bayshore areas seeing highs in
the low 70s, and coastal regions and higher elevations perhaps into
the mid to upper 60s.

.LONG TERM...
(Tuesday through Sunday)
Issued at 152 AM PDT Mon Oct 30 2023

Tuesday and Wednesday:

An amplified flow pattern will initially be in place aloft with high
pressure centered along the West Coast. With time the ridge will
flatten in response to upstream troughing approaching from the
Pacific. This will bring quiet weather conditions and mild daytime
temperatures to the region. Highs will reach the 70s away from the
coast each afternoon with a few of the warmer inland spots likely
touching the 80 degree mark on Tuesday and Wednesday. With cool and
dry conditions prevailing expect overnight lows to remain on the
chilly side with readings mainly in the upper 30s and 40s inland.
Coastal and Bayside locations should generally remain in the lower
50s.

Thursday through Sunday:

The upper flow pattern will deamplify and become increasingly
progressive heading into early next week. The storm track will
initially focus to our north across the Pacific Northwest, but the
jet stream looks to dip equatorward closer to NorCal by this
weekend. The first in a series of low amplitude perturbations looks
to approach NorCal and the Pacific Northwest on Thursday into
Friday. While the bulk of the richer moisture and deeper lift
appears to target far NorCal, recent deterministic model runs and
their ensembles are more optimistic about rain potential across the
North Bay. Several GEFS members now project a wetting rain at Santa
Rosa during this time, while around 1/3 of the ECM members are on
board with this scenario. Another wave or two looks to roll through
the region this weekend bringing a renewed chance for wetting rains
to more of the Bay Area. Rain chances and confidence skew towards
the lower end (20-30%) through Friday, increasing to 30-50% by this
weekend. So while there`s still time for this portion of the
forecast to come into better focus it might be a good idea to make
sure you have that umbrella handy.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 419 AM PDT Mon Oct 30 2023

High confidence for VFR at the terminals through the TAF period. If
any stratus does form through the morning hours, it will be along
the immediate coast of the North Bay and in particular the Bodega
Bay-Point Reyes area. Light winds build to a gentle flow this
afternoon before diminishing again in the evening. Winds will be
onshore in the interior regions and generally onshore closer to the
coast.

Vicinity of SFO... VFR through the TAF period. Light winds through
the morning, then gentle northwest flow at up to 10 knots resumes
this afternoon, diminishing again in the evening.

SFO Bridge Approach... Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals... VFR through the TAF period. Gentle valley
drainage flows continue through the morning, turning onshore this
afternoon before diminishing again in the evening.

.MARINE...
(Today through Saturday)
Issued at 419 AM PDT Mon Oct 30 2023

Light to moderate northerly winds are expected across the coastal
waters early this week as high pressure resides over the region.
Light, moderate period westerly swell and long period, light
southerly swell will persist. A new moderate period northwest
swell train arrives by late week.

&&

.FIRE WEATHER...
Issued at 152 AM PDT Mon Oct 30 2023

As mentioned in the previous fire weather update, the Red Flag
Warning was allowed to expire last evening as offshore winds have
diminished below Red Flag criteria. However, elevated fire danger
continues for the next couple of days as humidity recoveries remain
weak away from the coastal regions. Tonight`s maximum relative
humidity values come up to 20-40% across the higher elevations and
much of the interior valleys, while daytime relative humidities
continue to hover around the 10-30% range away from the immediate
coast. Dry conditions continue through the next few days as upper
level ridging continues over the area, so continued vigilance is
necessary until the latter part of the week, when a pair of storm
systems will bring rain and moisture to the region.
