.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 259 AM PDT Mon Mar 11 2024

Surface cold front continues to slowly progress through the Bay
Area, bringing light to locally moderate rain. Cold front will lose
steam as it moves south into the Central Coast, resulting in lighter
accumulations south of the Santa Cruz Mountains during the early
morning hours today. Dry weather is expected through midday
today, but will be short-lived as another transient upper level
wave is expected to graze across the N Bay later today. This means
another shot of rain before the anticipated dry spell begins.

Light rain may start as early as this afternoon across the N Bay
under warm air advection regime, but the main push will be later
this evening as the cold front approaches tonight into Tues
morning, when rain will spread south to the rest of the Bay Area.
Light accumulations are again expected with
