...New SYNOPSIS, SHORT TERM, LONG TERM, AVIATION, MARINE...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 325 AM PDT Mon Jun 12 2023

Near to below normal temperatures will prevail throughout midweek
followed by a slight warming trend into the upcoming weekend,
especially across the interior.

&&

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 325 AM PDT Mon Jun 12 2023

Widespread low clouds once again impact the region this morning
with favorable onshore flow and a marine layer around 2,500 feet
in depth. In addition, west to southwest flow and deep moisture in
the boundary layer will result in more widespread drizzle in the
favored windward side of the local terrain through the morning. As
such, many of these areas are expected to pick up a few
hundredths of an inch of precipitation. Additionally, the
mid/upper level low centered over southern Nevada will continue to
advect moisture counter-clockwise over the region. This will
result in more widespread mid/high level clouds moving from east
to west across the region. CAMS and other high-resolution models
indicate a low probability (~10%) of high-based rain showers
and/or sprinkles moving across the Bay Area through midmorning.
That said, the drizzle potential appears to be the greatest chance
of measurable precipitation this morning (again only a few
hundredths of an inch or so).

For the remainder of the day, conditions begin to dry out as the
aforementioned mid/upper level system weakens and shifts farther
inland. Low clouds will retreat to the coast while passing mid/high
level clouds persist through the day as well. Temperatures this
afternoon will range from the upper 50s to mid 60s near the coast
with low to upper 70s inland. Confidence is high for the return of
low level clouds again tonight, yet the wind/moisture profile
appears a bit less favorable for widespread drizzle overnight with
the exception of the Santa Cruz region.

.LONG TERM...
(Tuesday through Sunday)
Issued at 325 AM PDT Mon Jun 12 2023

Drier conditions are anticipated for the remainder of the week
with a slight warming trend across the interior as we head into
late week. This will occur in response to ridging aloft nosing
into northern California while troughing prevails over southern
California and the Desert Southwest. While we see a bit of warming
late in the week, temperatures will only rebound to near-normal
while a persistent marine layer will maintain cooler and cloudier
conditions near the coast each afternoon. By the weekend,
confidence is increasing for the ridge axis aloft to drop
southward over central California. This would bring even warmer
interior temperatures for by the upcoming weekend with widespread
by Saturday. However, longer range guidance suggests the warming
trend will be short-lived with troughing once again developing
over much of the West Coast.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 325 AM PDT Mon Jun 12 2023

Widespread MVFR and isolated IFR ceilings this morning with high
clouds also streaming over the region from east to west making it
difficult to determine the spatial extent of the stratus. Where
VFR conditions do persist, there is medium confidence (30-50%
probability) for a brief period of MVFR ceilings to develop
through about 15Z. Otherwise, look for low clouds to dissipate and
scatter by 17-19Z with the exception of coastal areas where low
clouds may linger through much of the day. Onshore winds will
increase this afternoon to around 10-15 knots and persist through
the early evening. Winds again diminish late this evening along
with the gradual return of MVFR-IFR ceilings that will persist
into early Tuesday morning.

Vicinity of SFO...MVFR ceilings have been slow to develop with
medium confidence (30-50% probability) for the development over the
terminal between 12-17Z. Beyond this time, stratus will scatter and
give way to VFR conditions throughout the afternoon and evening.
Southwest winds increase to around 12 knots by 21Z before
diminishing around or after 04Z. Medium confidence for MVFR ceilings
to return by around 09Z Tuesday.

SFO Bridge Approach...Lower confidence(10-30% probability) for
ceilings across the approach through 17Z. Otherwise, similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...Generally MVFR ceilings persist with a low
confidence (10-30% probability) for brief IFR conditions through
17Z. Ceilings lift and scatter around 18Z for KSNS and slightly
later for KMRY. Winds increase to around 12 knots by 20-22Z before
diminishing by early evening. Medium to high confidence(60-80%
probability) for an early return of MVFR conditions between 00-03Z
Tuesday that will then persist through the end of the TAF period.

.MARINE...
(Today through Saturday)
Issued at 325 AM PDT Mon Jun 12 2023

Northerly winds diminish over the northern outer waters while
becoming west to southwest elsewhere early this week. Westerly
winds will accelerate through the Golden Gate into the Delta this
afternoon and evening resulting in hazardous conditions for small
crafts. Winds generally remain light through late week before
strengthening from the northwest by the upcoming weekend. Moderate
period mixed swells will also persist throughout the week.

&&

.MTR WATCHES/WARNINGS/ADVISORIES...
CA...None.
PZ...Small Craft Advisory from 3 PM this afternoon to 9 PM PDT this
     evening for PZZ530.
