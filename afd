.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 310 AM PDT Sun Jun 11 2023

Near to below normal temperatures will prevail throughout the
middle of the upcoming week. Isolated showers and thunderstorms
are also expected, mainly over the Central Coast and the North Bay
today and Monday with drying conditions thereafter. An inland
warming trend is also expected for the latter half of the week.

&&

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 310 AM PDT Sun Jun 11 2023

The mid/upper level low that brought isolated convection across
the Central Coast yesterday is currently pushing inland over
southern California. As such, deeper moisture aloft continues to
advect counter-clockwise around the cut-off low and across the San
Francisco Bay Area and Central Coast. Isolated rain showers that
continued into the early morning over coastal waters off of the
Monterey County coast continue to dissipate. Meanwhile, deep
moisture in the boundary layer is resulting in widespread low
clouds and patchy drizzle this morning. As the day progresses,
look for low level clouds to dissipate and retreat to the coast
while mid- to-high level clouds persist. This should allow for
temperatures to be similar to yesterday, upper 50s to mid 60s near
the coast with 70s inland and across the interior. Again, the
region`s warmest inland spots have about a 20-40% probability of
reaching 80 deg F (mainly southern and interior Monterey/San
Benito counties and far North Bay). While convection will be less
widespread today, there remains a 10-20% probability of afternoon
showers/thunderstorms to develop over interior San Benito County
and far northern Napa County as the upper level low continues to
spin over southern California.

As the aforementioned system begins to push farther east,
southwesterly flow will develop near the surface. This will aid in a
higher probability of drizzle overnight tonight and into early
Monday morning. Would not be surprised to see many of the favored
upslope regions picking up a few hundredths of an inch as a result.

.LONG TERM...
(Monday through Saturday)
Issued at 310 AM PDT Sun Jun 11 2023

Short-range CAMS and high-resolution models continue to indicate
a 10-20% probability of light rain showers over the North Bay and
potentially as far south as the Bay Area Monday morning before the
aforementioned system shifts farther inland. Thus, may see
isolated rain showers into the first half of Monday which may also
coincide with patchy drizzle. Otherwise, drying conditions are
expected heading into late Monday and Tuesday. Weak ridging is
forecast to build into northern California by mid-to-late week
which would allow for a slight warming trend across the interior.
However, the latest deterministic trends are for another cut-off
low to develop once again off of the southern California coast. As
such, there is still considerable uncertainty regarding its
influence on the region. Regardless, look for continued near to
below-normal temperatures through the week along with a more
compressed marine layer bringing widespread coastal stratus inland
each night/morning with more sunshine across the interior during
the afternoon hours.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 455 AM PDT Sun Jun 11 2023

Areas of midlevel cloudiness continue to stream through from the
east to southeast, but less extensive than same time early
Saturday morning. Therefore have a much better look at extent of
low cloudiness in the IR fog product satellite imagery. Stratus
coverage is now widespread around the bays and has extended well
into the valleys. All terminals are presently reporting MVFR to
IFR ceilings (LIFR at KSTS). Clearing on Sunday looks to be just a
bit later than seasonally typical morning times, other than the
Monterey Bay terminals where at best not likely until the
afternoon.

Vicinity of SFO...MVFR CIGs now well-established, and expect will
persist through Saturday morning. Clearing looks to be delayed
until around midday. Seasonally typical moderate west winds will
develop during the afternoon.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...IFR CIGs now established at KMRY and
lower-end MVFR CIGs at KSNS. Expect both will persist through the
night and well into the day on Saturday.

&&

.MARINE...
(Today through Friday)
Issued at 239 AM PDT Sun Jun 11 2023

Moderately strong and gusty northwest winds will persist over the
northern outer waters through tonight, with lighter winds
elsewhere. Generally light southwesterly winds are then expected
to spread across the waters on Monday as a weak low pressure
center develops offshore.

&&

.MTR WATCHES/WARNINGS/ADVISORIES...
CA...None.
PZ...Small Craft Advisory from 2 PM this afternoon to 9 PM PDT this
     evening for PZZ530.

     Small Craft Advisory until 3 AM PDT Monday for PZZ570.
