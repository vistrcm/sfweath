 - Warming and drying trend kicks off Thursday with the return of
   above normal temperatures

.SHORT TERM...
Issued at 216 AM PST Sun Feb 22 2026
(Today and tonight)

A storm force low pressure system off the Pacific Northwest Coast
and surface high pressure in the Intermountain West will continue to
tighten the pressure gradient. As a result, strong southerly winds
with gusts up to 40 mph can be expected along the Pacific Coast and
in the higher terrain. The attendant cold front to the
aforementioned low will be close enough to generate pre-frontal rain
showers. No adverse impacts are expected from them and they are
expected to remain confined to the North Bay with drizzle possible
for locations to the south. Temperatures will rebound to near
seasonal normals.

.LONG TERM...
Issued at 216 AM PST Sun Feb 22 2026
(Monday through Saturday)

A developing gale force low pressure system off the Northern
California Coast will bring tropical moisture along with it on
Monday. ECMWF and GEFS ensemble mean IVT forecast peaks in excess of
500 kg/ms on Tuesday with PWAT values expected to break the daily
record. Even though the moisture content is expected to be rich, the
dynamics are expected to be poor. The reason is due to the pattern
that we are in with ridging to our southeast and troughing to our
northwest - this will force the low up and over us into the Pacific
Northwest. This leads to high confidence that the North Bay will
receive the highest rainfall accumulations. Southwest facing terrain
will have locally higher totals with the help of orographic lift and
a perpendicular moisture fetch from the tropics off to the
southwest. Adjacent valleys will experience the rain shadow effect.
Impacts wise, flooding of low-lying, poor drainage, and urban areas
will be possible, especially in the North Bay. Ponding and slick
roadways will be likely. If rain rates get intense enough, shallow
landslides will be possible, especially in the North Bay. IVT values
will quickly decrease after peaking, with only light rainfall
expected Wednesday morning with the cold frontal passage. A warming
and drying trend commences on its heels with upper-level shortwave
ridging building across Baja California, resulting in temperatures
10 degrees above normal by next weekend.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 308 AM PST Sun Feb 22 2026

VFR throughout the region with some mid- to high level cloud cover.
Isolated to scattered showers will intrude into the North Bay
through the TAF period, with low to moderate confidence in an
extension of shower coverage down the western side of the San Mateo
Peninsula through the day. Southerly flow will increase in the
afternoon and evening, but is not expected to be as strong as
yesterday`s winds with gusts of 15-20 kt. Some MVFR ceilings are
possible in the North Bay valleys and the immediate coast tonight
into Monday morning, with moderate confidence on the timing and
extent.

Vicinity of SFO... VFR with mid- to high level clouds through the
TAF period. Southeast flow will continue through the day, with winds
remaining at a gentle breeze. Showers may develop this morning on
the west side of the San Bruno gap but confidence in impacts to the
terminal itself is very low. Overnight, winds will diminish with a
low to moderate confidence of MVFR ceilings developing on Monday
morning.

SFO Bridge Approach... Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals... VFR with some mid- to high level clouds
across the region and through the TAF period. Breezy drainage flow
persists through the morning at SNS, with winds turning
northwesterly in the afternoon hours before diminishing in the
evening. Some MVFR ceilings are possible tonight, but low confidence
in impacts at the terminals and have opted to take the ceilings
out of the TAF.

.MARINE...
(Today through Friday)
Issued at 308 AM PST Sun Feb 22 2026

Southerly winds and seas will decrease through the day. Rain
chances continue across the northern waters today, then spread
farther south Monday night through Tuesday night. Winds and seas
increase Tuesday then begin to ease by Wednesday of next week.
