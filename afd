...New UPDATE, MARINE...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 317 AM PST Fri Feb 21 2025

Dry weather is on tap for much of the region for the foreseeable
future. A few light showers might skirt the northern portion of
Sonoma or Napa counties on Sunday into Monday. Otherwise, look for a
warming trend through the forecast period.

.UPDATE...
Issued at 853 AM PST Fri Feb 21 2025

Satellite imagery shows a pulse of mid- to high level clouds
clearing the South Bay and moving through the Central Coast, with
the rest of the Bay Area generally clear. The forecast for a dry,
mostly sunny day with light winds remains on track with no changes
at this time.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 317 AM PST Fri Feb 21 2025

A brief period of upper level ridging passes over northern CA on
Friday, leading to another warm and dry day. High temperatures for
Friday generally look to be about 3 to 7 degrees above normal
interior areas, while communities near the coast are near normal or
a few degrees below. That means high temperatures will be in the mid
60s to low 70s for interior valleys, while areas near the coast or
that are at higher elevations range from the mid 50s to mid 60s.
Upper level ridging becomes more zonal Friday night into Saturday,
as a weak shortwave disturbance passes by to the north. Some
guidance hints the potential for fog to develop around the North Bay
Valleys and perhaps near San Francisco and perhaps into the East
Bay overnight.

&&

.LONG TERM...
(Saturday through Thursday)
Issued at 317 AM PST Fri Feb 21 2025

Upper level zonal flow through the weekend and into early next week
due to additional shortwaves moving across the PacNW. This may bring
a few light showers to far northern Sonoma and Napa counties Sunday
into Monday, though if that were to happen rainfall amount generally
appear to be negligible to perhaps a few couple hundredths of an
inch. Otherwise, dry and warmer weather persists. Upper level
ridging builds by midweek. Agree with the previous shift in that
high temperatures will be worth watching out for given the
proximity to the records. For now, kept the NBM forecast in, but
should the trends continue to lean warmer we may need to bump the
forecast up a few degrees.

By late week or next weekend, guidance from ensemble and
deterministic models shows a cut off low developing and tracking
over CA. It`s too early to say where but it could bring a few
showers to the region.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 338 AM PST Fri Feb 21 2025

VFR through the TAF period for most terminals with the
introduction of some isolated IFR cigs by the end of the current
period (Saturday morning). Low clouds increase late Friday into
Saturday morning with the passage of a weak upper level trough.
Winds remain light and onshore, conducive for some morning marine
stratus to work its way into the valleys. However, confidence is
low in determining SCT vs BKN skies at the moment.

Vicinity of SFO...VFR through the TAF period with typical breezy
onshore winds during the afternoon. Low clouds increase at the end
of the period, but expected to remain VFR as of this issuance.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...VFR through the TAF period with light
onshore winds.

.MARINE...
(Today through Wednesday)
Issued at 853 AM PST Fri Feb 21 2025

Seas and winds continue to ease through the weekend with fair
conditions lasting into the early part of next week. A new,
moderate northwesterly swell enters the waters by Tuesday next
week.
