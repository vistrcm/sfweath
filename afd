.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 126 AM PST Thu Feb 15 2024

High pressure is building following the recent passage of a cold
front. A few lingering showers will taper off this morning, and
dry weather weather will prevail through Friday night. A series of
systems will bring more impactful rain, strong wind, and high
surf this weekend.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 126 AM PST Thu Feb 15 2024

The main band of showers is pushing through southern Monterey
County this morning, with a few isolated showers remaining across
the Bay Area. These are quickly dissipating, and there will
actually be plenty of sunshine through the day. High pressure
building in the wake of the front will support light winds.
Temperatures will remain mild with a warmer than average morning
and near average afternoon. Overall, Thursday will be a great day
to get outside and enjoy the weather.

.LONG TERM...
(Friday through Wednesday)
Issued at 126 AM PST Thu Feb 15 2024

High clouds will begin to increase Friday and southerly winds will
gradually increase through the day. Otherwise, the weather will
still be fairly benign through the day. The next cold front will
bring rain beginning late Friday night for the North Bay,
Saturday morning for the Bay Area, and mid-day Saturday for the
Central Coast. The total accumulation from this system is expected
to be 1-2" in the North Bay and 0.5-1" through the rest of the Bay
Area and Central Coast lowlands. Rain will not be the only impact
from this system. Strong southerly winds will precede the frontal
passage. High surf will begin to impact the beaches on Saturday
from a combination of strong winds and incoming westerly swell.
Rain will begin to taper off Sunday morning, but the break will be
short-lived.

By Sunday evening, a mature, gale force low pressure system will
be located roughly 500 miles west of northern California. This
system will have a warm, cold, and occluded front associated with
it, which could all impact the Bay Area at different times.
There`s even a slight chance for thunderstorms late Sunday night
or Monday morning, especially if and where the triple point
(confluence of all three fronts) comes ashore.

The main surface low pressure system is expected to be well north
of the low-latitude jet stream, causing a lack of steering flow.
When this happens, the forward motion of the storm will slow
considerably, meaning we will be dealing with this system for
several days. Also, when the motion is slow, the predictability of
the storm track goes out the window. Slow, staggering storms are
notoriously hard to forecast. The best we can say for now is that
there is a good chance for on-and-off rain from Sunday evening
through the middle of next week. The total accumulation from this
second system is expected to be in the 2-4" range, with less in
the rainshadowed vallies and more in the coastal mountains. Again,
stay tuned as this forecast is subject to change moreso than
usual.

Flooding concerns remain, with most rivers expected to crest on
Monday or Tuesday. The current ensemble guidance from the CNRFC
indicates the San Lorenzo River at Big Trees has a 33% chance of
reaching flood stage. The Russian River at Guerneville has a 37%
chance of reaching flood stage. The Salinas River at Spreckels and
Pajaro River at Chittenden will be slower to crest, and
respectively have a 23% and 28% chance of reaching flood stage
later in the week. These probabilities have all increased by 5-10%
in recent updates. In addition to these flooding concerns, strong
winds and saturated soils could lead to more downed trees and
potential power outages. The USGS is closely monitoring the soil
moisture and has indicated that landslides are also possible if
the rain rates are high enough this weekend.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 336 AM PST Thu Feb 15 2024

The radar is showing just a few light showers lingering across
the Bay Area this morning. Otherwise, the post front environment
is mostly clear with some stratocumulus developing. These clouds
may form or drift over the terminals, creating brief periods of
MVFR ceilings. Otherwise the TAF period will be dominated by VFR
conditions with some high clouds and light winds.

Vicinity of SFO...SFO and OAK may fluctuate between VFR and MVFR
ceilings this morning due to patchy low clouds over land. The
trend should be for these clouds to mix out through the morning
with VFR conditions and a gentle NW breeze in the afternoon.

SFO Bridge Approach...The approach over the Bay will likely stay
more cloud free than the terminals this morning. Otherwise
conditions will be similar.

Monterey Bay Terminals...Currently VFR and expected to remain so
through the TAF period. There is a slight chance for low stratus
and fog in the Salinas Valley early Friday morning.

.MARINE...
(Today through Tuesday)
Issued at 336 AM PST Thu Feb 15 2024

Shower activity will continue to diminish across the waters
through the morning. Gentle to moderate breezes expected today
before southerly winds begin to increase Friday ahead of the next
weather system. Southerly winds will become strong Saturday with
gale force gusts possible. Rain returns to the coastal waters
Friday evening lasting through early next week. A short break in
the rain is expected Sunday morning. In addition, a building
westerly swell this weekend of will result in elevated and
hazardous seas.
