...New AVIATION...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 853 PM PDT Sun Jul 2 2023

A cooling trend is forecast early this week so that the region
returns to near seasonable temperatures by the July 4th holiday.
Expect normal temperatures through the rest of the week.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 412 AM PDT Mon Jul 3 2023

The center of the 500 mb high pressure system continues to get
nudged eastward to the CA/NV/AZ border, with somewhat decreasing 500
mb heights, less compressional warming over our cwa mixing in with a
solidly defined marine layer that`s steadily regaining greater
depth. Bodega Bay, Fort Ord and Point Sur profiler data show the
marine layer depth varying between 1300 feet and 1600 feet. 24 hour
temperature trends are mostly cooler (negative) even at elevation
across the cwa, however it`s relative of course since it was warm to
very warm, hot at elevation with the strong lower level temperature
inversion over the weekend. A cooling trend is underway and the pace
of cooling will quicken going into tonight. The surface pressure
gradients SFO-SAC 2.9 mb and SMX-SFO 1.5 mb, including the ACV-SFO
0.3 mb (essentially flat which is good for allowing the marine
layer to gain more depth, since there`s no large scale northerly
wind, downsloping, warming & drying). Warm to hot daytime temperatures
today far inland will be due to residual warmth under the recently
strong high pressure system coupled to diurnal warming.

.LONG TERM...
(Tuesday through Sunday)
Issued at 412 AM PDT Mon Jul 3 2023

With each passing day inland hot daytime temperatures will gradually
ease with an increasing reach of onshore breezes. Heat risks inland
will also subside with each passing day. Conditions are favorable
this week for an ongoing, steady marine layer with steadily increasing
depth. At 925 mb (~ 2500 ft) and 850 mb (~ 5000 ft) temperatures
cool gradually this week, 850 mb temps nearing 19C to 20C which is
near early July normal per long term Oakland upper air climatology.
A slow rate of cooling in the lower levels allows a greater depth to
the marine layer while not too abrupt to disrupt or fully weaken and
mix out the marine layer temperature inversion. Good structure
includes steady northwest winds around the eastern Pacific surface
high, bringing a good balance of water vapor (per dewpoint temps
forecast) and near surface to surface cool air advection; also
supported by lowering theta-e forecasts i.e. mid-latitude influence
through this week. 1000 mb (~800 ft) temperature advection shows air
temps near 9C to 10C along the coast per the NAM beginning Tuesday
morning; it`ll feel chilly again on the coast with lows near or
slightly below early July normal. On this note, meso-scale and
occasionally the GFS and ECMWF also show recurring night and morning
patchy light measurable drizzle on the coast. Challenging to
forecast, for now will just add patchy light drizzle to the grids
for tonight and Tuesday morning, especially since the NAM shows more
robust near surface cooling.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 453 AM PDT Mon Jul 3 2023

Satellite and models currently showing the onshore winds pushing
some of the stratus off the coast inland over the terminals causing
a mix of VFR, IFR,and LIFR conditions. The marine layer is not quite
deep yet, but is in the process of rebuilding as the profiler
currently shows the marine layer is ~1000 feet near Bodega Bay. As
diurnal heating takes into effect, expect to see clearing around 17-
18Z. Stratus is expected to return late tonight but moderate
confidence on ceiling height. Possible LIFR conditions mostly in the
North Bay and Monterey SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO. Bay and
MVFR conditions near SF Bay near midnight tonight. Inland terminals
should remain VFR through the TAF period. Wind speed are picking up
sooner than expected where most of the terminals are already
moderate to breezy with speeds up to 12 knots. Direction of winds
varies as the North Bay shows a more South/Southwesterly component
as the rest of the terminals show a North/Northwesterly component.
Expect winds to continue increasing with a peak near the afternoon
then transitioning back to light to moderate winds tonight.

Vicinity of SFO...VFR currently at KSFO, but satellite shows stratus
sitting on the cusp of the the San Bruno gap. Low confidence at the
moment that stratus will spill over but some models suggest MVFR
ceilings for the next few hours. Any stratus formed, will clear by
16-17Z. Otherwise, expect VFR for most of today with moderate
confidence that stratus will return tonight bringing MVFR ceilings.
Some models even suggest ceilings dropping as low as IFR heights,
but had low confidence to include at this moment. Winds show a N/NW
component with speeds up to 10 knots. Expect those winds to increase
throughout the morning into the afternoon then decreasing as we
approach the night.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...IFR. Expect conditions to improve to VFR
near 17-18Z. Stratus is expected to return tonight bringing IFR/LIFR
conditions but timing and ceiling height was a bit uncertain. Winds
are starting to increase to moderate and is expected to peak in the
afternoon with KSNS experiencing stronger winds due to the Salinas
Valley.

.MARINE...
(Today through Saturday)
Issued at 234 AM PDT Mon Jul 3 2023

Generally light west to northwest winds, aside from the far
northern outer waters where winds will be moderate and gusty at
times. Gusty afternoon and evening onshore winds developing today
and on the 4th of July north of the Bay Bridge to the Delta. Mixed
seas continuing through the week, with a longer period southerly
swell around 16-18 seconds and a shorter period northwesterly
swell.

&&

.FIRE WEATHER...
(Today through Tuesday)
Issued at 1140 PM PDT Sun Jul 2 2023

Cooler air and humidity recoveries with onshore breezes along the
coast and across the bays in a 1,000 feet marine layer, otherwise
hot and dry daytime conditions continuing far inland with increased
fire danger and ignition probabilities as daytime temperatures reach
the 90s. Hot afternoon temperatures far inland will be followed by
mild to warm nights in the higher terrain. Despite the coastal and
bays cool down early to mid week, expect modest humidity recoveries
to lag behind in the far interior and in the higher terrain. Any
nighttime ignitions in the hills will not get typical humidity
recover to help with suppression.

.MTR WATCHES/WARNINGS/ADVISORIES...
CA...Coastal Flood Advisory until 3 AM PDT Wednesday for CAZ506.

PZ...Small Craft Advisory from 3 PM this afternoon to 9 PM PDT this
     evening for PZZ530.

     Small Craft Advisory from 3 PM to 9 PM PDT Tuesday for PZZ530.
