.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 304 AM PDT Tue May 16 2023

Expect warm, above normal daytime highs for inland areas today and
tomorrow. Meanwhile, coastal areas will have highs near or
slightly below normal due to morning coastal stratus. Possibility
of patchy fog and drizzle closer to the coast. Otherwise, the rain
outlook in the 7 day forecast is not promising.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 304 AM PDT Tue May 16 2023

Nighttime satellite imagery is showing a solid inland push of
coastal stratus encompassing much of Sonoma County, the western
areas of the East Bay from Martinez southward to Lafayette...San
Ramon...and Fremont, the Santa Clara Valley, and Salinas Valley.
This push is a bit more expansive than what we saw early yesterday
morning and it`s causing current temperatures to be running a few
degrees cooler than 24 hours ago. The marine layer has shown some
compression from 2000 ft deep yesterday to around 1200 ft at this
hour. Have added the mention of drizzle along the coast as we`ve
been experiencing light drizzle here at the office. Much of this
stratus is low clouds, however, there could be isolated patches
of fog with lowered visibilities. For example, Santa Rosa has
oscillated between 3/4 mile visibility up to 3 miles in the past
hour. When visibility gets to 1/4 mile or below is when we
consider it to be fog. If you have to drive during the early
morning hours, be aware that you might encounter areas of lowered
visibility.

Similar to yesterday, we expect the stratus to retreat to the
coast as the day progresses. That afternoon sunshine will allow
for a good warm up in the inland areas. Synoptically, ridging over
our region today (which is helping compress the marine layer) will
bring a warmer airmass aloft to help raise our afternoon temps.
Highs today will be in the 80s to low 90s across the interior
while coastal areas stay in the upper 50s to low 70s. There is
moderate HeatRisk for interior areas this afternoon which means
those sensitive to heat should stay cool and well hydrated during
the hottest part of the day. Look for a return of stratus tonight,
but the ridge will keep the marine layer compressed which should
lessen the extent of inland intrusion overnight into Wednesday
morning.

.LONG TERM...
(Wednesday through Monday)
Issued at 304 AM PDT Tue May 16 2023

The long term forecast will primarily be slight cooling in
daytime highs with continued dry weather. Although ridging
persists over NorCal this week, a low pressure developing over
SoCal on Wednesday coupled with the low pressure system continuing
to sit over the Eastern Pacific will weaken that ridge slightly.
This will enable a subtle cooling trend for our daytime highs
Wednesday into the weekend. By Sunday into Monday, that trough
over the Eastern Pacific will move into the Pacific NW and into
far NorCal, but precipitation associated with it will stay north
of our CWA.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 427 AM PDT Tue May 16 2023

Solid stratus coverage this morning below about 1000 feet will
remain largely locked in place through sunrise. IFR cigs for most
through about the 17Z hour with patchy FG in the North Bay. Breezy
onshore flow this afternoon. Low confidence in stratus return this
evening. Expect sporadic IFR cigs this late tonight once again,
but coverage is expected to be less than this morning.

Vicinity of KSFO...IFR cigs this morning through sunrise with a
clearing to VFR expected by about the 18Z hour. Have been seeing
some variation in cig heights this morning to between IFR-LIFR, so
included periodic LIFR cigs at the terminal around sunrise. Breezy
onshore flow 10-15 kts this afternoon. As previously stated, low
confidence in stratus return this evening, though have included
IFR cigs toward the end of the TAF period to account for
persistence forecast given solid marine layer and high pressure
aloft.

KSFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...LIFR cigs this morning, gradually lifting
through sunrise. Clearing to VFR expected by about 18Z. Have
observed some light, sporadic DZ this morning around Monterey Bay.
Would expect that to continue through these early morning hours.
Overall pleasant this afternoon with light to breezy onshore flow.
Returning to IFR cigs overnight tonight with higher confidence
here compared to elsewhere around the region.

.MARINE...
(Today through Sunday)
Issued at 304 AM PDT Tue May 16 2023

A nearly stationary and weak surface high pressure system will
remain located over the offshore waters while a surface thermal
low pressure trough remains stationary over interior California.
Northwesterly winds will continue across the coastal waters while
westerly winds prevail across the bays, strongest each afternoon
and evening. Moderate period mixed seas prevails through the week.
