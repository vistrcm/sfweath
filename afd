...New UPDATE...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 239 AM PDT Sun Oct 13 2024

A warming trend is expected today through Tuesday before another
system brings more widespread rain potential this upcoming
Wednesday. Warmer and drier conditions expected by late week.

&&

.UPDATE...
Issued at 453 AM PDT Sun Oct 13 2024

Light rain and/or drizzle continues early this morning across the
North Bay and down into the San Francisco Peninsula. Rainfall
amounts generally remain below 0.05". This is likely a result of the
dissipating frontal boundary across the region. Precipitation is
likely to begin to diminish by late morning.

&&

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 239 AM PDT Sun Oct 13 2024

Warmer temperatures are expected today, especially across the North
Bay where rain showers were present yesterday and temperatures were
as much as 13 degrees below seasonal averages. Temperatures this
afternoon will largely be near seasonal averages as low clouds
dissipate across inland areas and retreat to the coast. However,
some coastal locations may not see the sun at all today due to low
cloud cover. Generally expecting upper 70`s to low 80`s across the
interior, low-to-mid 70`s for San Francisco and the Bay Shoreline,
and upper 60`s to low 70`s near the coast.

Tonight, expecting temperatures to drop into the low-to-upper 50`s
for most. As moist conditions prevail across the region, cannot
rule out coastal and favored upslope spots to experience drizzle.

&&

.LONG TERM...
(Monday through Saturday)
Issued at 239 AM PDT Sun Oct 13 2024

Temperatures are likely to remain near normal for this time of year
through Tuesday. Outside of overnight and early morning coastal
drizzle, the region will remain dry throughout Tuesday. Beginning
early Wednesday, another upper level trough will approach the coast
and bring with it the potential for light rain/rain showers.
Rainfall amounts have trended downward from previous days. Now, it
is looking like the best chance for measurable rainfall to be focused
on the North Bay with little to nothing south of the Golden Gate.

By late week, high temperatures start to warm again into the upper
70`s to low 80`s across the interior as an upper level ridge
develops and builds inland. As the upper level trough pushes inland,
it is increasingly likely the region will experience a period of
offshore flow Thursday night through at least Saturday, especially
across the North Bay and East Bay mountains/hills. This will be the
result of an "inside slider" pattern setting up across the region
which would produce elevated fire weather conditions. However, the
operational run of the European model does not show this and is more
progressive with the pattern aloft, not developing into a cut off
low over the Desert Southwest. Be sure to stay up-to-date with the
latest forecast information as there remains some uncertainties in
the extended!

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 427 AM PDT Sun Oct 13 2024

A mix of VFR, MVFR and IFR conditions. Some terminals are
experiencing some alternation between VFR and MVFR/IFR as the
stratus continues to dissolve and rebuild through the night. VFR is
expected to return for all terminals, except KMRY between 18-19Z.
Some models show even later clearing near 20Z for some terminals but
had lower confidence to include in TAFs at this moment. A mix of
MVFR/IFR/LIFR should return for coastal terminals late Sunday night,
after 04-06Z.

Vicinity of SFO...MVFR  but there is a chance for a few moments of
IFR through the morning, but had low confidence to include in TAFs.
Clearing to VFR is expected near 19Z but there is a chance that
clearing may occur near 20Z. Ceilings may lower to IFR overnight but
confidence is low to moderate, with higher confidence that MVFR
ceilings will return near 05Z. If IFR occurs, expect near 09Z, early
Monday morning. Onshore breezy conditions return by Sunday
afternoon then return to moderate overnight.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...IFR currently, but ceilings are
consistently lifting and lowering between VFR/MVFR/LIFR through the
night. Clearing is expected near 19Z over KSNS while models show
that there is a moderate chance that KMRY may not clear and will
remain MVFR/IFR/LIFR through the TAF period.

&&

.MARINE...
(Today through Friday)
Issued at 239 AM PDT Sun Oct 13 2024

Seas will continue to abate through Sunday before building to
become rough again by Monday afternoon. Gusty winds south of Point
Sur will bring some hazardous conditions Monday afternoon. Long,
moderate swell with a period of 13-17 seconds is forecast through
Tuesday. A strong storm system will bring near gale force gusts by
Wednesday.

&&

.BEACHES...
Issued at 1133 AM PDT Sat Oct 12 2024

Long period northwesterly swell of around 12 to 15 seconds with
wave heights approaching 10 feet will briefly translate to a
moderate risk of sneaker waves. This will mainly, though not
limited to, be for areas across coastal Sonoma and Marin counties
late Monday afternoon/early evening. Those planning on heading to
beaches should be cognizant of the potential dangers. Check with
local officials and lifeguard personnel before recreating in the
water.

.MTR WATCHES/WARNINGS/ADVISORIES...
CA...None.
PZ...Small Craft Advisory from 3 PM Monday to 9 AM PDT Tuesday for Pt
     Arena to Pt Reyes 10-60 NM-Pt Pinos to Pt Piedras Blancas 0-
     10 nm.
