.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 226 AM PST Tue Jan 7 2025

The stage is set for gusty offshore conditions across the Bay
Area. Quiet and dry weather across our region from Wednesday into
the weekend. Another potential gusty offshore period early next
week.

&&

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and Wednesday)
Issued at 226 AM PST Tue Jan 7 2025

Gusty winds are ongoing this morning across the high terrain of
the interior North Bay and East Bay. Some notable gusts as of
writing; 67 mph at Mt. St. Helena, 46 mph at Mt. Umunhum, and 44
mph at Mt. Diablo. Offshore-oriented gradients approaching the
99th percentile through this morning should promote a rapid
increase in winds over the next several hours. A Wind Advisory
remains in effect until Wednesday morning for the interior North
Bay, all of the East Bay and SF Peninsula, and the Santa Cruz Mtns
and Eastern Santa Clara hills. Decent stability around mountain
top level during the morning hours will support a relative peak
this morning, and again Wednesday morning around some of the
higher terrain areas. In terms of magnitude; still on track with
previous forecasts. Some more favorable locations like Mt. St.
Helena will undoubtedly continue to be an outlier on the high
end, as usual. Elsewhere, gusts in the 45-55 mph range can still
be expected in the higher terrain, and 25-35 mph in the valleys
and across lower terrain.

.LONG TERM...
(Thursday through Monday)
Issued at 226 AM PST Tue Jan 7 2025

Thursday into the weekend looks wicked nice with comfortable, mild
temps and mostly clear skies during the afternoons. By the end of
the extended period early next week, there is the potential of
either chilly temperatures or another gusty offshore wind event.
Cluster analysis strongly supports an amplified meridional flow
pattern similar to what is currently unfolding, with some
uncertainty with trough placement over the SW US, which will
ultimately decide the strength or occurrence of offshore winds
for our area.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 342 AM PST Tue Jan 7 2025

Stratus and fog have cleared the region this morning as offshore
winds aloft have increased. LLWS will remain possible over the Bay
Area terminals this morning but will diminish as surface winds
increase. Strong offshore winds are expected Tuesday morning and
afternoon, with gusts up to 25 to 30 knots. As winds ease this
evening and overnight, look for LLWS again over the Bay Area
terminals with less of a concern for the Monterey Bay terminals.
Generally, VFR conditions are expected to persist through the TAF
period.

Vicinity of SFO...VFR. Offshore winds will increase later this
morning, continue through the afternoon and begin to ease later this
evening. Winds will gust up to 25 to 30 knots this afternoon.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...VFR. Offshore winds are expected by late
morning and early afternoon with gusts up to around 20 knots. Winds
ease late this evening and into the overnight hours to less than 12
knots.

.MARINE...
(Today through Sunday)
Issued at 226 AM PST Tue Jan 7 2025

Northwesterly swell of 8 to 11 feet have moved into our waters and
will likely hold through much of Tuesday. Seas will abate some,
close to 6 to 8 feet, for mid to late week before building again
over the weekend. In addition to seas, gusty north winds resulting
in hazardous conditions for small craft continues through early
Wednesday morning.

.BEACHES...
Issued at 342 AM PST Tue Jan 7 2025

The Beach Hazard Statement remains in effect until 9 PM Tuesday.
Buoys are reporting swell periods of 18-20 seconds with heights of
7-10 feet. This translates to breaking waves up to 20 feet
mathematically, but the bigger threat is from sneaker waves and
rip currents. Long period, moderate height swell has the potential
to generate sneaker waves with tremendous beach run-up. These act
similar to a tsunami surge. Sneaker wave physics is complex, and
not fully understood, but the main ingredient is long period
swell. The threat is enhanced with a rising tide. Fortunately, we
are in a 1st quarter moon phase, with a less impactful neap tide.
We can`t guarantee that sneaker waves will be observed, but the
chances are much higher than normal, and strong currents are
expected. Maintain a larger than normal buffer from the water`s
edge, and never turn your back on the ocean!
