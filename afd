...New UPDATE, MARINE...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 240 AM PST Wed Feb 21 2024

Showers gradually tapering off today. Dry conditions are expected
for the remainder of this week with unsettled conditions returning
by Saturday night. This weekend`s rain appears to be beneficial
and not overly impactful.

&&

.UPDATE...
Issued at 845 AM PST Wed Feb 21 2024

Areas of dense fog continue across the North Bay and East Bay
valleys this morning with a Dense Fog Advisory in effect until 10 AM
PST. Isolated showers persist over the North Bay and off of the San
Fransico Peninsula this morning but should taper off by this
afternoon. However, cannot rule out isolated convection with daytime
heating, but conditions will dry out after sunset. Overall, the
forecast remains on track for today with no updates anticipated.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 323 AM PST Wed Feb 21 2024

A quasi-stationary long wave trough is over the California
offshore waters, through late week to early next week the long
wave trough will retrogress back near 130W longitude i.e. approx
400 miles west of the Bay Area. Over our forecast area 700 mb to
500 mb thermal and height troughing resulting in widely scattered
to scattered showers continues early this morning. Not all
locations are still getting wet weather, satellite also shows
partial clearing; overall cooling per 24 hour trends due to large
scale troughing, rain cooled air and nocturnal radiative cooling
is resulting in a few patches of fog, including dense fog with
surface visibility less than 1/4 mile. Essentially one more 500 mb
short wave vorticity trough to our west over the CA coastal
waters exits the aforementioned long wave trough, the short wave
moving to our east by late morning. Post 500 mb vorticity trough,
temps at the 500 mb level will then gradually warm reducing layer
instability from the ground up to approx 700 mb. For the most part
expect residual mainly very low topped widely scattered to
scattered showers through morning, by late morning, showers may
still tap surface based solar heating while the aforementioned
transition takes place today, showers are otherwise expected to
fully diminish by sunset today with the loss of surface warming.

Tonight 500 mb thermal and height ridging develop, large scale
sinking resulting in increasing stability via development of a
subsidence temperature inversion. Widespread dry weather tonight,
however nocturnal cooling will result in patchy fog overnight and
Thursday morning.

.LONG TERM...
(Thursday through Tuesday)
Issued at 323 AM PST Wed Feb 21 2024

It was mentioned in the short term discussion that a long wave
trough will retrogress back near 130W longitude, this long wave
trough will be the focus for another storm developing far out at
sea late this week and weekend. This storm will not be close enough
to bring either wet or windy weather to our forecast area in the
near to early medium term; recent GEFS and EPS qpf mean forecasts
have trended drier for the weekend. The storm will however still
have a chance to entrain subtropical moisture while stationary
far out at sea and it should be closely watched for overall
residence time while potentially drawing in additional subtropical
water vapor. Beginning near the 120 hour (5 days out) forecast
the low is forecast to begin merging with a newly arriving
mid/high latitude open wave 500 mb trough forecast to reach the
Pacific Northwest Sunday-Monday then the Intermountain West
Tuesday. Current model forecasts are indicating a period of light
rain developing in our forecast area, though not until Sunday-
Monday, this is due to eventual merging of aforementioned low
pressure systems. The strength of the mid/high latitude open wave
500 mb trough caught up in the polar jet stream and the overall
mid-latitude influences may help limit precipitation with this
system here in our forecast area, though still warrants close
monitoring.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 324 AM PST Wed Feb 21 2024

Currently seeing just a few scattered rain showers across the
region, rain chances will continue to diminish through the morning.
Widespread VFR will prevail by this afternoon with only STS and
potentially MRY and SNS looking to return to MVFR before the end of
the TAF period.

Vicinity of SFO...Currently VFR with light southwesterly flow. VFR
through the TAF period; however, there will likely be a scattered
deck of low clouds over the terminal into the late morning hours.
Winds will be southwesterly throughout the day before becoming
southeasterly in the early morning hours of Thursday.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...Currently MVFR at MRY and VFR at SNS with
both terminals experiencing breezy drainage flow. Winds become
onshore by mid-morning before returning to drainage flow overnight.

&&

.MARINE...
(Today through Monday)
Issued at 845 AM PST Wed Feb 21 2024

Showers reduce into the afternoon with calm weather expected
through the weekend. A moderate northwest swell arrives today and
lasts into the next work week.

&&

.MTR WATCHES/WARNINGS/ADVISORIES...
CA...Dense Fog Advisory until 10 AM PST this morning for CAZ506-510.

PZ...None.
