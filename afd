...New AVIATION, MARINE...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 317 AM PDT Sat Aug 3 2024

Fairly quiet after monsoonal moisture moves out today. Warm
temperatures continue into next week. Cooler temperatures on tap
for late next week.

&&

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 317 AM PDT Sat Aug 3 2024

Lingering mid and high clouds associated with monsoonal moisture
this morning. No other shower activity is expected, but some
locations can`t rule out another couple of sprinkles through the
morning, especially in the North Bay and the Central Coast. By
this afternoon, most locations should be under clear or mostly
clear skies. We are expecting skies to clear early enough to see
temperatures higher than they were yesterday, expect for the North
Bay where the high clouds may linger into the afternoon. High
temps today in the North Bay will be very similar to yesterday.
Elsewhere, expect a 2-4 degree increase from yesterday across
inland areas.

.LONG TERM...
(Sunday through Friday)
Issued at 317 AM PDT Sat Aug 3 2024

Nothing terribly exciting to write about in the long term. The
ridge builds in a bit more during the early part of the week as
the embedded trough carrying the monsoonal moisture completely
moves out of the picture. Temperatures increase further and peak
Tuesday with high temps about 8-14 degrees above normal depending
on how far inland you are. Guidance is pretty reliably advertising
a shift in the ridge to the east, which would allow troughing
along the West Coast and bring in cooler temperatures. Chances are
we will be looking at temperatures right around normal by Thursday
into next weekend.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 441 AM PDT Sat Aug 3 2024

The coastal stratus has not developed to the extent earlier expected
tonight. Sounding data from the 00Z balloon and subsequent aircraft
soundings indicate that the hint of an elevated mixed layer remains
over the region, and confidence in stratus development for the rest
of this morning has decreased. Convective showers have mostly passed
us by, and by the afternoon, breezy onshore flow should prevail.
Model output is suggesting a return to a more typical pattern of
widespread stratus this evening into Sunday morning.

Vicinity of SFO... Confidence in IFR stratus tonight has decreased
as it has not developed so far tonight. Breezy west-northwest flow
resumes in the afternoon and evening. Stratus us set to return to
the terminal this evening into Sunday morning, but confidence in
timing is low. Best chances for the stratus will come early Sunday
morning.

SFO Bridge Approach... Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals... Confidence in the stratus forecast tonight
has decreased as MRY has cleared out and is again under an IFR
ceiling. Whatever stratus is able to develop will mix out later this
morning with breezy onshore winds in the afternoon, before returning
to the terminals in the evening hours.

.MARINE...
(Today through Thursday)
Issued at 441 AM PDT Sat Aug 3 2024

Moderate to fresh northwesterly breezes with fresh to strong
gusts will continue through the forecast period. Moderate seas
will build to rough in the outer waters by Tuesday. While not
forecast to be of direct impact to our area, Tropical Storm
Carlotta, along with two other disturbances, continue to churn in
the Eastern Pacific. We will continue to monitor the tropics to
see if any significant southerly swell is on the way.

CA...None.
PZ...Small Craft Advisory until 9 AM PDT Sunday for Pigeon Pt to Pt
     Pinos 10-60 NM-Pt Arena to Pt Reyes 10-60 NM.
