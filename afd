...New AVIATION...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 235 AM PST Thu Jan 18 2024

Patchy morning dense fog in the valleys, otherwise dry and
partially cloudy today. Next rain systems come through Friday and
Sunday with periods of moderate to heavy rain.

&&

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 257 AM PST Thu Jan 18 2024

Early morning patchy valley fog including patchy dense fog in the
North Bay valleys and the Salinas Valley is developing and
satellite also shows mid and high clouds increasing across the Bay
Area. Increasing clouds decreasing the rate of nocturnal radiative
cooling over the Bay Area may help limit dense fog there, with a
mainly clear sky allowing better chances of dense fog over the
Salinas Valley (also seeing dense fog developing over in NWS
Hanford`s forecast area). Then there`s cold air drainage winds to
consider in the Salinas Valley that may work to extend dense fog
coverage or dissipate fog depending how much surface winds mix the
air. Will soon issue a dense fog advisory until 11 am today since
increasing cloud cover may then slow mixing rates also, the dense
fog advisory including both the North Bay valleys and the Salinas
Valley. Otherwise nearly all locations including most mountain
valleys are cooler compared to 24 hours ago. The highest elevation
peaks are slightly warmer compared to 24 hours ago due to a lower
level temperature inversion.

Dry weather due to a high pressure system continues over the
forecast area today. Daytime highs will be similar to Wednesday,
upper 50s to lower 60s except a few mid 60s in the central and
southern valleys. Cloudy tonight, lows in the 40s.

.LONG TERM...
(Friday through Wednesday)
Issued at 257 AM PST Thu Jan 18 2024

An open wave 500 mb trough of low pressure approx 1600 miles to
our west this morning will move eastward becoming a closed 500 mb
low pressure system with surface low development several hundred
miles to our west late tonight and Friday morning. Friday will
start with dry weather most locations with exception of the North
Bay where some light rain or sprinkles may begin. The low will
then sweep in a band of rain across our forecast area during the
day and Friday night. Southerly winds will become breezy to gusty
with the rain band, however current indications are winds will stay
below wind advisory criteria. All locations will receive measurable
rainfall Friday and Friday night, highest amounts over the hills
and mountains, lesser amounts over the valleys where some rain
shadowing will occur. Healthy dynamics and water vapor will couple
in this initial frontal system and good news is from strictly an
integrated water vapor transport (IVT) perspective, global models
GFS and ECMWF agree IVT values with this rain band will be mainly
weak.

Then on the immediate heels of Friday`s initial frontal system,
an opening of the door to a rain soaking weekend ahead, the meso-
scale models are picking up on troughing extending rainfall over
the Bay Area Saturday and Saturday evening before rain temporarily
diminishes Saturday night and Sunday morning. Post frontal winds
will have by Saturday shifted to a southwesterly direction which
is more favorable for upsloping winds and cooling, the cooling
resulting in more rain falling from clouds (orographic enhanced
rain); per GFS low end IVT values linger during the day.

A strong jet stream across the Pacific will then push another low
pressure trough with moderate to heavy rain and gusty southwest
winds across our forecast area Sunday, Sunday night and early
Monday. Relatively elevated IVT returns again late in the weekend
coupled to this frontal system moving through. As mentioned in
the hydrology section below, in addition to rapid rises on rivers,
streams and creeks, expect nuisance and minor flooding across the
region including an increasing risk for shallow landslides as soils
across the Bay Area reach saturation.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 403 AM PST Thu Jan 18 2024

Dense fog continues to shroud the North Bay terminals at this hour,
leading to LIFR conditions. Into the late morning, fog is expected
to begin to dissipate, with VFR conditions returning towards the
late morning. Elsewhere, expect VFR conditions to persist through
the day today with high clouds beginning to fill in ahead of the
next front and associated rain. Winds generally light and below 10
knots into the evening today, becoming more variable into the night.
Rain begins just beyond the current TAF period.


Vicinity of SFO...Low clouds over the bay have advected over the
terminal, leading to IFR CIGs. High clouds currently obscure
satellite view of low clouds, though highest confidence is in low
clouds dissipating closer to sunrise, therefore returning conditions
to VFR. VFR remains through the end of the TAF period with light
southerly winds this afternoon. Winds ease and become variable into
the night.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...VFR through the TAF period, with generally
light winds and high clouds that will build in throughout the day.
KSNS is likely to see moderate SE drainage winds return this
morning, but easing to become light into the afternoon. Drainage
winds look to make a return early Friday morning for KSNS.

.MARINE...
(Tonight through next Monday)
Issued at 239 AM PST Thu Jan 18 2024

Gentle to moderate southerly winds continue through the day today,
but increase come Friday late morning to be fresh to strong as the
next front approaches. These winds will create dangerous
conditions for small craft. Rain chances begin over the waters
mid morning of Friday and last through the weekend as multiple
rain systems move through the region. Come Saturday, winds
decrease to become moderate out of the south, and persist through
the start of the next workweek. Thunderstorms are possible over
the waters Sunday into Monday, where wind gusts and seas could be
locally higher near storms.

.HYDROLOGY...
Issued at 1255 PM PST Wed Jan 17 2024

Due to the potential for significant rainfall over the weekend, the
WPC has issued a slight risk (5-15% probability) of excessive
rainfall across the North Bay for Sunday, meaning that there is a
chance that rain totals could exceed flash flood guidance issued by
the River Forecast Center in Sacramento. A Hydrologic Outlook (WMO
header FGUS76) has been issued to highlight the potential for rapid
rises along rivers, streams, and creeks. The main hydrologic issues
will be nuisance and minor flooding across the region, and an
increased risk for shallow landslides as soils across the Bay Area
reach saturation. Stay tuned to the lastest forecast for the most
accurate weather information.
