.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 120 AM PST Tue Feb 20 2024

Scattered showers and isolated thunderstorms will increase in
coverage this afternoon and evening. Localized flooding remains a
concern for areas that experience heavy rainfall. Drier conditions
return for mid to late week, with rain returning for the weekend.
This weekend`s rain appears to be beneficial and not overly
impactful.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 120 AM PST Tue Feb 20 2024

Upper troughing encompassed much of the northeast Pacific earth this
morning with a closed upper circulation just offshore from the N
CA/OR coast. A 160 kt basal jet was located along the equatorward
side of the upper trough and was pointed into SoCal as of this
writing. An occluding surface low was noted off the NW CA coast,
with low-level troughing extending SSW from it. Showers and
thunderstorms were ongoing ahead of the trough around 250 nm
offshore from the Central Coast, with additional showers ongoing
across the Bay Area. For today expect the upper trough to slowly
progress through the region. As temperatures aloft drop this will
steepen lapse rates and increase instability with forcing for ascent
enhanced via the approaching surface trough. Expect an uptick in
shower coverage later this morning with shower and storm potential
peaking this afternoon and evening. Several southwest to northeast
bands of (mainly) light showers were noted early this morning, and
some of the convection allowing models suggest similar
banding/training of showers is possible later today. HREF ensemble
mean probabilities for seeing 1"+ in a 3 hour period peak at 10% as
early as 18Z/10AM for the North Bay this morning and spread through
the remainder of the Bay Area between 21Z/1PM and 00Z/4 PM before
reaching the Central Coast between 03Z/7PM and 06Z/10 PM. Given this
setup we`ll need to keep an eye on flooding potential yet again
today. For most areas this means primarily minor urban and small
stream flooding. However flash flooding is a possibility if any
heavier rain bands are able to train over an urban or
hydrologically sensitive area over a prolonged period.
Thunderstorms are a hazard today as well and given lowered
freezing levels lightning, small hail, and a few stronger wind
gusts are the primary concerns. Thunderstorm potential should be
rather limited early this morning but should increase into the
15-25% chance range over the Bay Area by this afternoon and
perhaps the Central Coast by this evening. Additional rain amounts
for most areas will be in the 0.25"-0.5" range, with around 1" in
the orographically favorable coastal ranges. Localized heavier
amounts remain possible for localized areas that receive
thunderstorms however. Temperatures today will top out in the 50s
(North Bay) to lower 60s elsewhere. Lows tonight will dip into the
mid to upper 40s.

.LONG TERM...

No changes to the long term forecast. The previous discussion is
included below.

LONG TERM...
(Tuesday night through next Sunday)
Issued at 116 PM PST Mon Feb 19 2024

Conditions begin to dry out Wednesday, yet cannot rule out an
isolated rain shower or two early in the day. Dry conditions will
prevail Wednesday night into Thursday before unsettled weather
returns to the North Bay. Unsettled conditions return region-wide by
Friday and Saturday, yet most rainfall will be "beneficial" and
is not expected to result in any widespread flooding concerns.

Temperatures will remain slightly below seasonal averages for
afternoon highs and slightly above for overnight lows throughout the
remainder of the week.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 359 AM PST Tue Feb 20 2024

Currently seeing a few scattered rain showers across the region with
more located just beyond our marine zones. Confidence is high
that all terminals will see rain showers on station during the TAF
period, confidence is much lower on the timing of these rain
showers as they will again be convective in nature. Thunderstorms
remain possible again today; however, they will be much more
isolated in nature than what we saw yesterday, thus again
confidence was too low to explicitly include in the TAFs at this
point. Because of all of this convective nature, ceilings and
visibilities look to frequently oscillate between MVFR and VFR
with the passing of rain showers. Rain and thunderstorm chances
wane into the early morning hours of Wednesday.

Vicinity of SFO...Currently VFR with breezy southerly flow. Rain
showers will impact the terminal today, briefly reducing visibility
and the ceiling. Thunderstorms are still possible today; however,
there is too low of confidence in location and timing to include
in the TAF at this point. Winds continue their diminishing trend,
becoming southwesterly this afternoon before returning southerly
again tonight.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...Currently VFR with breezy drainage flow at
both terminals. Ceilings and visibilities will be transient with the
coming and going of rain showers. Best chances for rain showers
looks to be late this afternoon into this evening.

&&

.MARINE...
(Today through Sunday)
Issued at 359 AM PST Tue Feb 20 2024

Scattered rain, thunderstorms, and gusty conditions will continue
across the coastal waters today. There still remains a chance for
isolated strong thunderstorms, waterspouts, and small hail
throughout today, with best chances being in the afternoon to
evening timeframe. Rain showers will wane into the night before a
return to fair and calm weather Wednesday. Wave heights will
continue to decrease through the end of the work week.

&&

.BEACHES...
Issued at 944 PM PST Mon Feb 19 2024

A high surf advisory is in effect through 4 AM Tuesday.

Large and moderate period westerly swell continues to bring large
breaking waves to area beaches. Breaking waves of 18-22 feet
remain possible at west-facing beaches into early Tuesday morning,
with favored areas such as steep beaches seeing locally higher
breaking wave heights. Remember to never turn your back on the
ocean, as large waves can sweep across the beach without warning,
pulling people into the sea from rocks, jetties, and beaches.
These waves can also move large objects such as logs, crushing
anyone caught underneath.
