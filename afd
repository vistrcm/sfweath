...New UPDATE, MARINE...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 226 AM PDT Wed Oct 30 2024

Rain chances increase again today as a cold front moves through
late tonight into tomorrow morning. Below average temperatures
persist into the weekend.

.UPDATE...
Issued at 844 AM PDT Wed Oct 30 2024

Brrr...as noted below it was a chilly start to the day. No only
did interior locations drop into the 30s a few remote spots in San
Benito county hit the upper 20s.

The bigger story for today will be the return of rain. The KMUX
radar has already been put back into precip mode. A few light
showers were detected over the North Bay, but these are more scout
showers ahead of the main cold front farther to the north. Expect
a few more pre-frontal showers ahead of the front through out the
rest of the day. Per the latest timing from ensemble guidance,
the highest likelihood for steadier rainfall won`t occur until
late this afternoon and moreso this evening. Impacts to the
evening commute will be most likely over the North Bay.
Therefore, Wednesday will be more dry than actually wet.

No update needed at this time...

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 226 AM PDT Wed Oct 30 2024

Below average temperatures continue today with rain chances
increasing north to south across the Bay Area and Central Coast late
this afternoon/early evening. Overnight temperatures are running
about 2 to 5 degrees lower tonight than they were at this time
yesterday thanks to widespread clear skies and increased radiational
cooling. Most sites will see morning lows in the 40s while the North
Bay valleys and interior Monterey and San Benito counties will drop
into the 30s. High temperatures today are about 5 to 15 degrees
below average with highs in the 60s across the interior and upper
50s to low 60s along the coast.

Let`s go back to the star of our short term forecast: the return of
rain this afternoon. Shortwave ridging is currently located over the
West Coast but is not expected to remain long as an upper level
trough moves into the PNW today and ejects the ridge eastwards. This
trough is associated with a strong surface low pressure system
located in the Gulf of Alaska. While the actual low pressure system
stays well to our north, its cold front extends farther south and is
set to reach the Bay Area late this evening/overnight. High clouds
ahead of the front have already started to reach our CWA with the
amount of mid and low level clouds to gradually increase through the
afternoon/evening hours as the front approaches. Similarly,
precipitation chances gradually increase ahead of frontal passage
during the early to late morning across the North Bay, during the
afternoon over the rest of the Bay Area, and during the evening over
the Central Coast. Showers look to be more widespread/stratiform
ahead of the front and become more scattered after frontal passage.
When might this transition from more widespread to scattered showers
occur? The front is expected to move through the Bay Area late
Wednesday night into early Thursday morning and to move through the
Central Coast by late Thursday morning. The highest rain chances
will be Wednesday afternoon into Wednesday night with most sites
seeing around 0.1" of rain. Areas across the North Bay and areas
where upsloping is favored against elevated terrain (Santa Cruz
Mountains, East Bay Hills) will see locally higher amounts. In fact,
portions of the North Bay coastal mountains may even see up to half
an inch of rain. By late Thursday morning the front should be well
to the south of our area, but, this does not spell the end of our
precipitation chances for the week.

.LONG TERM...
(Thursday through Tuesday)
Issued at 226 AM PDT Wed Oct 30 2024

After Wednesday`s cold frontal passage, showers will become more
scattered and accumulation amounts will trend downwards through late
Thursday morning/into the afternoon. While drizzly conditions are
expected to continue through the evening, particularly for the North
Bay, any accumulations will be light and shouldn`t impede on any
Halloween activities. This forecaster hopes that most will find any
lingering drizzle adds to the spooky ambiance of the day rather than
detracting from it. Moving on, we will see widespread precipitation
chances increase again late week with a potentially more substantial
rain event taking shape Friday into Saturday. The initial upper
level trough that is bringing us rain Wednesday into Thursday is
expected to deepen and move southward. Correspondingly, the surface
low pressure system will also move southward and eventually make its
way into the PNW Friday. This will allow a second cold front to move
through Northern/Central California and bring widespread rain
chances Friday morning through Saturday afternoon. Most sites in our
CWA, outside of favored locations, are currently expected to see up
to half an inch of rain from this system (the most many of us have
received since May). Across the North Bay, totals will be higher
with the potential for up to 1" of rain across the region as a whole
with some spots set to receive locally higher totals. Probabilistic
NBM guidance shows a 60 to 80% chance that totals across the coastal
North Bay Mountains will exceed an inch of rain during this event.
That being said, we are still seeing some fluctuations in
precipitation totals (notably decreasing slightly over the most
recent model runs) so expect some variation in the final amounts as
we get closer to the main event. Locally gusty onshore winds are
expected, particularly across elevated terrain and gaps and passes
where gusts up to 30 mph are possible. Temperature wise, no major
changes to the temperature forecast described in the short term
through Saturday with below average temperatures to continue.

The pattern is expected to shift back to warmer and drier conditions
Sunday through the end of the forecast period. As upper level
troughing moves to the south and east of us, it will continue to
strengthen with both the European and GFS models showing a cut off
low developing in the Four Corners region. At the same time, a
positively tilted ridge will build over the West Coast. This will
increase the potential for strong offshore wind development over the
Bay Area and Central Coast, raising some potential fire weather
concerns early next week. Some uncertainty remains as to how long
elevated fire weather conditions will persist. For example, looking
at cluster guidance we can clusters that are weighted more heavily
towards the European and Canadian ensembles keep the cut off low
lingering later into the week compared to clusters that are more
heavily weighted towards the GFS. If the cut off low does end up
lingering into mid to late week, that would allow fire weather
concerns to persist for a longer period of time compared to if the
cut off low only lingered through the early week. All together, this
serves as a reminder that, despite a few early season rounds of
rain, fire season is still active and ongoing.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 452 AM PDT Wed Oct 30 2024

VFR throughout this afternoon. Deteriorating conditions this evening
across the North Bay and then points southward trough Thursday
morning. Dry conditions this morning with increasing westerly winds
this afternoon. A cold front approaches from the northwest later
Wednesday with increasing clouds and rain arriving over the North
Bay late in the day resulting in MVFR conditions. MVFR (to at times
IFR) conditions are forecast to spread southward throughout the
early morning hours on Thursday.

Vicinity of SFO...Westerly winds less than 10 knots become light
and variable early Wednesday morning. Southwest wind near 10 knots
developing Wednesday afternoon shifting to southeast by early
evening ahead of an approaching frontal boundary. This boundary
will result in increasing chances for rain between 03Z-06Z
Thursday and then continuing through about 09Z. Conditions are
expected to gradually improve thereafter.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...Light southerly winds have developed over
the region this morning, generally less than 3 kt. West winds near
10 knots develop by Wednesday afternoon and continue into the early
evening. Southerly winds are forecast ahead of an approaching
frontal boundary that will move through after 09Z Thursday. This will
bring light rain to the region through the end of the current
forecast period.

.MARINE...
(Today through Monday)
Issued at 844 AM PDT Wed Oct 30 2024

A cold front will move across the waters late this afternoon and
evening bringing rain to the region. This rain will move from
north to south across the region and begin to taper off Thursday
morning. Northwesterly winds will build to a fresh breeze and
reintroduce rough seas through the day Thursday and into Friday. A
second cold front brings more rain Friday and Saturday.

     for SF Bay N of Bay Bridge.
