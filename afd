...New UPDATE, MARINE...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 405 AM PDT Tue Apr 8 2025

Pleasant spring weather is expected through the extended forecast.
The warmest days will be Wednesday and Thursday with inland
temperatures in the 70s and 80s, and 60s near the coast.

&&

.UPDATE...
Issued at 838 AM PDT Tue Apr 8 2025

Fog is the primary short term hazard this morning, particularly in
coastal and valley locations. Visible satellite imagery does show
a trend in the right direction with fog beginning to dissipate
with the help of offshore/downslope winds. Other than that, the
forecast remains on track with no updates needed at this time.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 405 AM PDT Tue Apr 8 2025

Zonal upper level synoptic flow will begin to gradually transition
into amplified ridging today and begin a pleasant spring warming
trend. Weak onshore flow at the surface will allow scattered low
level stratus to linger along portions of the coast most of the day
with more clearing inland. Temperatures will be close to normal
along the coast and at or slightly above normal for the rest of our
area. As the upper ridge begins to amplify and axis develops to our
east, we`ll see weak offshore flow develop overnight limiting low
stratus development overnight and more mild overnight lows into
early Wednesday morning that we`re seeing early this morning.

&&

.LONG TERM...
(Wednesday through Monday)
Issued at 405 AM PDT Tue Apr 8 2025

As the upper level ridging pattern continues to amplify through the
middle of the week we`ll see the warmest temperatures tomorrow and
Thursday with weak offshore flow limiting marine layer development
along the coast. Mostly sunny skies inland will see temperatures in
the 70s to low 80s especially the farther south you go into the
valleys of the Central Coast. A return of weak onshore flow out
ahead of a developing trough late Wednesday into Thursday will
result in more low level stratus development Wednesday night and
Thursday morning from the Santa Cruz mountains north into the North
Bay. A return of boundary layer offshore flow late Thursday and
Friday will limit marine layer development once again. There may be
some coastal drizzle where the marine layer is able to develop but
otherwise the forecast is dry through the extended forecast area
wide. Cooler temperatures closer to normal for this time of year can
be expected by next weekend as the upper level ridging shifts to our
east.
