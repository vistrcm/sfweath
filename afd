.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 230 AM PDT Mon Aug 21 2023

An unsettled weather pattern is expected today with cooler
temperatures, scattered showers, and even a few thunderstorms. The
best rain chances are for inland portions of the Central Coast and
East Bay, but can`t rule out low-end chances elsewhere. Warmer and
drier conditions return for mid week with high pressure in
control.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 230 AM PDT Mon Aug 21 2023

Moisture channel imagery early this morning is rather picturesque.
The cloud shield from now Post-tropical Cyclone Hilary was evident
across California and the Great Basin, with mid to high level clouds
carried by the jet stream across the entire northern CONUS. An
expansive and seasonally anomalous (601 decameter) high pressure
ridge was located over the central Great Plains, with our ever
persistent upper low still pinwheeling offshore from the Bay Area.
Surface analysis revealed the low-level center of Hilary was located
just west of Death Valley National Park, with a poleward mass flux
across SoCal. The blended total Precipitable Water (PW) product
shows this nicely, with PW values around 2 inches to the south and
east of the low-level circulation. Farther north, some moisture
was also caught around the upper low with precipitable water
values of 1 to 1.25 inches. Showers were ongoing to our east
(within Hilary`s moisture plume) and offshore to our west (around
the upper low). Dry conditions prevailed locally, at least for the
time being.

For today, the low-level remnants from Hilary will accelerate north
into the Great Basin as the upper low wobbles onshore. Rich mid-
level moisture will accompany the low and spread inland across the
Bay Area and Central coast during the morning to early afternoon
hours. Lapse rates should steepen appreciably given a cold pocket
aloft (500 mb temps of -10 to -12 deg C) associated with the upper
low. Surface dewpoints in the lower 60s juxtaposed with near moist
adiabatic lapse rates should produce modest instability within a
focused corridor from Mt Hamilton south into San Benito and
eastern Monterey Counties. Afternoon mixed layer CAPE of 300-500
J/kg is suggested per RAP proximity soundings with effective bulk
shear of 20-25 kt. This should result isolated to scattered wet
thunderstorms most focused on the Diablo range with storm
morphologies favoring loosely organized multicell clusters.
Occasional lightning, brief heavy rain, and small hail should be
the primary concerns with briefly gusty winds possible around any
of the stronger/taller cores. The primary window for more
widespread convective development should be from around 20-00Z
(1pm-5pm PDT) before convection pushes east into the Sacramento
Valley. Otherwise isolated to widely scattered showers are
possible across the remainder of the area from the mid to late
morning hours into this evening. Rain amounts overall should be
light, although a few spots could pick up 0.25 inches or greater
if they happen to be where a heavier shower or thunderstorm
develops. High temperatures will be on the cool side, with
readings generally in the 70s to lower 80s region wide. A few
areas bordering the Sacramento Valley could climb into the mid to
upper 80s if enough sunshine breaks through the higher cloud deck.
Overnight lows will generally be around 60 or so. Locally breezy
southerly winds are expected this afternoon, especially along the
Big Sur coast and Monterey Peninsula where gusts of 30 to 45 mph
are expected this afternoon.

.LONG TERM...
(Tuesday through Sunday)
Issued at 230 AM PDT Mon Aug 21 2023

The pesky upper low will finally become absorbed within a southwest
flow regime early in the period with drying conditions aloft. This
will allow the high pressure ridge to flex into our area by mid
week with a warming trend. Eastern pacific troughing returns for
late week and the weekend with cooling temperatures and a deepening
marine layer.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 459 AM PDT Mon Aug 21 2023

572 decameter height 500 mb low center with pocket of cold air aloft
for August is approx 75 miles west of the Monterey Peninsula, the
warmer side of the 500 mb low is to our east merging with tropical
moisture; per KMUX data our forecast area is bookended by radar echoes
both west and east. Will continue to monitor radar and satellite data
since the area of showers and 500 mb thermal trough with the 500 mb
low center to our west is forecast to move across our cwa today.

Coastal profiler data showed the lower levels warmed via compression,
pushing downward the marine layer depth to near sea level Sunday,
along the boundary of the tropical moisture to our east, fully mixing
out coastal stratus and fog. However, more recent profiler data shows
near surface cooling taking place with the marine layer deepening and
coastal stratus and fog /IFR/ are redeveloping per satellite imagery
and surface observations.

Also monitoring the SMX-SFO & SBA-SFO pressure gradients which in
the last few hours have strengthened since a meso-scale surface high
has developed over southern California due to recent rain cooled air,
increasing surface pressures to our south. Stratus can be seen moving
north around Point Conception with the increasing southerly winds, with
southerly breezes also showing up more recently along the Big Sur Coast
to the Monterey Peninsula. Will continue to closely watch how the
southerly winds develop in response to the southerly pressure gradient,
this usually brings a local downsloping, drying southwesterly wind to
KMRY for example, at some point later in the morning the southerly
winds helping to mix out the stratus along with gusty southwesterly
winds developing at KMRY, gusty northwesterly winds developing at KSNS.
In this flow pattern KSNS almost always see the stratus return first
late in the day vs KMRY.

Vicinity of SFO...VFR. A few showers developing today with the incoming
500 mb thermal trough. Wind westerly shifting to southerly by 17z today
and increasingly gusty, peak gusts to 20 to 30 knots. Wind decreasing
to 5 to 10 knots tonight, and showers ending tonight since the trough
will have moved east of the area.

SFO Bridge Approach...Wildfire smoky and hazy conditions arrive today
from far northwest California and southwest Oregon per recent high
resolution model forecasts. Slant range visibility may be reduced
especially at sunrise and sunset. Otherwise similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...IFR in stratus, patchy fog though increasing
winds will help mix out fog this morning. Southerly winds are reaching
the Monterey Peninsula, eventually bringing downsloping, drying to
reduce cloud cover during the morning. The 500 mb thermal trough
has consolidation to it as it passes by today, showers are in the
forecast, and may need to add thunder to the TAFs for later today;
convection moves eastward out of the forecast area tonight. Winds
light and variable through morning, becoming onshore 10 to 20 knots
this afternoon then decreasing to around 10 knots tonight.

.MARINE...
(Today through Saturday)
Issued at 429 AM PDT Mon Aug 21 2023

An upper level low is located over the coastal waters resulting in
scattered showers and isolated thunderstorms. The low with
additional instability will slowly move eastward reaching the
north Central Coast this morning then the Bay Area this afternoon
and evening. Southerly winds will increase and become gusty to
gale force along the Big Sur Coast to the Monterey Peninsula this
morning and afternoon in response to recently rain cooled air and
higher surface pressure over southern California. The winds will
result in fresh wind driven seas today. The upper level low will
move northeast away from our forecast area late tonight through
Tuesday. Winds will ease on Tuesday, returning to the more usual
summer northwesterly winds.
