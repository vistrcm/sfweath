...New SYNOPSIS, SHORT TERM, LONG TERM, AVIATION, MARINE...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 437 AM PDT Sun Jun 4 2023

One more day of warm and dry weather for this Sunday as high
pressure ridging persists. A stark pattern change arrives by early
Monday as an upper level low brings unsettled conditions and cooler
weather for the first half of this week. Confidence is increasing in
showers and the potential for thunderstorms impacting the region
Monday and Tuesday.

&&

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 437 AM PDT Sun Jun 4 2023

Ridging aloft will continue to bring warm and dry conditions today.
The marine layer remains compressed at around 700 ft near the Bodega
Bay profiler and between 1000-1200 ft near the Fort Ord Profiler.
Similar satellite imagery to last night where most of the low marine
stratus is from the SF Peninsula southward through the Big Sur
coastline, however, stratus is starting to fill in a little more to
the north near Pt Reyes. The inland intrusion of the stratus is
somewhat limited to the immediate coastal areas.
With the exception of the Monterey Bay region (stratus is pushing
eastward into Corralitos, Aromas, San Juan Batista, Prunedale, and
is filling the Salinas Valley to the south of King City. Expect
those clouds to scatter out by late morning/early afternoon similar
to yesterday. In fact, much of today will be similar to yesterday as
we get another day of above normal temperatures for inland areas and
the onshore winds pick up in the afternoon/evening hours for breezy
conditions. The synoptic ridging pattern aloft will weaken by
tonight as an upper level low develops over the Eastern Pacific
Ocean off the shore of SoCal.

.LONG TERM...
(Monday through Saturday)
Issued at 437 AM PDT Sun Jun 4 2023

Monday marks a noticeable pattern change for our CWA. The upper
level low will nudge inland Monday morning and will stay centered
over SoCal thru midweek. Monday and Tuesday are the days to be most
weather aware as that low will have moisture wrapping around it
coupled with increasing instability. As mentioned in yesterday
evening`s update, the EFI (extreme forecast index) is signaling
that the incoming precipitation early this week will be quite
anomalous. There is increasing confidence, not just in showers,
but also in the unstable atmosphere. The NBM potential for
thunderstorms has increased in the past 24 hours and our region
now has a 15 to 25 percent chance for thunderstorm development on
Monday and Tuesday. The NAM is indicating that we could see about
2 rounds of convection: Monday morning (primarily in Monterey and
San Benito counties), Monday evening continuing into early Tuesday
morning (for our whole CWA). SPC now has practically all of
Central CA and NorCal in their mention of general thunderstorms
for both Monday and Tuesday. Looking at model soundings, there`s
the potential for small hail in some of these showers and/or
thunderstorms so have added that to our weather grids. In terms of
rain totals for Monday and Tuesday, WPC guidance has increased
those amounts. Due to the showery nature of this pattern, some
locations, especially North Bay, may only see a few hundredths.
However, WPC has a range of 0.05" to 0.25" from Santa Cruz county,
South Bay and into Monterey and San Benito counties. Localized
areas could see 0.30" up to 0.50", especially if thunderstorms
develop with moderate to heavy downpours.

Things to remember for Monday and Tuesday: wet roads always
increase the chance for spinouts and accidents so take it slow,
small hail can accumulate on roads and make for very slick
conditions, take shelter immediately if you hear thunder or see
lightning.

For Wednesday into Saturday: That upper level low will weaken and
transition into a larger scale open trough. This will maintain the
cooler than normal pattern. Shower activity is likely to continue
well east of our CWA (over the Sierra) and in far NorCal, however,
our region should stay fairly dry.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 437 AM PDT Sun Jun 4 2023

The Bay Area terminals are a mixed bag as low clouds are flirting
with APC, SFO and OAK at this hour. If MVFR CIGS do develop at
SFO and OAK, expect it to occur in the 12-15z window. APC may see
lowered CIGs and patchy fog bringing them into the MVFR category
around 14Z, but expecting to return to VFR towards 16Z. Meanwhile
the Monterey Bay region continues to be impacted with IFR/LIFR
CIGS due to the inland push of marine stratus. Light onshore winds
continue this morning for the TAF sites until they become breezy
again this afternoon around 20z or later. By 18-20Z Sunday and the
rest of the afternoon, forecast indicates a return of widespread
VFR for the region.

Vicinity of SFO...VFR persists with MVFR CIGs possible between
13-15Z as coastal stratus lingers west of the terminal. There`s
approximately a 55% of going to MVFR in that window, though with
a compressed marine layer due to higher pressure over the area,
confidence on this is medium. Have included in the TAF at this
time, but something to keep an eye on. Onshore winds are starting
to decrease and will continue that trend overnight. However, winds
are forecast to increase again Sunday afternoon.

SFO Bridge Approach...The approach is clear and VFR. Main concern
will be if CIGs develop at OAK and then fill into the Bay in the
13-15Z window.

Monterey Bay Terminals...MRY and SNS are a mix of LIFR and IFR,
respectively. Expecting a return to MVFR during the 18-19Z hour
on Sunday, then clearing to a short window of VFR in the late
afternoon to early evening as westerly to northwesterly winds
increase.

&&

.MARINE...
(Today through Friday)
Issued at 437 AM PDT Sun Jun 4 2023

Continued northerly gale force gusts impacting the northern outer
waters north of Pigeon Point through Sunday afternoon before
gradually weakening. These strong gusts are generating steep wind
waves that may be hazardous to small craft. Moderate to longer
period southerly swell (14 to 17 seconds) persists in the
background through much of the week ahead. A low pressure system
arriving Monday and Tuesday will bring showers to the bays and
coastal waters.

&&

.MTR WATCHES/WARNINGS/ADVISORIES...
CA...None.
PZ...Small Craft Advisory until 9 AM PDT this morning for PZZ540-575.

     Gale Warning until 3 PM PDT this afternoon for PZZ570.
