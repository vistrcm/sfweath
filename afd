.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 351 AM PST Mon Jan 1 2024

Happy January 1, 2024! from the midnight shift crew! Residual low
clouds and a few patches of fog are seen on satellite imagery
early this morning. With clearing aloft, nocturnal radiative
cooling to space is increasing the chances of patchy dense fog
developing through daybreak. Drier weather will otherwise settle
in today and tonight with a high pressure system moving in from
the west. Daytime highs today reaching the upper 50s to lower 60s.
Lows tonight and Tuesday morning mainly in the 40s except for a
few 30s across the far inland valleys.

from the northwest bringing widespread rain Tuesday and Tuesday
night with showery weather lingering Wednesday. Gusty southerly
winds will also develop with this low pressure system Tuesday.
Dry weather returns late Wednesday and Thursday, then a quickly
southeastward moving low pressure system brings another chance of
rain Friday with another system on its heels arriving Saturday.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 359 AM PST Mon Jan 1 2024

KAPC and KLVK terminals this morning are seeing IFR conditions as a
result of mist and fog reducing visibilities. Elsewhere and broadly
speaking, conditions are VFR and expected to last through the end of
the TAF period. The aforementioned terminals seeing fog this morning
will see VFR conditions return into the late morning hours today,
with VFR lasting through the end of the TAF period. Some hints
towards a redevelopment of mist and fog exist for the early morning
hours of Tuesday for North Bay terminals and KLVK, though confidence
on this is low at this time. Winds generally below 10 knots and
variable through the TAF period.


Vicinity of SFO...VFR through the TAF period, winds below 10 knots
and out of the NW Monday afternoon. Winds decrease to become light
and variable into the late night Monday.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...VFR through the TAF period. Light NW winds
in the afternoon Monday, becoming variable into the night.

.MARINE...
(Today through Saturday)
Issued at 245 AM PST Mon Jan 1 2024

Radar this morning shows just a handful of small showers off the
Monterey county coastline. Long period northwest swell lasts
through the late week with a new northwest swell train arriving
into next weekend. Winds turn to become southerly and gusty
Tuesday morning as the next rain system approaches, bringing
widespread rain across the waters. These increased southerly
winds will create hazardous small craft conditions lasting through
the late week.

.BEACHES...
Issued at 359 AM PST Mon Jan 1 2024

A Beach Hazards statement is in effect through New Year`s Day
through the evening. Long period NW swell is moving through the
waters increasing the risk for sneaker waves at W and NW facing
beaches. Large waves can sweep across the beach without warning,
pulling people into the sea from rocks, jetties and beaches. Never
turn your back on the ocean!
