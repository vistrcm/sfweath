...New SYNOPSIS, UPDATE...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 512 AM PDT Tue Oct 3 2023

Conditions are favoring coastal dense fog this morning, a dense
fog advisory is in effect until 10 am today. Daytime temperatures
will be much warmer to hotter mainly Wednesday through Saturday
as a result of strengthening high pressure and large scale sinking
air. Surface high pressure developing over the Great Basin will
result in downsloping, warming and drying offshore breezes to the
Bay Area coastline this week. Expect well above early October
normal daily high temperatures developing this week, though are
likely to stay below record highs at the long term sites. Nightly
temperatures will cool somewhat in relatively drier air and
lengthening night-time hours. Cooler onshore breezes returning to
the forecast area late in the weekend and early next week.

.UPDATE...
Issued at 523 AM PDT Tue Oct 3 2023

A dense fog advisory is in effect until 10 am today for the immediate
coastline from the coastal North Bay to the Big Sur Coast except along
the northern Monterey Bay. A compressing marine layer and nocturnal
cooling to space are combining to form occasional dense fog with the
visibility below 1/4 mile mixing with low stratus ceilings. By late
morning surface warming and increasing atmospheric mixing will lift
the fog, resulting in improving visibilities today.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 325 AM PDT Tue Oct 3 2023

A 500 mb long wave ridge i.e. large scale compressional warming over
the eastern Pacific continues to slowly advance eastward over our
forecast area this morning. Profiler data shows slow, steady warming
aloft with the marine layer depth varying between 700 and 1000 feet.
Coastal fog and stratus continue to develop since Monday evening, inland
it`s clear with exception of a few passing cirrus clouds. Once the sun
rises surface warming will commence, mixing out the coastal fog and
stratus, temperatures warming up a few degrees more than on Monday.
Highs today varying from the upper 60s to mid 70s coastside and bayside
to the upper 70s to mid 80s, warmest farthest inland.

.LONG TERM...
(Wednesday through Monday)
Issued at 325 AM PDT Tue Oct 3 2023

Warmer to hotter daytime temperatures beginning Wednesday and lasting
through late week. The NAM model forecasts the WMC-SFO pressure gradient
to near 10 mb each morning Wednesday through Friday, gusty northeast
winds developing in the North Bay hills and mountains Tuesday night
into Wednesday morning for example, then a little less organized
northeasterly winds developing nightly later in the week with the 500
mb ridge becoming more disorganized over our forecast area. Winds and
humidity nearing marginal fire weather concerns, though fuel moistures
are still relatively elevated for the time of year. For what it`s worth,
precipitable water is not forecast to lower much during the week like
it could during an offshore wind pattern. Late in the weekend and early
next week onshore breezes return along with cooler temperatures.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 449 AM PDT Tue Oct 3 2023

VFR through the TAF period for all but the Monterey Bay terminals
and along the immediate coast which will see low CIGs and areas of
fog through the late morning. The building ridge pattern will
limit surface winds over the next few days, leading to light and
variable winds overnight, and light to moderate winds during the
day.

Vicinity of SFO...VFR through the TAF period. Expect light and
variable wind overnight that will become moderate for Tuesday
afternoon. Expect light and variable winds again for Tuesday night.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO

Monterey Bay Terminals...Low CIGS with pockets of mist and fog
last through much of the morning. Winds stay light and variable
for MRY through the TAF period, while SNS sees moderate winds
build as VFR returns in the afternoon. Winds become light again
for SNS in the late evening.

&&

.MARINE...
(Today through Sunday)
Issued at 234 AM PDT Tue Oct 3 2023

Breezy Northwest winds continue into midweek, but will reduce and
become light for the late week. Moderate period southerly swell 12
to 14 seconds persists through the week, alongside a shorter
period northwesterly swell at 8 to 10 seconds. A Longer period
northwesterly swell moves into the waters today but becomes
moderate into the end of the week.
