...New AVIATION...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 300 AM PDT Thu May 25 2023

Unseasonably cool conditions to persist into next week. Night and
morning low clouds will give way to sunny conditions across the
interior each afternoon.

&&

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 300 AM PDT Thu May 25 2023

An upper level low remains over eastern Oregon and northern Idaho
this morning with a trailing trough axis extending into central
California. As such, stratus has once again filled into much of
the region with temperatures generally holding in the low/mid 50s
at this hour. These conditions are very similar to the past few
days with little change anticipated in the next 24 hours or so. In
addition, patchy drizzle/mist expected near coastal areas once
again this morning. After sunrise, low cloud cover will begin to
dissipate inland and retreat back to the coast by the afternoon.
With that, some coastal areas will remain under the cloud cover
through much of the day with temperatures only warming into the
upper 50s to low 60s. Inland, expecting temperatures to warm into
the 60s to low/mid 70s. For tonight, a near repeat with low clouds
returning inland.

&&

.LONG TERM...
(Friday through Wednesday)
Issued at 300 AM PDT Thu May 25 2023

While the aforementioned trough is forecast to shift slightly
inland this weekend, it appears to be replaced by yet another
trough and ultimately a cut-off upper level low by Memorial day.
Thus, daytime temperatures look to remain below seasonal averages
through the forecast period with little day-to-day change in
weather conditions. Look for widespread night and morning clouds
giving way to inland sunshine each afternoon with temperatures
running a few to as much as 15 deg F below normal for late May.
Forecast ensembles are in good agreement with a troughing pattern
then persisting into the start of June.|

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 422 AM PDT Thu May 25 2023

Widespread stratus creates MVFR cigs over all terminals, with a
possibility of IFR ceilings in the North Bay, but with low
confidence, it was not included in the TAFs. High confidence that
VFR will return between 17-19Z this morning but MVFR ceilings will
return again tonight. Moderate confidence on timing of returning
stratus as models lack agreement, but expect a return near 3-6Z
tonight. Onshore winds will become breeze late morning/early
afternoon and gradually becoming light to moderate tonight. Low
confidence on wind direction for KSJC but following persistence,
winds are expected to remain S/SW with a chance that winds will
change to W/NW this between 0Z-8Z.

Vicinity of SFO...Satellite shows stratus filled in over the
terminal and is pretty socked in. Therefore, MVFR with an
anticipated clearing time near 20Z with a return of MVFR tonight.
There is a chance clearing might occur a few hours later as
models lack agreement. Winds will become breezy late this morning
up to 15 KT with high confidence that winds will remain W/SW.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...MVFR conditions are expected to linger
until early this morning (~17Z) where conditions will improve to VFR
until tonight where onshore winds brings stratus over land again and
becomes socked in over Monterey Bay.

&&

.MARINE...
(Today through Tuesday)
Issued at 300 AM PDT Thu May 25 2023

Winds continue to diminish across the waters, yet will become
breezy each afternoon, especially across the northern outer waters
and over the San Francisco Bay. A long period southerly swell
remains in the background through the remainder of the week. Winds
expected to increase again across the waters towards the weekend
as the troughing pattern remains and another upper low deepens
over the central California coast.

&&

.MTR WATCHES/WARNINGS/ADVISORIES...
CA...None.
PZ...Small Craft Advisory from 3 PM this afternoon to 3 AM PDT Friday
     for PZZ530.

     Small Craft Advisory until 9 AM PDT this morning for PZZ570.
