...New AVIATION, MARINE...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 915 PM PDT Wed Oct 2 2024

Hot and dry conditions continue with dangerous heat and potentially
critical fire weather conditions for the remainder of the work
week. The heatwave did peak the last couple of days, but impacts
from Moderate to Extreme HeatRisk at times, will be felt into the
weekend. The beginning of next week does hint at relief from the
heatwave, however temperatures are still slightly above normal
for interior locations toward the end of the extended forecast.

&&

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 322 AM PDT Thu Oct 3 2024

Key Points:
* Dangerous heat continues to impact almost the entire forecast
  area
* A mix of Heat Advisories and Excessive Heat Warnings currently
  in effect
* Limited overnight cooling in the hills - upper 70s to near 90
* Red Flag Warning and Near Critical Fire Weather Conditions (see
  fire weather section below)

Hot and dry weather will prevail across almost the entire forecast
area again today with a deep warm to hot layer of air found not too
far up due to a strong high pressure system aloft. Early October
solar input i.e. surface heating will quickly connect again with
the warm to hot lower level temperature inversion sending temperatures
upwards to well above normal and near a few record highs. Minimal
offshore winds in this pattern is otherwise currently allowing a 200
to 400 feet shallow marine layer along the immediate coastline.

Satellite shows the leading edge of a narrow band of stratus and
fog reaching near Point Conception at this early hour. No sign of
a SBA-SFO or SMX-SFO southerly pressure gradient quite yet (southerly
wind potential) however will closely monitor it. Recent 00z/06z high
resolution rapid refresh forecasts appear to have resolved this cloud
cover so far, showing cloud cover advancing northward through late
week.

&&

.LONG TERM...
(Friday through Wednesday)
Issued at 322 AM PDT Thu Oct 3 2024

The westerlies moving across the Pacific Northwest will tend to
nudge the aforementioned high pressure system forward a little,
otherwise the system will remain approx stationary with long wave
ridging over the southwestern states. Slightly decreasing then
increasing 500 mb heights and compressional warming will occur
through late week and weekend, similarly influencing temperatures.
It`ll remain hot and dry with some easing of daily temperatures
along the way through the weekend. By early next week expect cooling
with weak 500 mb height troughing approaching from the west. Good
news is if waiting patiently for less hot weather inland, HeatRisk
will largely decrease across the forecast area early next week.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 430 AM PDT Thu Oct 3 2024

VFR through the TAF period, high confidence. Winds are generally
light to calm this morning. Expect winds to increase this afternoon
to become around 10 knots out of the W/NW generally. Winds then
weaken into the nighttime to become light, but remain onshore for
the majority of terminals.

Vicinity of SFO...VFR through the TAF period. Current light NW winds
will increase to around 12 knots this afternoon as the seabreeze
begins. Winds ease into the night to become light.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...Winds are currently calm at KMRY, and light
at KSNS where they are flowing out of the SE. Expected onshore NW
winds to return in the afternoon today, generally around 10-12 knots
for KSNS, and below 10 knots for KMRY. Light SE winds return in the
evening for KMRY and KSNS.

&&

.MARINE...
(Today through Tuesday)
Issued at 430 AM PDT Thu Oct 3 2024

Moderate northwesterly winds are expected to persist through at
least Friday before increasing to become fresh Saturday and
becoming more northerly. Rough seas in the northern outer waters
will abate below 10 feet through the day today.

&&

.FIRE WEATHER...
Issued at 309 PM PDT Wed Oct 2 2024
Elevated fire weather will persist through the upcoming weekend.
Dry fuels, hot temperatures, and low humidity are combining to
create a mix of NEAR CRITICAL to CRITICAL fire weather conditions.
One mitigating factor are the relatively light winds. There will
still be periods of offshore flow forecast for the Central Coast
through Thursday evening. Therefore, low end conditions still
warrant the ongoing Red Flag Warning for Zones 517,518,516. We`ll
be monitoring a weak ripple rolling through the upper atmosphere
tonight which should enhance winds at 2,500 over the N Bay, E Bay,
Santa Cruz higher terrain into tomorrow morning.

Still valid: Other concerns from a fire weather perspective are
the fuels. Latest observations suggest critically dry fuels.
Current 100 and 1000 hr fuels are near or slightly below avg, but
trending drying Current 10 hr fuels are critically low as well.
Additionally, latest intel with Live Fuel Moisture shows values
trending toward the 60% threshold. Simply put, fuels are receptive
to fire starts.
