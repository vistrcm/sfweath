.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 248 AM PST Tue Jan 9 2024

Scattered showers this morning and through midweek. Cold overnight
temperatures into the weekend with near Frost/Freeze for inland
areas. Additional rainfall chances this weekend.

&&

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 248 AM PST Tue Jan 9 2024

Radar just starting to show light echoes moving into the northern
stretches of the CWA early this morning as a weak disturbance
moves through our area. A weak surface front will bring a line of
scattered showers moving southward through the region this
morning. Forecast rainfall totals are on the lighter side, with
the coastal ranges in the North Bay expecting around a quarter of
an inch or so. Elsewhere, amounts will be very light with only a
few hundredths to a few tenths. Perhaps the more impactful story
going into tonight/Wednesday morning will be the cold overnight
temperatures. Portions of the southern Salinas Valley, as well as
the North Bay valleys, have about a 30-50% chance of seeing
temperatures of 32 degrees. Elsewhere, overnight lows are expected
to be in the upper 30s to mid-40s.

.LONG TERM...
(Wednesday through Monday)
Issued at 248 AM PST Tue Jan 9 2024

The long term period looks to remain fairly active with strong
storm systems impacting primarily the Pacific Northwest. Another
line of more moderate showers is expected to pass through the area
again Wednesday morning/afternoon with more scattered shower
activity ongoing through the day. Still not expecting much in the
way of impactful amounts, though measurable amounts do look to be
more widespread with the Wednesday system. About a quarter inch
or so for coastal ranges down through the Central Coast, locally
up to a half inch. Elsewhere roughly a couple tenths of an inch.

Looking into the late weekend and early next week; there is still
some uncertainty regarding how key atmospheric features are going
to pan out with a robust stream of moisture progged to impact the
Pacific Northwest. The general consensus currently depicts a
moderate blocking high pressure just off the California coast
keeping most of the strongest moisture transport well to our
north. Ensemble guidance is in good agreement that we will see at
least some rain, especially for counties north of the SF Bay Area,
but waiting to see exactly how the blocking high pressure begins
to play out will paint a clearer picture of just how extensive the
heavier rainfall may be (or not).

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 410 AM PST Tue Jan 9 2024

MVFR and IFR conditions are present around the region this early
morning with IFR being contained largely to the North Bay as a
result of low CIGs. Otherwise, most terminals are currently MVFR and
expected to remain MVFR through at least the late morning to early
afternoon as light rain showers push through and low CIGs persist.
Strong and gusty NW winds will accompany these low CIGs and rain,
with gusts up to 20 knots possible for most terminals. Into the
evening hours tonight, winds begin to slowly decrease to become
light to moderate for most terminals, with rain chances fading and
VFR conditions returning. It is not until just beyond the next TAF
period that the next rounds of rain are expected to occur.


Vicinity of SFO...MVFR CIGs lift to become VFR in the late afternoon
today when rain chances diminish. Any rain received today at the
terminal is expected to be generally light, though slight reductions
in visibilities are expected. Winds strong and gusty out of the
W/NW will gust to around 25 knots, then ease to become moderate in
the late night.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...VFR through at least the early afternoon,
becoming briefly MVFR as rain chances approach the terminals. By the
early evening, VFR returns. Gusty NW winds to around 20-25 knots are
expected in the late afternoon, but slowly ease into the night.
Winds remain elevated longer at KSNS into the night, but ease to
around 9 knots near midnight.

.MARINE...
(Today through Sunday)
Issued at 248 AM PST Tue Jan 9 2024

Gentle to moderate breezes persist through the morning today
before winds increase to become fresh to strong out of the
northwest this afternoon. These stronger winds will persist
through at least Thursday, bringing about dangerous conditions for
small craft. Rain chances will be present over the waters today
through the evening as a weak front pushes through. Additional
rain activity is expected beginning Wednesday morning. Longer
period northwest swell continues to move through the waters this
morning, but becomes more moderate in period towards the weekend.

.BEACHES...
Issued at 853 PM PST Mon Jan 8 2024

King Tides return and peak this week on Wednesday through Friday.
This may result in minor flooding of vulnerable bayside locations
during high tide cycles. A moderate-period northwest swell will
also arrive around mid week, and the combination of elevated surf
and higher tides could lead to minor oceanside flooding as well.
The most likely time for potential impacts is during the mid
morning to mid afternoon hours from mid to late week. Impacts from
this event should not be as severe as those experienced on
December 28-30.

The predicted high tide levels and times for San Francisco are as
follows:

Wednesday January 10: 6.80 ft at 942 AM
Thursday January 11: 6.92 ft at 1030 AM
Friday January 11: 6.88 ft at 1119 AM
