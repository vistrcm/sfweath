...New AVIATION, MARINE, CLIMATE...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 227 AM PST Sat Nov 25 2023

Dry and cool through the weekend. Chance of rain returns for the
middle of next week.

&&

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 227 AM PST Sat Nov 25 2023

Stronger offshore winds at higher elevations have begun to
diminish this morning as the upper low responsible moves out of
the Great Basin and into the middle of the country. On the cooler
side this morning as well with temps generally about 5 to 10
degrees cooler than 24 hours ago, as of writing. Really not much
change going into today other than that. Cool air is in place and
winds continue to be light. Highs in the 60s once again today.
Freeze Warning in effect once again tonight into Sunday morning
for the Southern Salinas Valley and portions of San Benito
county, and a Frost Advisory for the North Bay Valleys.

&&

.LONG TERM...
(Sunday through Friday)
Issued at 227 AM PST Sat Nov 25 2023

Cool air remains in place through the early part of the week with
weak overall flow between two systems. Slight warm up in overnight
temps as we get into the middle of the week with an approaching
upper low from the Pacific. Rain chances also increase by
Wednesday, possibly lingering into the latter half of the week as
a couple of weak disturbances move through. Still a slight degree
of uncertainty regarding rain amounts as the system is expected
to slowly approach the coast and may remain mostly over the
waters. A little less uncertainty from the previous shift though,
as now more than half of ensemble members advertise measurable
precip at SFO.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 402 AM PST Sat Nov 25 2023

VFR continuing due to offshore winds and dry air over the forecast
area.

Vicinity of SFO...VFR. Mainly east to northeast wind 5 to 7 knots
becoming light and variable tonight.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...VFR. Light east to southeast cold air drainage
winds except 10 to 15 knots in the Salinas Valley. Winds temporarily
northwest near 5 knots in the late afternoon.

&&

.MARINE...
(Today through Thursday)
Issued at 230 AM PST Sat Nov 25 2023

Hazardous seas continuing between 10-14 feet through the weekend
with long swell periods. Winds will be relatively light over the
waters through most of the first half of the work week.

&&

.BEACHES...
Issued at 4:00 AM PST Sat Nov 25 2023

Long period waves will be energetic in the surf zone leading to
an increased risk of sneaker waves especially for northwest-facing
beaches. The Beach Hazards Statement remains in effect for the
coastline from Sonoma County down to Monterey County through 8 AM
Sunday. Sneaker wave risk diminishes by Sunday afternoon as swell
period decreases, but the waters may still be turbulent with larger
breaking waves, so caution is still advised. In addition to the
increased sneaker wave risk, high astronomical tides are expected
this weekend, which may bring runup farther along the beach.
Beachgoers and tide poolers should use caution and watch out for
unexpected waves that can sweep you off your feet.

.CLIMATE...
Issued at 310 AM PST Sat Nov 25 2023

25th, Nov 26th and Nov 27th.
