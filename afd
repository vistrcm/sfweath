...New UPDATE, MARINE...

.KEY MESSAGES...
Updated at 410 AM PDT Sun Aug 3 2025

 - Gusty conditions anticipated this afternoon across the marine
   environment, as well as mountain gaps, passes, and the Salinas
   Valley.

 - Subtle warming trend expected through midweek with moderate
   HeatRisk across far interior locations.

.UPDATE...
Issued at 934 AM PDT Sun Aug 3 2025

Stratus continues to erode rapidly this morning, especially
across the North Bay as the marine layer did compress some
compared to roughly 24 hours ago. This has equated to 24 hour
temperature departures running anywhere from 5 to 10 degrees
greater. As such, today`s morning update revolves around adjusting
temperatures upward anywhere from 2 to 5 degrees across the North
Bay, East Bay, and South Bay. Overall, minor HeatRisk is still
anticipated for today. The warmer conditions in tandem with the
enhanced breezes (especially across gaps, passes, channels, and
valleys) will translate to an elevated fire weather threat largely
for grass and shrub vegetation types across these wind corridors.
Peak wind gusts of 30 to 50 mph are forecast in these regions.
Otherwise, the rest of the forecast remains unchanged.

.SHORT TERM...
Issued at 410 AM PDT Sun Aug 3 2025
(Today and tonight)

A stark contrast of mostly clear skies and completely socked in
marine stratus this morning, where it seems like some drier air is
being mixed in from above the marine layer. This trend may largely
continue through the early half of the day where many northern
locations clear out and coastal areas further south hold on to
some cloudiness until the afternoon hours. Still anticipated gusty
conditions this afternoon once the surface low begins to form
over the Great Basin. This will enhance the onshore pressure
gradient giving a boost to our onshore flow. Many areas of the
marine layer should be enhanced by stronger near surface moisture
advection, so we aren`t really expecting any drastic changes to RH
over the event. That being said, conditions will remain dry above
about 2,000 feet where RH recovery will be low. Despite good
onshore flow, any fire start in grasses and fine fuels will have
more than enough to grow rapidly (see Gifford Fire in SLO county).
Peak wind gusts will most likely be in the 35-45 mph range for
favored areas such as Altamont Pass, the Salinas Valley, and
locations near the typically marine coastal jets (e.g., south of
Point Sur and the Marin/Sonoma coast).

.LONG TERM...
Issued at 410 AM PDT Sun Aug 3 2025
(Monday through Saturday)

No notable change to the long term forecast.

PREV DISCUSSION...Enhanced winds near/south of Point Arena and
Point Sur (coastal jets) and across the East Bay interior are
still anticipated through at least noon on Monday. The onshore
flow will keep temperatures in check and very much near what was
noted for Sunday.

The extended forecast period will see a slight change from our
relatively cooler summer that we`ve experienced thus far. While it
doesn`t seem probable that we`ll see an extreme heat event mid-
week, temperatures will rebound to around normal, with some sites
near +10F above climatological normals. This results in pockets
of Moderate HeatRisk, especially across the interior portions of
the Bay Area and Central Coast. The deterministic NBM appears to
be a realistic starting point for the forecast. However, there are
some cooler and hotter solutions that reside in some of the
forecasts. The cooler solutions, as we`ve seen this past summer,
advertise more persistent troughing which will keep the Four
Corners high anchored over the Pacific Southwest. Again, that has
been the theme for this year and these larger scale patterns often
require some dramatic feature to shift things. Not seeing
anything in the guidance that would suggest that yet. It should be
noted, that our cooler than normal summer may result in a slight
cool bias in the deterministic NBM. The warmer solutions weaken
the aforementioned troughing such that low/mid level flow
diminishes, effectively limiting the amount of inland intrusion of
the marine layer. Should the troughing be less diffuse and/or the
Four Corners high move farther to the west, then temperatures
(mainly across the interior) could approach or exceed 100F. With
the Central Valley likely to heat up, this should drive diurnal
wind patterns that will keep the coastal regions very temperate
thanks to the marine stratus. If the warmer conditions do verify,
then we`ll examine an increased potential for grass fires as
fuels become cured and available. Fortunately, it doesn`t appear
that we have any significant wind potential (outside of the gaps,
passes, channels) with this synoptic scale pattern.

One last thing to mention and that`s eastern Pacific tropical
activity. Climatologically, these have been an important player
for some of our fires induced by lightning events in August. At
this time, the train of tropical cyclones appears that it`ll
remain far south enough such that there will be little to no
influence. We`ll need to watch the position of the coastal trough,
Four Corners high and subsequent mid/upper level moisture feeds.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 450 AM PDT Sun Aug 3 2025

Challenging forecast this morning as some drier air has worked in
eroding/slowing some of the stratus deck. That being said, based
on the drier air, satellite trends, and latest obs removed or
delayed impact of stratus for a few terminals around the Bay Area,
specifically in SF Bay and N Bay Valleys. The coast, MRY Bay, and
Salinas Valley on the other hand are being impacted with low cigs.
These cigs will linger well into the afternoon hours. Low clouds
sneaking northward in Santa Clara Valley could impact SJC so a
tempo has been introduced.

Vicinity of SFO...Low cigs in the Gap knocked all night, but not a
whole lot of movement of cigs. There`s been a slight expansion of
cigs NW of the terminal since 11Z. As such, included a tempo for
intrusion this morning, but confidence is low. Winds do ramp up
this afternoon with gusts over 30 kts. Held off on AWW at this
time, but there is a 20% chance for 35 kt winds at SFO.

SFO Bridge Approach...Clear.

Monterey Bay Terminals...Socked in with IFR cigs. Cigs will last
into the afternoon with increasing winds. A few hours of VFR
possible late before cigs return this evening.

.MARINE...
(Today through Friday)
Issued at 934 AM PDT Sun Aug 3 2025

Northwesterly winds will increase over the waters today. Winds
will be locally stronger along the coast north of Point Reyes and
south of Point Sur with gale force gusts. Expect hazardous
conditions for small craft in the bays during the afternoon and
evening hours, especially today and Monday. Seas will remain
moderate to rough through the middle of next week.

.MTR WATCHES/WARNINGS/ADVISORIES...

PZ...Small Craft Advisory from 3 PM this afternoon to 3 AM PDT Monday
     for SF Bay N of Bay Bridge.

     Small Craft Advisory until 3 AM PDT Monday for Mry Bay-Pigeon Pt
     to Pt Pinos 0-10 nm.

     Small Craft Advisory until 3 PM PDT this afternoon for Pt Arena
     to Pt Reyes 0-10 nm.

     Gale Warning from 3 PM this afternoon to 3 AM PDT Monday for Pt
     Arena to Pt Reyes 0-10 nm.

     Small Craft Advisory until 3 PM PDT Monday for Pigeon Pt to Pt
     Pinos 10-60 NM-Pt Arena to Pt Reyes 10-60 NM-Pt Reyes to
     Pigeon Pt 0-10 nm.

     Gale Warning until 3 PM PDT Monday for Pt Pinos to Pt Piedras
     Blancas 0-10 nm.
