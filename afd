.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 340 AM PDT Wed Jun 7 2023

Though isolated showers persist in NorCal and the Central Valley,
they have diminished for the SF and Monterey Bay regions. The
upper low that brought this shower activity will linger over CA
for the rest of the week. The main impact is that daytime highs
will remain a few degrees to 10 to 15 degrees below normal in the
seven day forecast. Gradual warming will occur over the weekend
into early next week bringing temperatures closer to normal.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 340 AM PDT Wed Jun 7 2023

Have been watching radar all night as the upper level low
continues to spin counter-clockwise centered over SoCal. On water
vapor satellite imagery, the center of the low appears to be over
Kern County and though moisture has been wrapping around the low
and moving showers into Central CA and NorCal, they have generally
stayed just north or just to the southeast of our CWA. If we were
to get any additional showers during the early morning hours, it
would be in the far NW corner of Sonoma county or the far
southeast corner of Monterey county. Otherwise, the hi-res models
(NAM, HRRR, HREF) are suggesting that our forecast area should be
done with showers. However, they do all indicate that areas to our
east, especially across the Sierra, will likely stay active again
this afternoon.

With that low lingering, we remain in a southerly wind regime.
This morning`s winds are fairly light and are expected to get a
little breezy this afternoon with gusts getting between 15-25 mph
in the afternoon and up until around 8 pm PST.

Afternoon temperatures today will be about 5 to 15 degrees below
normal with inland areas warming into the mid 60s to mid 70s and
coastal areas in the upper 50s to mid 60s.

.LONG TERM...
(Thursday through Tuesday)
Issued at 340 AM PDT Wed Jun 7 2023

The upper low will continue to gradually track east to
northeastward. As it does so, it will weaken and open up into a
more trough pattern. Long range models are showing that our CWA
could have a touch of weak ridging on Friday as that low moves NE.
This will allow daytime highs to gradually warm this weekend.
Though it should be noted that, despite that warmer trend, the
daytime highs will still be slightly below normal for the month of
June.

In case you were curious, here are June climate normals for mean
Max Temps with some of our official climate sites (degrees F):

Santa Rosa: 80
Napa: 82
Livermore: 84
Downtown SF: 67
Oakland: 72
San Jose: 80
Gilroy: 83
Salinas: 70
King City: 83

Ensemble models still show a chance of light precipitation
starting either this weekend or early next week. However, they are
trending lighter so if this does occur, any rain amounts would
likely only be a few hundredths (less than 0.10" total).

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 446 AM PDT Wed Jun 7 2023

Overall MVFR conditions prevail across the region with upper level
low continuing to spin over the San Joaquin Valley. However, there
are some isolated spots where dry air is entraining, resulting in
localized VFR conditions (ie SF Bay terminals). VFR will prevail
by late morning/early afternoon. SW/WSW winds increase early
afternoon and will eventually turn more westerly for NW oriented
valleys. Low to moderate confidence on return of MVFR cigs tonight
into Thurs morning as upper low weakens and lifts into the Great
Basin and a new trough starts to move in. However due to
persistence of marine layer, can expect some MVFR conditions Thurs
morning, just timing of arrival and coverage is still uncertain.

Vicinity of SFO...VFR currently with SCT low clouds at 3000-3300
feet. However, models indicating a potential surge in low clouds
resulting in MVFR conditions between 13 and 17z, so TEMPO group
included for this possibility. Confidence of occurrence is
moderate however and will remove TEMPO if needed. VFR will
prevail late this morning through the evening today. Low
confidence of MVFR cigs tonight into Thurs morning, so VFR
conditions in SFO taf for now prevailing after 17z today. Winds
will be out of the WSW becoming breezy this afternoon.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...MVFR to potential IFR as the morning
progresses at KMRY. Models hinting at clearing to VFR this
afternoon, which makes sense as upper low moves off and dry air
moves in. Also looking at a slightly later arrival of MVFR cigs
to around 05-06z, although some guidance pushes arrival back to
09z, so will have to continue to monitor as confidence of timing
increases. WSW winds with gusts up to 15 knots expected for KMRY
and breezy NW winds expected for KSNS this afternoon/evening.

.MARINE...
(Today through Monday)
Issued at 305 AM PDT Wed Jun 7 2023

Southerly wind persists over the coastal waters becoming locally
breezy during afternoon and evening hours. Winds shift to the
northwest on Friday and build through the weekend. Mixed seas
continue through the week with swells from the northwest at 9 to
12 seconds and the south at 16 to 18 seconds.

.MTR WATCHES/WARNINGS/ADVISORIES...
