.SHORT TERM...
Issued at 102 AM PDT Sun Oct 26 2025
(Today and tonight)

The next band of rain is just north of Sonoma County, but it`s not
moving south. A baroclinic leaf off the coast of northern
California indicates a new surface low pressure system is forming.
This cyclogenesis is supported by divergence aloft in the right
rear quadrant of a 160 kt jet streak. The associated wind field
will cause the boundary to transition to a warm front, and there
are some indications that is already happening. The temperature
has increased at Ukiah over the last hour, despite the fact that
it`s the middle of the night. This complicates the forecast as the
warm front wants to move north while the parent low moves east.
The low will make landfall in the late afternoon, dragging the
final cold front across the Bay Area. Some strong wind and light
rain will move through in the prefrontal region, with the impacts
focused mainly in the North Bay. Frontal passage will be followed
by quickly clearing skies through the evening.

.LONG TERM...
Issued at 102 AM PDT Sun Oct 26 2025
(Monday through Saturday)

Really nice weather this week! The marine layer will remain
disrupted by the fropa on Sunday, and Monday will start with
mostly clear skies and chilly temperatures. The 850 mb temperature
will quickly climb from 7C to around 17C by Tuesday as a ridge
builds aloft. This will allow temperatures to climb into the upper
70s and low 80s inland. Weak offshore winds will help bring some
of this heat all the way to the coast, where it should be
fantastic weather Tuesday - Wednesday. Coastal temperatures will
be in the upper 60s to low 70s, with no clouds, and a light
breeze. A shallow trough will move through the Pacific Northwest
Wednesday, flattening the ridge. This won`t have a drastic effect
on our weather, other than deepening the marine layer and bringing
some clouds back to the region. Ridging will continue into the
weekend with warm, dry weather prevailing. Halloween looks great
with comfortable temperatures and no real chance for rain.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 516 AM PDT Sun Oct 26 2025

Light winds and mid to high level clouds are affecting the region.
Spotty lowers CIGs and areas of fog are affecting the coast, the
Monterey Bay and portions of the more interior valleys. A front is
approaching from the north, bringing light showers and MVFR CIGs.
This front will slowly move south through the day, with increasing
southerly winds along the edge of the front. Showers will be the
most organized in the North Bay and around the SF Bay, but showers
scatter as they head farther south. Winds turn westerly in the wake
of the front as CIGs scatter. Cloud cover erodes in the post frontal
environment.

Vicinity of SFO...VFR and light winds last through the morning. Mid-
level and high clouds are building into the area ahead of the front.
Expect winds to become breezy and turn more southwest into the
afternoon as the front arrives. Light showers with slight reductions
in visibilities are expected as the front passes over the terminal.
Winds turn westerly as the front and it`s showers and cloud cover
exit. Winds reduce into the night and look to turn northerly into
early Monday.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...LIFR CIGs and pockets of fog linger into
the mid morning before CIGs rise slightly and fog scatters. Expect
VFR into the afternoons with winds increasing slightly. Shower
activity arrives in the evening along the front, but showers will be
spotty. The front and rain chances exit into the night with cloud
cover clearing in the front`s wake.

.MARINE...
(Today through Friday)
Issued at 516 AM PDT Sun Oct 26 2025

Light winds last through the night but winds build into Sunday
morning, becoming breezy and gusty through the work week. Rough
seas linger for the outer waters through the day, but seas will
slowly start to abate Monday. Expect some light rains to move
through the northern waters in the morning and through the
afternoon, but exit into the evening.

&&

.BEACHES...
Issued at 702 PM PDT Sat Oct 25 2025

A moderate to long period northwesterly swell will continue to
bring large breaking waves and an increased risk for sneaker
waves and rip currents through Sunday night. Sneaker waves can
unexpectedly run significantly farther up the beach than normal,
including over rocks and jetties. Rip currents are typically more
frequent and stronger in the vicinity of jetties, inlets, and
piers. Swimmers should always swim near a lifeguard. Remain out of
the water to avoid hazardous swimming conditions and never turn
your back on the ocean!
