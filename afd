.SHORT TERM...
Issued at 1225 AM PDT Mon Oct 27 2025
(Today and tonight)

The radar has been put back in clear air mode as the rain has
ended across the cwa. Some patchy low clouds persist over the Bay
Area, but they should clear by mid day as much drier air filters
in. The SFO-WMC gradient was +6.7 mb at 26/06Z, and has dropped
to +2.3 by 27/06Z. This gradient will flip negative and continue
to drop through the day, eventually reaching -5 mb or so as high
pressure builds over the northern Rockies, and a surface trough
forms over California. This gradient will trigger some dry,
offshore, N-NE winds that will persist for several days. The 850mb
temperature is quickly rising, but is still below normal and the
lingering clouds will keep temperatures mild today.

.LONG TERM...
Issued at 1225 AM PDT Mon Oct 27 2025
(Tuesday through Sunday)

Classic La Nina pattern this week with a few weak troughs moving
across the Pacific Northwest, while a strong ridge persists over
Southern California. The Bay Area will be influenced more by the
ridging, but it won`t be quite as hot as southern California. The
warming and drying trend will continue into Tuesday with clear
skies and continued offshore wind. Inland temperatures will climb
into the upper 70s with the minimum RH dropping to 25-35%. The
offshore wind will help push the warmer air all the way to the
coast, where the temperature should climb to upper 60s to low
70s. The actual wind speed doesn`t look very strong, helping keep
fire weather concerns in check. Wednesday will be a few degrees
warmer and currently looks like the warmest day of the week. Since
temperatures are as much as 10-15 degrees higher than normal, we
have some minor HeatRisk mid week. The offshore wind will likely
ease or flip back onshore by Thursday, which could bring us some
cloud cover, but still no chance of rain. Most ensemble members
suggest ridging will continue until the middle of next week.
