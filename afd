.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 253 AM PDT Wed Jul 12 2023

Near seasonal normal highs through Thursday. Much warmer Friday
and through the weekend with potentially major heat impacts. Cool
down slated for Monday.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 253 AM PDT Wed Jul 12 2023

Zonal flow will slowly turn to ridging today, continuing the
warming pattern Expect a warmer day today with afternoon highs
generally in the 80s and 90s inland, 60s to lower 70s coast. A
few of the interior regions will approach triple-digit heat.
Lows tonight will also begin their warming trend, but those
temperature increase will be modest. The marine layer continues to
compress tonight, keeping low clouds and fog along the coast and
within the deeper valleys.

&&

.LONG TERM...
(Thursday through Tuesday)
Issued at 253 AM PDT Wed Jul 12 2023

The ridging pattern becomes more pronounced on Thursday, but the
effects will not be as notable along the coast. The inland areas
will see highs jump up a few degrees, allowing more locations of
triple-digit heat.

Friday brings more widespread warming along with reduced overnight
cooling as lows build into the 60s and 70s for all but the
immediate coast.

This leads into a weekend that can be hazardous to your health if
you are not prepared. Not only will there be triple digit heat
for the inland areas but overnight relief from the heat could be
stunted as lows only fall into the 60s and 70s in the areas of
most concern. Making this heat event feel more like a marathon
than a few sprints of hot temperatures. While coastal areas look
to be spared from the warmest of the warm, you won`t have to go
far inland to see notably warmer temperatures.

Be smart and plan ahead for the heat, and have a back-up plan as
well. Heading to the coast to escape the heat can help, but
remember that several others will have the same idea.

Key Messages for Heat remain:

- stay hydrated and cool (use public AC if needed: malls,
  libraries, movie theaters, etc)
- avoid outdoor activities between 1 to 6 pm (hotter part of the
  day) including walking your pets
- monitor the elderly, young, sick, pets, and livestock for heat
  sensitivity
- double check your vehicles making sure no people or pets are
  left inside while parked in the sun

Keep up to date on weather information this week to get the latest
on these hazards. Be safe, friends.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 421 AM PDT Wed Jul 12 2023

Satellite shows stratus has moved over most terminals near the
coast and is pretty socked in. Therefore, a mix of VFR, IFR, and
LIFR throughout the region. The marine layer sits about 1500 near
Fort Ord and about 1000 feet near Bodega Bay creating some ceilings
that are a bit higher than yesterday. Expect clearing for all
terminals near 16-17Z as diurnal heating takes into effect. A
northwesterly pattern will bring winds up to 12-15 knots with SF
bay possibly becoming gusty in the afternoon/early evening. Expect
stratus to return tonight for mostly North Bay and Monterey Bay
terminals. Some patchy fog is expected along the coast, therefore
North Bay and Monterey is expected to experience some visibility
issues late tonight into tomorrow morning. Low confidence that
KAPC may go IFR but some models did suggest low ceilings late
tonight. Moderate confidence that KOAK may experience IFR ceilings
as some models suggest FEW or SCT clouds through the TAF period.
Winds are expected to return to light to moderate overnight.

Vicinity of SFO...Expect VFR conditions through the TAF period. Some
models suggested MVFR ceilings tomorrow morning but had low
confidence to include in TAFs, but will monitor if any changes is
needed. Onshore winds are expected to become breezy and gusty near
the morning and early afternoon and is expected to transition to
moderate near midnight.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...LIFR but visibility issues are starting
to improve. Some uncertainty for KMRY on clearing time and if LIFR
conditions will prevail through the TAF period as models lack
agreement. As of now, expect clearing near 17Z for KSNS and 20Z
for KMRY with a return of stratus near 3Z for both terminals.
Onshore winds are expected become breezier in the morning through
the Salinas Valley, as KMRY will experience moderate to light
winds through the TAF period.

.MARINE...
(Tonight through next Sunday)
Issued at 235 AM PDT Wed Jul 12 2023

Northwesterly winds continue over the northern waters with breezy
to gusty conditions through the weekend, slowly extending south
over the outer waters. The SF Bay and Delta will generally see
breezy to gusty conditions increasing into the afternoons before
winds diminish into the night. These stronger winds will result
in steep wind waves and hazardous conditions to small craft. Mixed
seas of light northerly and moderate period (8-10 seconds) swell,
and light southerly swell continue through the weekend.
