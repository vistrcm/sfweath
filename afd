...New AVIATION, MARINE...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 1222 AM PDT Fri Sep 15 2023

A gradual cooling trend will begin today for inland areas and
persist into early next week. Low clouds and fog will linger along
the immediate coast, helping to moderate temperatures there.
Coastal drizzle is possible during the late night and early
morning hours.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 1222 AM PDT Fri Sep 15 2023

Stratus is expanding inland throughout the region and will impact
all but the highest mountain ranges and the most interior of inland
valley locations. Most of the region should clear out through the
morning hours, but the coastal areas should expect to be socked in
throughout the day. A deep marine layer around 1500-2000 feet will
once again allow for a chance of drizzle at the coastal locations
through the morning.

An upper level ridge over the Pacific Northwest starts migrating
inland today, allowing a cutoff low currently located around 600
miles west-southwest of San Francisco to approach the state. This
will cause a slight cooling trend to begin today. High temperatures
in the interior valleys will see temperatures in the mid to upper
80s, with the most interior locations seeing temperatures in the low
90s. Along the Bayshore, temperatures will rise to the low to mid
70s, while the Pacific coast will see temperatures in the 60s.
Breezy onshore flow will once again set up this afternoon, with
gusts up to 20 miles per hour through the passes and gaps.

&&

.LONG TERM...
(Saturday through Thursday)
Issued at 1222 AM PDT Fri Sep 15 2023

The upper pattern will initially feature low pressure meandering off
the CA coast with high pressure over the Four Corners region. Mean
troughing should evolve across the west by mid week with the
aforementioned low moving inland and devolving to an open-wave
trough. By late week an expansive closed circulation drops into the
Great Basin with high pressure locating across northern Mexico. The
surface pattern should generally feature high pressure over the
eastern Pacific with thermal troughing through the Central Valley.
This will maintain an onshore (moist) wind regime with breezy
conditions along the coast, through the delta, and within the gaps
and passes each afternoon. Despite the large-scale changes our local
weather should be pretty status-quo with coastal clouds, cool
temperatures, and a relatively deep marine layer all present. So
outside of subtle day-to-day variations it looks like our weather
will be on repeat for the near future.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 426 AM PDT Fri Sep 15 2023

Extensive stratus coverage, generally MVFR-IFR, throughout the
region and at all main terminals. Stratus will dissipate through the
morning with the coastal areas remaining under MVFR ceilings at best
through the TAF period. Breezy onshore flow will develop in the
afternoon with wind speeds up to 10-15 knots. Stratus will build
back this evening with coverage similar to the present situation.

Vicinity of SFO... MVFR-IFR stratus expected through around 17-18Z
when the clouds mix out. Afternoon winds from the west-northwest,
with gusts up to 15-20 knots. Winds start to diminish in the
evening, with stratus developing again after midnight.

SFO Bridge Approach... Stratus this evening will impact the approach
path before the terminal reports a ceiling. Otherwise similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals... IFR conditions continue into the morning
at SNS. High confidence that the coastal region, including MRY,
remains under an MVFR-IFR ceiling through the end of the TAF period.
Breezy northwesterly winds this afternoon, speeds of up to 12 knots.
Stratus returns to SNS this evening as winds diminish.

&&

.MARINE...
(Today through Wednesday)
Issued at 426 AM PDT Fri Sep 15 2023

Wind speeds continue to be between light breeze and gentle breeze
status. A moderate northwest swell is interacting with a light
southerly swell to generate 3-5 ft significant wave heights in the
coastal waters and 5-7 ft in the offshore zones. Winds become
gusty over the San Francisco Bay and the Delta this afternoon
with gusts between 20 and 30 knots. Sea heights are on an abating
trend through the weekend. After a quiet weekend, winds will begin
to increase in the northern zones by early to mid-week.
