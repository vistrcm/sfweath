.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 222 AM PST Sun Jan 21 2024

Moderate to heavy rainfall begins late Sunday night and lasts into
early Monday morning. Chances of isolated thunderstorms Monday
morning. A wind advisory has been issued for late Sunday night
through early Monday morning for gusty and strong southerly winds
associated with the approaching front. Light rain again midweek,
then drier and warmer weather in the late week.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 222 AM PST Sun Jan 21 2024

At this hour, widespread but
predominantly light rain continues to fall across much of the
region. Rain will continue through much of the night, but will
slowly become more scattered into Sunday morning.

Into Sunday afternoon and evening, more widespread rain returns, and
is expected to produce the greatest amount of rainfall out of the
systems seen throughout the weekend thus far. Rainfall will be
moderate to heavy at times, with the heaviest rain falling in the
early morning of Monday, prior to sunrise. Rain rates could reach up
to 0.25"/hr generally for lower elevations, with isolated mountain
peaks and higher elevations (particularly in the Santa Lucia
mountains) seeing rain rates of greater than 0.5"/hr. PWATs for
early Monday morning are about 1.1", exceeding the 90th percentile
climatology for KOAK sounding at that time. In addition, Mon 12Z WPC
surface chart analysis indicates a triple point just off of the Big
Sur coast. But what does this mean? A frontal triple point is the
intersection of a warm, cold, and occluded front, and can lead to
enhanced lift. Combine this with the higher PWATs, aka very moist
air, and you have the chance for some potentially heavy rainfall
(Worth mentioning- WPC days 1 and 2 places the CWA under a MRGL ERO,
with the North Bay falling under a "Slight" ERO on day 1.). But
thats not all; enhanced wind shear can also be found near the triple
point which is an ingredient for thunderstorm development. That
being said, SPC day 2 convective outlook has much of the coastal CWA
south of Napa and Sonoma counties in a general mention for increased
chances of thunderstorms. The greatest chances of thunderstorms
continues to be early Monday morning.

Aside from heavier rain and the chance for isolated thunderstorms,
gusty southerly winds will be present Monday morning. NAM 3km 925mb
analysis Monday morning shows a jet setting up off the coastline.
Gusts up to 45 to 50 mph are possible at ridgetops and higher
elevations, with gusts up to 30mph in lower elevations. A wind
advisory has been issued for the immediate coastline and coastal
mountains between 10pm Sunday and 4am Monday as a result.

This all said, what are we looking at for rainfall totals after all
is said and done Monday? The coastal mountains will receive
somewhere between 2-3" of rain, North Bay about 1.25" of rain,
greater SF bay area about 0.75"-1" of rain, and about 0.75-1" for
the Monterey region and Salinas Valley.

.LONG TERM...
(Monday through Saturday)
Issued at 222 AM PST Sun Jan 21 2024

Beyond Monday, a brief break in the rain is expected
Tuesday. Though, come early Wednesday, and conditions get a bit
soggy once more. Though, Wednesdays rain thus far appears to be
light, with the North Bay only receiving about 0.5-0.75" at most,
greater SF bay area up to 0.5", and generally a quarter inch or less
for the Santa Clara Valley, Salinas Valley, and Monterey region.
Come late Thursday, much of the rain will have dissipated, and
ridging will develop. This ridging will lead to dry conditions
and potentially even some warmer temperatures into the high 60s
and low 70s come the end of the week for interior locations. CPC
6-10 and 8- 14 day outlook places the CWA under an 80-90% chance
of above normal temperatures. Stay tuned for some warmer and drier
weather on the horizon!

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 345 AM PST Sun Jan 21 2024

VFR-MVFR into late afternoon with periodic showers. Southerly
winds will become increasingly gusty. A warm front will bring
moderate to occasionally heavy rain overnight into Monday morning
with strong gusty winds and lowering ceilings and visibilities.
Conditions improve mid to late Monday morning with showers ending.

Vicinity of SFO...VFR-MVFR into this afternoon with VCSH and increasing
southerly winds. Winds approach airport weather warning criteria
(sustained and/or gusts 35 knots or greater) by late afternoon.
Moderate to occasionally heavy rain accompanies a warm front
tonight into Monday morning with strong gusty winds gradually
easing after daybreak.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...VFR into this afternoon with VCSH and
increasing S-SE winds. Gusts in the Salinas Valley may reach or
exceed 30 kt later today into tonight. Moderate to occasionally
heavy rain accompanies a warm front tonight into Monday morning
with winds easing towards midday.

.MARINE...
(Today through Friday)
Issued at 345 AM PST Sun Jan 21 2024

Rain continues through Monday morning, with isolated thunderstorms
possible over the coastal waters Monday morning as well. Strong
and gusty winds out of the south beginning late Sunday and
lasting into early Monday will create steep wind waves and
hazardous conditions for small craft. Winds begin to ease Monday
afternoon, turning to become more W/NW and moderate. Light rain
returns midweek. Moderate period W/NW swell continues to move
through the waters through the mid week.

.HYDROLOGY...
Issued at 225 AM PST Sun Jan 21 2024

A Flood Watch is in effect for the North Bay Sunday evening
through Monday evening. Moderate to heavy rainfall may bring rapid
rises in more responsive creeks and streams in the North Bay such
as Green Valley and Mark West. Both creeks are forecast to reach
action stage, with Green Valley briefly reaching minor flooding
stage. At this time, no major flooding impacts are expected.
However, with already saturated soils, minor nuisance flooding of
roadways and creeks are likely.

WPC continues to feature the North Bay in a "slight" risk (15%)
of excessive rainfall in the Day 1 ERO. The remainder of the CWA
maintains a MRGL ERO for WPC Days 1 and 2.

USGS instrumentation throughout the San Francisco Bay Area indicates
that shallow soils on steep hillsides are approaching saturation.
With more rain incoming to further saturate soils, shallow
landslides across the CWA remain a possibility.
