...New UPDATE...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 1207 AM PDT Sat Mar 23 2024

Unsettled weather continues today into Sunday morning with breezy
winds, rain showers, and even a few thunderstorms. A bit drier for
Monday into Tuesday before rain chances return for mid week into
next weekend.

.UPDATE...
Issued at 840 AM PDT Sat Mar 23 2024

Active start to the day and KMUX radar is definitely spinning in
precip mode. The cold front that brought precip to the region on
Friday is now in SoCal. In its wake a weak surface trough is
currently moving through. The surface trough coupled with a cold upper
level trough is yielding widely scattered showers across the Bay
Area and Central Coast this morning. Given the scattered nature of
shower activity this morning rainfall amounts over the last six
hours range from a trace/nothing to 0.35 inches. Taking a look at
the KOAK sounding and the last NUCAPs sounding reveal weak
instability is also present. One stronger cell had enough vertical
development with vertically integrated ice to produce a lightning
strike. A flash was observed on GLM lightning feed near Half Moon
Bay earlier this morning.

Given post-frontal regime from yesterday the snow levels have
dropped below 5k feet. Profilers and observations put the snow
level around 4000-4500 feet. Therefore, some of the highest peaks
(Gabilan/Santa Lucia) will see a mix of snow/rain. Not expecting
much in the way of accumulation - a few inches at best.

No update is needed this morning as current forecast mentions
showers and thunderstorms.

Safety message for the rest of the day- Thunder roars, go indoors.
Or see a flash, dash inside. Storm Prediction Center still
mentions general thunderstorm risk for the region today.
Thunderstorm chances will increase through the day with daytime
heating. Be weather aware if you have outdoor plans.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today through Sunday)
Issued at 1207 AM PDT Sat Mar 23 2024

A vertically stacked low pressure system will drop southeast towards
the CA/OR border by this evening as the associated surface low
gradually fills. After a brief lull in precipitation for the Bay
Area early this morning expect an uptick in activity during the late
morning/early afternoon hours as a surface trough approaches
northern and central California from the west. Instability will be
on the increase during this time as mid-level lapse rates exceed
minus 7 degrees/km as colder air arrives aloft. Mixed layer CAPE
(convective available potential energy -- a value approximating the
robustness of a thunderstorm updraft should one develop) still
appears to peak around 200-300 J/kg this afternoon with only modest
largely unidirectional shear. This environment appears supportive of
isolated to perhaps scattered thunderstorms with lightning, locally
heavy rainfall, small hail, and gusty winds as the primary hazards.
Rain amounts will vary widely given the convective nature of showers
and storms with some folks seeing nothing while localized spots
under a heavy shower or storm could pick up a quick 1" or so. While
the large-scale environment appears unsupportive of widespread
flooding concerns, can`t rule out localized issues if a heavy shower
or storm overstays its welcome in an urban and/or hydrologically
sensitive area. Scattered showers and isolated thunderstorms are
likely to persist (with a bit less coverage) overnight into Sunday
morning, with the greatest potential shifting south towards the
Central Coast by early Sunday afternoon. Temperatures will be on the
cool side given increased cloud cover and onshore flow with highs
mostly in the 50s to around 60. Lows tonight will be mostly in the
40s.

.LONG TERM...
(Monday through Friday)
Issued at 1207 AM PDT Sat Mar 23 2024

Generally quiet through the first portion of the week although a
weak weather system may bring small rain chances to the Bay Area
(generally north of the Golden Gate) on Monday.

Otherwise wet weather returns to the region on Wednesday into
Thursday as a weak cold front passes through the region. Rain
amounts at this point appear to be more beneficial than overly
impactful.

Another system with a better moisture tap looks to impact the region
on Friday into next weekend with another round of wet weather
anticipated.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 430 AM PDT Sat Mar 23 2024

This TAF period`s main concern hazard/impact wise is the chance
for thunderstorms (30%). The overall trend for this TAF period is
for post-frontal rain showers to continue throughout the entirety
of today with a steadier, more organized push of rain to move
through the area towards the end of the 24-hour TAF period.
Flight categories are expected to remain marginal VFR through the
TAF period; however, brief periods of MVFR or IFR conditions are
possible with stronger showers.

Vicinity of SFO...Currently VFR with breezy southwesterly flow. The
main hazard this TAF period will be the chance (30%) for
thunderstorms mid-morning today into early-morning tomorrow. Post-
frontal rain showers will continue throughout the day with steadier,
more organized rain slated for early tomorrow morning with chances
diminishing towards the end of the TAF period.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...Currently VFR at both terminals. The main
hazard this TAF period will be the chance (30%) for thunderstorms
mid-morning today into mid-morning tomorrow. Post-frontal rain
showers will continue throughout the day with steadier, more
organized rain slated for the end of the TAF period.

.MARINE...
(Today through Thursday)
Issued at 430 AM PDT Sat Mar 23 2024

Increasing thunderstorm chances (30%) along with scattered post-
frontal rain showers will be present over the waters today
through Sunday morning. Fresh westerly breezes will give way to
strong northwesterly breezes by Sunday. Wave heights will build
through the weekend and begin to abate by the beginning of the
work week.
