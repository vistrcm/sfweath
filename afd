.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 413 AM PDT Wed Aug 23 2023

Warm to hot daytime temperatures today, mainly inland, varying 5
to 10 degrees above late August normal high temperatures. Warm to
hot again on Thursday then cooling back to normal for the weekend
and early next week. Fresh northwesterly coastal winds returning
through late week, weekend and early next week.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 423 AM PDT Wed Aug 23 2023

Starting to see signs of restoration to the usual August weather
in our forecast area: the marine layer temperature inversion on
the profilers, nocturnal stratus and fog developing over the
coastal waters, an otherwise clear sky (vs recent widespread tropical
clouds). Half Moon Bay Airport is reporting a 1/4 mile visibility
in fog and 57F. Water vapor per dewpoint temperatures remain
elevated, recently transported here from tropical weather moving
northward. However, with gradual restoration of northwesterly
winds over the coastal waters, here too in our forecast area mid-
latitude air mixing in will gradually lower water vapor a little,
while restoring cold water upwelling and cooling our sea surface
temperatures from currently 59F-65F (approx 5-6F above normal);
it`s common to have a lull in August northwest winds and upwelling.
Since there`s good agreement in the global models that northwesterly
winds over the coastal waters return for a period extending to
the end of August before another lull likely returns, this should
bring about a fresh, noticeable return to our natural coastal air
conditioning.

For today, it will be warm to hot and above normal by 5 to 10
degrees, not too much help from sea-breezes today since sea
surface temps are currently above normal and the marine layer is
compressed. Northwesterly coastal winds need a chance to ramp up,
to get the upwelling going again. Record highs at the long term
sites appear out of reach today compared to today`s forecast highs.
Tonight, temperatures will cool back to the 50s, 60s, with coastal
stratus and fog, clear inland. The marine layer remaining compressed
to several hundred feet deep today and tonight.

.LONG TERM...
(Thursday through Tuesday)
Issued at 423 AM PDT Wed Aug 23 2023

What may appear as meteorologically uninteresting or benign on
the synoptic scale specifically upstream from our forecast area,
yet again from an ongoing active synoptic to northern hemispheric
scale long wave trough pattern for a summer season, is a blend of
mid-latitude and sub-tropical jet stream strength in winds carving
out (another) 500 mb low to our northwest and west, including this
time coupled to lowering surface pressures with the 500 mb low. Out
ahead of this low the eastern Pacific surface high pressure system
will evolve into a surface ridge steepening the surface pressure
gradient and consequently our coastal northwesterly winds. This will
help bring about onshore winds, a period of cold water upwelling
(through the end of August), ushering in cooler sea-breezes inland
later this week, weekend and early next week, limiting heat risks
to minor to moderate inland.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 426 AM PDT Wed Aug 23 2023

Extensive IFR-LIFR stratus at the immediate coast, but inland
development has been rather limited partially owing to weak SFO-SAC
gradients, and confidence in development inland is decreasing with
every hour that terminals remain clear. Whatever stratus does
develop inland will burn off by around 16-18Z, as winds build from a
westerly onshore pattern with the terminals coming up to 10-15
knots. Winds diminish in the evening hours with low confidence for
any inland development of stratus through Thursday morning.

Vicinity of SFO... No changes to the forecast thinking; the previous
discussion follows. -- VFR with a low confidence (20-30%
probability) of IFR stratus at the terminal. Chances for stratus
clear out in the late morning with west-northwest winds gusting to
15-20 knots in the afternoon. Winds diminishing in the evening with
a low confidence for stratus development into Thursday morning.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...Stratus has generally remained offshore and
out of Monterey Bay. Confidence is decreasing for any stratus
impacts to the terminals, although if stratus does form, a
compressed marine layer keeps ceilings in LIFR criteria. Whatever
stratus forms on land dissipates around 16-18Z. West to northwest
winds develop this afternoon with speeds up to 10-15 knots,
diminishing in the afternoon with a low confidence for stratus
development this evening into Thursday morning, slightly higher at
MRY.

.MARINE...
(Today through Monday)
Issued at 250 AM PDT Wed Aug 23 2023

Northwest winds remain light to moderate into the weekend with
some breezy conditions during the afternoons near favored coastal
jets mostly south of Pigeon Point and through the San Francisco
Bay. Widespread breezy winds build during the weekend, bringing
steeper wind waves to the coastal waters. A mix of northwesterly
and southerly swells persists through the week.
