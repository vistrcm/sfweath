.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 424 AM PST Tue Jan 30 2024

Another unseasonably warm day ahead with highs ranging from the
upper 50s and low 60s along the coast to the low 70s in the Santa
Clara and Salinas Valleys. Perfect time to clear out the gutters,
tie down the outdoor furniture and trash cans, check the batteries in
the weather radio, and make sure your go-bag is nicely stocked.
Today will be the last day of our pleasant stretch of weather,
because the next rain system arrives late tonight and into
Wednesday morning.

Winds turn south ahead of the rain band and become breezy this
evening. Gusts build into the night with dangerously strong winds
expected early Wednesday morning that will spread across the CWA
through the day.

.LONG TERM...
(Wednesday through Monday)
Issued at 424 AM PST Tue Jan 30 2024

Wednesday is the main event. The overnight forecast package made
slight adjustments to time of arrival and rainfall totals, with
the model trend showing a delayed start of the rain, but a
thinning of the main rain band, and a slightly quicker passage.
Rainfall amounts have been slightly reduced with these updates,
but flooding risks and overall rain impacts stay similar. The
overnight forecast team noted recent short-term model and ensemble
outputs and upped the peak wind forecast. As such, the Wind
Advisory has been expended across the CWA with a High Wind Warning
issued for the Santa Cruz and Santa Lucia mountain ranges.
Wednesday is looking as much of a wind event as it is a rain
event.

As of the most recent forecast update, the highest rain rates fall
in the North Bay Wednesday afternoon then the band spreads farther
south and east into the evening and late night. Rain rates reduce
into early Thursday but light showers and slight chances for storms
linger through that day.

Updated rainfall totals for Wednesday through Thursday:

1" to 2": Santa Clara Valley, Interior East Bay, interior Monterey
Co, San Benito Co

2" to 3": San Francisco, San Mateo Coast, Oakland, East Bay Hills,
San Mateo Co, lower elevations of Santa Cruz Co, southern portions
of the North Bay, Big Sur Coast

3 to 5": Santa Cruz Mtns, Northern and Coastal North Bay.

Above 5": The highest peaks of coastal Mtns

As per previous discussions, the main rainfall threat will urban and
small stream flooding as will as shallow mud/rock slides. Main
rivers will see increases during the event, but with rainfall
from smaller streams and higher slopes will tribute into them, the
threat of river flooding lasts beyond the rain system`s passage.

Friday and Saturday see the potential for more showers activity, but
do not look to be impactful. Longer term models are starting to
agree on another rain event arriving Sunday into early next week,
but model trends may continue to push it farther south.
