...New AVIATION...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 357 AM PDT Fri Aug 16 2024

Seasonal to slightly cooler than normal temperatures will continue
through the weekend into next week. Increased coverage of early
morning marine layer stratus, fog and drizzle is likely this
weekend.

&&

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 357 AM PDT Fri Aug 16 2024

Low level marine stratus has been slow to develop overnight but has
begun to develop along the coast line of the South Bay area and the
Monterey Peninsula into the Salinas Valley as of 330am this morning.
Coastal clouds are expected to mostly clear by late morning into
early afternoon with temperatures increasing slightly from
yesterday, the result of weak shortwave ridging overhead this
morning and afternoon. A deepening upper low over the Pacific
Northwest will usher in a cooler airmass later tonight and persist
through the weekend. Sharp H50 height falls associated with the
upper low will result in deeper marine layer moisture and H85
temperatures to drop from around 20c today to 15c by Saturday
morning. The decreasing temperatures aloft, steady onshore flow and
increased moisture will allow for more widespread low level marine
stratus tonight into tomorrow morning than we`ve seen the last few
nights with increased coverage of fog and drizzle likely as well.

.LONG TERM...
(Saturday through Thursday)
Issued at 357 AM PDT Fri Aug 16 2024

A strong, amplified ridge will emerge over central CONUS this
weekend and persist through next week. The developing (Omega)
blocking pattern will keep us under the influence of the
deepening upper low to our north over that same time period. As a
result, temperatures will continue to be around or slightly lower
than normal for most locations through the extended forecast. A
slight increase in temperatures can be expected Tuesday or
Wednesday as the upper low lifts north slightly. Another system
quickly dives south and deepens for the end of next week and
beyond as the blocking ridge to the east holds firm, keeping
temperatures relatively mild into the foreseeable future.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 414 AM PDT Fri Aug 16 2024

Patchy IFR-LIFR stratus is present in the Monterey Bay and western
San Mateo peninsula regions. Patchy stratus is expected to continue
across the SF Bay Area, with confidence in a consistent ceiling
decreasing over SFO and OAK. Light winds will prevail this morning.
Stratus will mix out through the morning, with breezy onshore winds
developing in the afternoon and evening.

Vicinity of SFO... VFR at the moment with breezy west-northwest
winds. Moderate confidence that patchy IFR stratus impacts the
terminal before mixing out late this morning. West-northwest winds
will gust to around 28-30 knots this afternoon, before diminishing
in the evening as stratus returns.

SFO Bridge Approach... Lower confidence in stratus impacts.
Otherwise similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals... IFR-LIFR stratus over the terminals this
morning. Stratus should mix out late this morning with breezy
onshore flow in the afternoon and early evening, diminishing as the
stratus returns.

&&

.MARINE...
(Today through Wednesday)
Issued at 357 AM PDT Fri Aug 16 2024

A high pressure center over the offshore waters will weaken while
an early season low pressure system approaches the northern
coastal waters from the northwest during the weekend. Winds will
tend to ease while remaining generally northwesterly through the
weekend and next week.
