...New UPDATE...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 358 AM PDT Tue Aug 6 2024

Heat peaks today with a Heat Advisory in effect for inland areas
of the South Bay and Central Coast. Cooling trend begins Wednesday
into the weekend with normal to slightly below normal temps
expected by the end of the weekend.

&&

.UPDATE...
Issued at 823 AM PDT Tue Aug 6 2024

The forecast remains on track with a Heat Advisory slated to be
in effect from 10 AM to 10 PM for the Santa Clara Valley, Eastern
Santa Clara Hills, Southern Salinas Valley, and interior portions
of Monterey and San Benito Counties. With the exception of a few
coastal and bayside locations, temperatures are generally running
warmer than 24 hours ago as the marine layer compressed overnight
and was not able to protrude as far inland. No anticipated
changes to the forecast at this time.

&&

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 358 AM PDT Tue Aug 6 2024

Upper level ridge peaks today which will bring temps to their
warmest of the week. Evidence of this is already showing early
this morning with the marine layer being compressed to about
400-500 feet, per the Fort Ord profiler. A Heat Advisory is in
effect today from 10 AM to 10 PM for eastern Santa Clara and the
valley, including San Jose, and the interior Central Coast. Not
much change in the forecast temps from the last few days.
Generally mid-to-upper 90s for the interior areas around the Bay,
and ranging from the mid-90s to 110 for the interior Central
Coast. Albeit shallow, the marine layer does hang around today,
keeping areas along the coast in the 60s to lower 70s.

&&

.LONG TERM...
(Wednesday through Monday)
Issued at 358 AM PDT Tue Aug 6 2024

Temperatures will still be warm Wednesday, but will be on the
decline as the ridge weakens and the marine layer gradual deepens.
Perhaps 2-5 degrees cooler depending on how far inland you are.
Far inland locations will see similar temps to today. After
Wednesday, the ridge weakens and migrates eastward with 500 mb
heights falling pretty much consistently through the latter half
of the week. This will result in a gradual cooling trend that
lasts into and through the weekend with at or slightly below
normal high temps expected by the end of the weekend. High
confidence in tropical moisture impacting the area Wednesday into
Thursday from the vibing tropical cyclone party that was just
happening in the EPac west of Mexico. It appears we`ll just see
some cloudiness in the mid-upper levels as the moisture streams
through. There is not much evidence of any elevated instability at
this time.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 434 AM PDT Tue Aug 6 2024

The marine layer has compressed below 1,000 ft and LIFR stratus
is filling in the valleys early this morning. There are some
notable holes at the moment (SFO, SNS), but the satellite trends
suggest they will not last much longer. Dense fog has developed at
STS, with decreasing IFR visibility at MRY. LVK will likely stay
VFR, and SJC is trending in that direction, but could still
develop a ceiling over the next few hours. After a messy morning,
VFR conditions will return by midday.

Vicinity of SFO...Ceilings have developed at both SFO and OAK,
although there are some holes over the Bay. Conditions should be
most challenging between 13Z-17Z before improving. The ceilings
will clear in the late morning with moderate to strong onshore
winds picking up in the afternoon.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...Conditions have deteriorated to LIFR at
MRY, although SNS has remained clear so far and there`s a 40-50%
chance it will dodge a ceiling all morning. MRY, on the other
hand, has a 100 ft ceiling on top of IFR visibility and the clouds
and fog are only getting thicker. Conditions should improve by 17
or 18Z before ceilings return this evening.

&&

.MARINE...
(Today through Sunday)
Issued at 358 AM PDT Tue Aug 6 2024

The gradient between subtropical high pressure over the Eastern
Pacific and lower pressure over the southwest US is supporting a
fresh to strong northwest breeze and moderate to rough seas. The
gradient will relax later in the week before rebuilding by this
weekend.

&&

.MTR WATCHES/WARNINGS/ADVISORIES...
CA...Heat Advisory until 10 PM PDT this evening for CAZ513-514-
     516>518.

PZ...Small Craft Advisory until 3 AM PDT Wednesday for Pigeon Pt to
     Pt Pinos 10-60 NM-Pt Arena to Pt Reyes 10-60 NM.
