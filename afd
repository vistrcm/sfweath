.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 1232 AM PST Thu Feb 20 2025

Outside of some patchy fog this morning, dry weather and clear
skies return today. A warming trend also begins today, with warm
and dry weather through the forecast period.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 1232 AM PST Thu Feb 20 2025

High pressure building behind yesterday`s frontal passage is
trapping some low-level moisture along the coast and in the
valleys. The exceptions is in the North Bay, where weak offshore
winds are keeping the moisture lower, and dew points are in the
low to mid 40s compared to high 40s to low 50s elsewhere across
the Bay Area and Central Coast. Stratus and fog have already
developed in many areas. The Monterey Bay region is actually
reporting some areas of dense fog already. The big question is
whether coverage will increase through the pre-dawn hours.
Typically, this would be a no-brainier. More cooling should
equate to temps dropping to the dew point, saturating the air, and
forcing the formation of cloud/fog droplets. The fly in the
ointment tonight is that the dew points are also trending drier.
After the frontal passage yesterday, a much drier air mass is
moving in. So both the temperature and dew point are dropping, and
the question is which will drop faster. The most likely scenario
is that the winds will stay light and the dry air won`t make it
down to the surface as efficiently as the surface will cool. In
that case, some dense fog advisories may be needed before the
morning commute.

After the sun comes up, any fog will start dissipating and the
skies will be clear this afternoon. At the surface, a 1030 mb
high is building over central Oregon. The gradient between this
feature and the typical inverted trough over the CA coast is
supporting moderate offshore winds, especially at 925 mb. This
will cause the moisture to plummet, and the PWAT will drop from
around 1.0" ahead of the frontal passage yesterday, to 0.3-0.4"
this afternoon. These winds will be gusty at times. Gusts in the
North and East Bay mountains will be up to 30 mph through Thursday
night.

.LONG TERM...
(Friday through Wednesday)
Issued at 1232 AM PST Thu Feb 20 2025

Bottom line, the long term forecast looks nice.

Similar dry conditions will continue Friday, though the gradient
will start to relax and winds ease. The clear skies Thursday night
will cause cool morning temperatures. Frost advisories are not
expected, however, with the possible exception of the southern
Salinas Valley. After the sun comes up, the warming trend begins
in earnest. A warm air mass will move in from the south, with the
1000-500 mb thickness increasing to around 5,580m. Combined with
the clear skies, this will bring inland temps to the upper
60s-low 70s Friday, with mid 60s closer to the coast. Temperatures
will increase a few degrees further over the weekend. The 500 mb
ridge axis will push through late Friday, causing SW flow to bring
in more moisture, especially north of San Jose. The warm
conditions will continue, but there will be more clouds in the sky
Sun-Mon. These high clouds will actually keep the average
temperature higher but limiting nocturnal radiational cooling more
than they block incoming solar radiation. We`ll also start the
days warmer, which will allow higher temps in the afternoon. Dry
air settles back in by Tuesday as a higher amplitude ridge
rebuilds. I`m kind of splitting hairs here looking for clouds.
Overall it`s going to be warm and dry through the middle of next
week. The next interesting feature looks increasingly like it
will be a cut-off low reaching the coast of California late next
week (Thursday- Friday or so) followed by a deep trough. Upper
level cut-off lows are much harder to forecast than the standard
ridge and trough pattern, so the uncertainty is still pretty high.
In highly uncertain situations like this, ensemble analysis is
much more appropriate than simply looking a deterministic model or
two. Ensemble means bring between 1/4-1/2" of rain from Thu-Sun
next week, but there are a few high outliers that are keeping the
mean much higher than the median. The most likely scenario is for
dry weather to continue through the end of next week, but that`s
by no means a guarantee.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 428 AM PST Thu Feb 20 2025

It`s VFR except for a mix of low clouds /MVFR/, patchy fog and
dense fog /IFR-VLIFR/ from the East Bay to the north Central
Coast. Patchy fog and dense fog will mix out under diurnal surface
warming by later morning. VFR tonight and Friday morning except
MVFR-IFR in patchy low clouds and fog may redevelop along the
coastline.

Vicinity of SFO...VFR. Light and variable wind becoming northwest
near 10 knots by late morning or early afternoon. Light west wind
tonight becoming light and variable late at night and Friday
morning.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...IFR-VLIFR in fog and dense fog through
mid to late morning before mixing out under diurnal surface
warming. Currently before sunrise it`s a near ideal combination
for (cool season) fog, i.e. radiative cooling to space, light winds
(vs calm i.e. surface dew formation), gentle near surface cool
air advection, surface dew point temps are near sea surface
temps and it`s possible slightly lowering surface pressures are
also helping. VFR is forecast by late morning, afternoon winds
becoming west to northwest near 10 knots. Slightly more than
moderately confident in VFR forecast for the evening, however low
confidence VFR continues overnight and Friday morning, local
MVFR-IFR in patchy low clouds and fog may redevelop.

.MARINE...
(Today through Tuesday)
Issued at 342 AM PST Thu Feb 20 2025

Surface high pressure over the California offshore waters
extending to Oregon and the Great Basin will weaken through late
week and the weekend. Wet weather will occur over far northern
California and the Pacific Northwest while it`ll remain dry over
our coastal waters and bays through late week and weekend.

&&

.MTR WATCHES/WARNINGS/ADVISORIES...
CA...Dense Fog Advisory until 9 AM PST this morning for CAZ516-528.

     Dense Fog Advisory from 3 AM to 9 AM PST Tuesday for CAZ516-528.

PZ...Dense Fog Advisory until 10 AM PST this morning for Mry Bay.

     Small Craft Advisory until 9 PM PST this evening for Pt Pinos to
     Pt Piedras Blancas 0-10 nm.

     Small Craft Advisory until 3 AM PST Friday for Pigeon Pt to Pt
     Pinos 10-60 NM-Pt Arena to Pt Reyes 10-60 NM.
