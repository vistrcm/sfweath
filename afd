.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 118 AM PST Fri Feb 16 2024

Dry conditions will continue today before an approaching cold
front brings moderate rain and wind through the day Saturday.
Another system will bring heavier rain and wind Sunday evening
through Monday morning. Lighter showers will linger through mid-
week.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 118 AM PST Fri Feb 16 2024

The latest GOES West IR imagery shows high clouds are increasing
in coverage overnight. These clouds are signaling the approaching
cold front, but it will not arrive until Saturday. The big
question for Friday is fog formation in the North Bay. Most of the
ingredients are in place for nocturnal radiation fog to form,
with calm winds and high humidity. The only limiting factor is
the increasing high cloud coverage. This will limit additional
cooling and hinder fog development. Novato and Santa Rosa are both
reporting mist at the moment. Whether this continues to develop
into dense fog is still uncertain. If you`re walking your dog in
the North Bay this morning, expect wet grass at a minimum.
Otherwise Friday will be a pleasant day, with high clouds, a
gentle breeze, and seasonably cool temperatures.

.LONG TERM...
(Saturday through Thursday)
Issued at 118 AM PST Fri Feb 16 2024

The upcoming cold front has slowed a bit, and we are now
expecting the first round of impacts to be confined to Saturday.
Rain and wind will start in the early morning in the North Bay and
push south through the afternoon. Southerly winds are expected to
be moderate (15-20 mph) inland and strong (20-30 mph) near the
coast and at higher elevations. The total accumulation from this
system is around 1-2" in the North Bay and 0.5-1" elsewhere. These
are not overly impressive rain totals, but this first system will
act as a primer, increasing soil moisture and causing the streams
and rivers to rise before the the heavier rain on Sunday.

While the cold front on Saturday is relatively straight forward,
the Sunday system is much more complicated. It is driven by a
strong low pressure that is just now beginning to form in the
Central Pacific. This system will scream across the Pacific over
the next 48-72 hours, taking advantage of the combined forces of
the Polar Front and Subtropical jet streams. Model guidance is
indicating the jet stream will be as strong as 200 mph at 250 mb.
In addition to giving the storm a ride, this strong jet stream
will also cause the system to deepen, especially if the surface
low pressure center becomes oriented under the front left
divergent quadrant of the jet max. If this happens, the storm will
likely undergo explosive cyclogenesis. Another interesting point
about this system is that as it approaches the coast on Sunday, it
will gain latitude and loose the jet support that defined its
early life. This is concerning as it means the storm will loose
steering flow and likely hang around offshore for a few days
before weakening or moving inland. The TLDR for this paragraph is
that the Sunday system is complicated and that makes it hard to
predict accurately.

Despite the uncertainty, there haven`t been any major changes to
the long range forecast tonight. The total QPF from Sunday-
Wednesday has increased by 1/4 to 1/2", but that`s basically
within the noise at this point. Total accumulation from Sunday
through Wednesday is now expected to be 1.5-3" in the lowlands and
3-6" in the mountains. It`s also looking more and more likely
that Sunday night will be the most impactful period during this
extended event. This is when the triple point (confluence of warm,
cold, and occluded front) has the best chance to come ashore. If
this happens, expect stronger showers with a decent chance for
thunderstorms overnight. Sunday evening will also bring the
strongest winds, with sustained southerly winds of 25-35 mph along
the coast and at higher elevations, and 15-25 mph in the inland
valleys. Stronger lowland winds are possible in N-S oriented
valleys, including the Santa Clara and Salinas Vallies. After this
shot of activity, the cut-off low will begin to weaken and shower
activity will slowly taper off from Monday-Wednesday.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 345 AM PST Fri Feb 16 2024

VFR through the majority of the TAF period. One exception is a
chance for MVFR mist or IFR fog at STS or APC before the sun
comes up later this morning. Additionally, all terminals will
start to develop MVFR ceilings overnight Friday heading into a
nasty day Saturday with strong southerly winds and MVFR or IFR
ceilings and visibility in rain showers.

Vicinity of SFO...Currently VFR with high clouds and gentle ESE
winds. Other than a potential shift to onshore winds Friday
afternoon, conditions will remain similar until ceilings drop
Saturday morning. The real coherent band of rain will likely roll
through Saturday afternoon but VCSH are possible within the last
6 hours of the TAF period.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...Currently VFR with high clouds and breezy
drainage flow at SNS. Winds will shift onshore in the afternoon
and ceilings will begin to drop overnight. Conditions will
deteriorate on Saturday.

.MARINE...
(Today through Wednesday)
Issued at 345 AM PST Fri Feb 16 2024

Friday is the last day for favorable conditions in the coastal
waters for nearly a week. An approaching cold front will bring a
strong southerly breeze on Saturday. At the same time, a moderate
rough westerly swell will arrive. The combination of these will
generate hazardous conditions for small and medium-sized vessels,
with combined significant wave heights of 14-18 feet on Saturday.
These seas will remain elevated through Tuesday before gradually
abating below 12 feet on Wednesday.

&&

.BEACHES...
Issued at 118 AM PST Fri Feb 16 2024

Incoming large westerly swell will arrive Saturday and cause
large breaking waves of 18 to 22 feet along exposed, west-facing
beaches. Locally higher waves of 28 feet are possible along some
favored areas with steep beaches. In addition to the westerly
swell, strong southerly winds will enhance the energy in the surf
zone, creating dangerous conditions for surfers and swimmers.
Inexperienced swimmer should remain out of the water. All
beachgoers are strongly encouraged to respect the power of the
ocean and reminded to never turn their back to the water. Large
waves can sweep across the beach without warning, pulling people
into the sea from rocks, jetties, and beaches. These waves can
also move large objects such as logs, crushing anyone caught
underneath. A high surf advisory is in effect from 10 AM Saturday
to 4 PM Sunday.

.HYDROLOGY...
Issued at 118 AM PST Fri Feb 16 2024

A series of storms forecasted to move through the region
this weekend and into the first half of next week will bring the
potential for moderate to rapid rises along area creeks, streams,
and rivers across the region. Soil moisture remains high from
previous storms earlier this month and will reach saturation this
weekend as the first of three cold fronts moves through the area.
Once saturated, additional rainfall will runoff resulting in
moderate to rapid rises on our creeks, streams, and rivers, as
well as lead to nuisance and/or minor flooding. Latest river
forecasts from the CNRFC depict an initial rise on area creeks,
streams, and rivers on Saturday and Saturday night with a larger
rise on Monday and Tuesday. The latest update from CNRFC lowered
the probabilities of reaching flood stage for most of the rivers.
The current ensemble guidance from the CNRFC indicates the Russian
River at Guerneville, the San Lorenzo River at Big Trees and the
Carmel River at Robles del Rio have a 20% chance of reaching flood
stage in the next 5 day while the Salinas River at Spreckels and
Pajaro River at Chittenden which will be slower to crest will have
a 20% chance of reaching flood stage in the next 10 days.
Although most sites are forecast to remain below flood stage, some
locations may reach monitor stage or minor flood stage.

Model guidance suggests greatest accumulation of precipitation
will be observed along the coastal ranges. Rainfall totals remain
consistent with 1 to 3 inches expected across most areas with 3-6
inches expected over favored peaks and higher terrain of the
coastal hills and mountains.

USGS instrumentation throughout the San Francisco Bay Area
indicates that shallow soils on steep hillsides are approaching
saturation. This coupled with the forecasted precipitation means
shallow landslides are possible. Expect localized ponding of
water in low-lying or poorly drained areas, such as freeway
offramps.
