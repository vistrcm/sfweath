...New SYNOPSIS, SHORT TERM, LONG TERM, AVIATION, MARINE...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 332 AM PST Sun Nov 19 2023

Breezy and gusty conditions build through the day, peaking into
the late night. Calm weather returns for the work week with a
warming and drying trend ahead of the holiday weekend.

&&

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 332 AM PST Sun Nov 19 2023

It`s a much calmer night as the trough moves out of the region and a
ridge builds. This pattern change will cause gusty northerly winds
to build across the region today with the strongest winds expected
over all hills and mountains. Recent model updates have reduced the
gradient between the high and low pressures resulting in some
reduction in the strongest winds, but several areas will see 15 to
30 mph gust this afternoon and into the late night with higher
elevations seeing infrequent gusts above 45 mph into the late
night.

&&

.LONG TERM...
(Monday through Saturday)
Issued at 332 AM PST Sun Nov 19 2023

Winds reduce into the work week as the ridge continues to build.
This will also kick off a warming and drying trend through the mid
week. The ridge collapses in the mid to late week, but is quickly
replaced by another ridge of roughly equal value with slight
hints of short-lived gusty winds in between.

Longer-term models show the second ridge lasting well into the
weekend, making for an extended dry period. The end of the longer-
term model runs branch off significantly, but keep things dry for
different reasons.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 332 AM PST Sun Nov 19 2023

All traces of shower activity have now left the region, and
generally clear skies prevail. Satellite imagery shows patchy fog
and low stratus across the interior portions of the Central Coast,
and shallow fog development is also possible in the North Bay
valleys and the interior terminals as recent rainfall enhances low
level humidity. Breezy northwesterly flow will develop this
afternoon, with speeds up to 10-15 knots expected, before light
winds return overnight. Moderate confidence of LLWS across the North
and East Bays as surface winds decouple later this evening.

Vicinity of SFO...VFR through the TAF period, with breezy northwest
winds through the evening hours. Moderate confidence in the exact
speed and direction of winds through the afternoon, with model
output suggesting a more northerly flow and gusts up to 25 knots.
Winds become light in the evening.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...Generally VFR through the day, with
potential shallow fog at SNS before sunrise. Breezy northwest winds
through the evening hours, with winds turning light this evening.


&&

.MARINE...
(Today through Friday)
Issued at 332 AM PST Sun Nov 19 2023

Shower activity has dissipated and clear conditions are expected
for the rest of the week. Winds will become gusty later this
morning through Monday, posing hazardous conditions to small
craft. A northwest swell arrives Sunday causing 10-13 foot waves
in the outer waters.

&&
