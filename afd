...New AVIATION...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 1218 PM PDT Sun Mar 23 2025

Warmer than average temperatures through Tuesday before a cool-
down and more disturbed weather returns later in the week.

&&

.UPDATE...
Issued at 847 PM PDT Sun Mar 23 2025

No change in the forecast tonight with much warmer temperatures
ready to set in for Monday and Tuesday under a progressive but
gradually amplified ridge over the west to start the work week.
Temperatures are on track to be 15-20 degrees above normal both
days before a trough quickly fills in behind the exiting ridge to
the east, to cool us off for the remainder of the extended
forecast. There is a slight chance of light rain, mostly over the
North Bay late Wednesday and Thursday.

.SHORT TERM...
(This evening through Monday)
Issued at 1218 PM PDT Sun Mar 23 2025

The skies have cleared as a ridge over the Eastern Pacific builds
and slowly drifts towards the coast. Temperatures have climbed
into the 60s, and will continue to warm another 5-10 degrees
through the early afternoon for most. The exception is along
portions of the immediate coast, where a sea breeze is ushering in
a shallow marine layer, low clouds, higher dew points, and
stabilizing the temperature. As the ridge continues to build into
Monday, large scale subsidence will cause the lower atmosphere to
continue warming. The 850 mb temperature is now expected to reach
somewhere between 15-16C, which puts it in the 97-99th percentile
for March. This high atmospheric heat will translate to surface
temperatures as high as 20 degrees above normal Monday. Coastal
areas will mostly be in the 70s, with mid 80s inland. Regionally,
we haven`t seen temperatures this high since last fall.

.LONG TERM...
(Monday night through next Saturday)
Issued at 1218 PM PDT Sun Mar 23 2025

Tuesday temperatures will be a repeat of Monday, with more record
breaking heat expected. The latest forecast trend has been
slightly warmer Tuesday, which now may be a degree or two warmer
than Monday for most, depending on wind direction. Inland areas
will be in the mid to upper 80s with 70s continuing along the
coast. There is also an interesting development in the atmospheric
stability starting Tuesday. While the surface and 850 mb
temperatures are expected to approach record levels, the upper
troposphere is still relatively cool. The 300 mb temperatures is
expected to be around -45C, which is the median for this time of
year. So we have anomalously warm temperatures in the lower
atmosphere with more typical early Spring temperature aloft. Cold
air over warm is unstable, and the expected surface CAPE values
shoot up to well over 1000 J/kg in some models. Despite the high
instability metric, we are not expecting much impacts on Tuesday.
Surface CAPE is highly dependent on the surface dew point. In this
case, the marine layer moisture is limited to the first 500 feet
above the surface, with much drier air above the boundary layer.
To avoid this high surface dependency, a more reasonable approach
is the 100 mb mixed layer CAPE, which is only around 100 J/kg.
Couple this with large scale subsidence under high pressure and
lack of a lifting mechanism, and the high surface CAPE will
likely not amount to much.

The ridge will move inland by Wednesday, allowing temperatures to
retreat back to normal by Thursday. An approaching trough will
bring increased cloud cover, gusty winds, and a chance for a few
rain drops through the end of the week. In the extended range,
there is still a chance for an atmospheric river next week. The
ensemble guidance has ticked down a bit from yesterday, but there
is still a high chance for 1"+ of rain across the Bay Area and
Central Coast.

.AVIATION...
(06Z TAFS)
Issued at 1040 PM PDT Sun Mar 23 2025

Currently VFR at all terminals with high confidence in VFR
prevailing through the TAF period with the exception of HAF which is
currently LIFR with stratus beginning to erode. A ridge of high
pressure will continue to support drier, warmer conditions and a
shallow marine layer that will remain confined to the coast. Winds
will be diurnal through the TAF period.

Vicinity of SFO...Currently VFR with westerly flow. High confidence
in VFR through the TAF period. Winds will back through the TAF
period.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...Currently VFR with westerly flow at MRY and
VFR with northerly flow at SNS. Winds will be diurnal through the
TAF period.

.MARINE...
(Tonight through next Saturday)
Issued at 847 PM PDT Sun Mar 23 2025

A fresh northerly breeze on Monday will diminish to become
moderate Tuesday. Seas will flux between moderate and rough
through Wednesday. Conditions deteriorate Thursday when
northwesterly breezes become fresh and seas become very rough.

.BEACHES...
Issued at 411 PM PDT Sun Mar 23 2025

A Beach Hazards Statement is in effect through 11 PM Tuesday for
all Pacific Coast beaches. The warm conditions on land will do
nothing to the Pacific Ocean that is 51-57 degrees. In addition to
the cold water shock risk that is always present, there will be
an increased risk for sneaker waves and rip currents. Observe the
ocean for 20 minutes before you pick a spot on the beach, stay off
of jetties and rocks, keep pets on a leash, wear a life jacket,
and never turn your back on the ocean!
