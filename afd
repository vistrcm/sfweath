...New AVIATION, MARINE...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 1203 AM PDT Wed Apr 30 2025

While we could see some fog and a few isolated rain drops today,
overall fair conditions will persist through Friday. A cold front
will bring strong winds, cooler temperatures, and a slight chance
for rain this weekend.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 1203 AM PDT Wed Apr 30 2025

The threat for fog returns later this morning. The marine layer is
currently around 1,000 feet according to area profilers. With some
light dry offshore wind in the North Bay, the best chance for fog
is along the San Francisco Peninsula coast and Monterey Bay
region, including Big Sur and the Salinas Valley. A few upper
level clouds and some wind could limit radiation fog, but even so,
the typical foothill locations will almost certainly be dealing
with reduced visibility in the marine layer cloud deck. Slightly
elevated coastal areas such as Corallitos and Hurricane Point
have the best chance.

A weak short wave trough is moving from north to south across
California today. This system will bring slightly colder air to
the upper levels while the surface temperature remains warm. With
relatively high moisture (PW around 0.8") and conditionally
unstable lapse rates, there is a chance for some isolated
convection today. In fact the HRRR, NAM, and ECMWF deterministic
model soundings for Santa Rosa all agree that the MUCAPE will
exceed 1,000 J/kg this afternoon. On the other hand, some weak
offshore winds will keep the low-level moisture suppressed and
there will be a bit of convective inhibition below the LCL. Most
likely if this convection is realized, it will only create some
puffy cumulus clouds. There is very little support in the guidance
for thunderstorms, or even rain, but there is still a non-zero
chance based on the instability and relatively high integrated
moisture.

.LONG TERM...
(Thursday through Tuesday)
Issued at 1203 AM PDT Wed Apr 30 2025

By Thursday the weak disturbance and associated instability will
move into southern California. This will allow the ridge to
rebuild over northern and central California, bringing us another
day of warm inland temperatures and cool marine layer conditions
along the coast. Temperatures will start to fall a bit on Friday
as a much more robust trough approaches the coast. This system
will support a fast moving cold front at the surface late Friday
or early Saturday, and could bring some pre-frontal rain. The
models have almost universally backed off on the rain chances, but
we still have PoPs around 15%. While we expect overcast skies and
much cooler temperatures, the biggest story with this system is
wind. The trough will spawn a cut-off low that moves into Southern
California by Saturday. The gradient between the low and higher
pressure over the Eastern Pacific will support 50-70 mph winds at
500 mb. As the atmosphere becomes well mixed Saturday afternoon,
some of this momentum will transfer down to the surface where NW
winds of 15-30 mph, and gusts as high as 50 mph are expected. The
strongest winds will be along the coast and in higher terrain.

By Sunday the low will start to move inland towards the desert
Southwest. We will still be dealing with lingering strong winds,
but it should be an improvement over Saturday. Early next week a
ridge will start to rebuild, decreasing the wind speed and causing
the temperatures will gradually recover. By mid-week we should be
back to the nice seasonal weather we`ve had this week.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 406 AM PDT Wed Apr 30 2025

Currently a mixed bag of VFR-IFR at the terminals. The marine
layer depth is at 1,600 feet and is expected to deepen as a
shortwave trough traverses the region from north to south. As a
result, ceilings and visibilities will be relatively higher in
addition to being able to mix out relatively quicker. VFR is
expected by this afternoon with clouds sticking to the coast.
Winds will be diurnal through the TAF period.

Vicinity of SFO...Currently VFR with westerly flow. It`s going to
be another nail biter this morning with IFR/MVFR stratus to the
north of OAK and SFO within the San Francisco Bay. The time period
of possibility for stratus to make a run at the terminal is
between now and 17Z.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...Currently IFR with westerly flow at MRY
and IFR with northerly flow at SNS. Both terminals will begin to
gradually improve by mid-to-late morning, but low clouds are
expected to hug the coast throughout the day. Diurnal winds will
prevail through the TAF period with a return to IFR conditions
towards the end of the TAF period.

.MARINE...
(Today through Monday)
Issued at 406 AM PDT Wed Apr 30 2025

Strong northwesterly breezes with near-gale force gusts will
continue over the outer waters through Thursday morning along
with rough seas. Strong northwesterly breezes return Friday
afternoon, strengthening to become gale-force by Saturday. Rough
seas return to the outer waters by Saturday.

.MTR WATCHES/WARNINGS/ADVISORIES...

PZ...Small Craft Advisory until 9 AM PDT this morning for Pigeon Pt
     to Pt Pinos 10-60 NM-Pt Arena to Pt Reyes 0-10 nm.

     Small Craft Advisory until 3 PM PDT Thursday for Pt Arena to Pt
     Reyes 10-60 NM.
