.UPDATE...
Issued at 904 AM PST Wed Dec 3 2025

High clouds are streaming across the Bay Area and Central Coast,
with some lingering stratus continuing to dissipate over the
southern reaches of Monterey County. Gusty offshore winds persist
across the higher elevations of the Bay Area, with the strongest
gusts overnight reported at the Healdsburg Hills North station
operated by PG&E, which reported a 72 mph gust at 450 AM. The
SFO-WMC gradient has relaxed through the morning, reaching its
strongest at 7 AM with a gradient of -8.9 mb, to a observed value
of -6.6 mb as of 9 AM. With the models expecting a gradual
weakening of the offshore gradient over the next 24 hours, this
supports a continuation of the offshore flow, although the gusts
will gradually relax through the day into tonight.

.SHORT TERM...
Issued at 141 AM PST Wed Dec 3 2025
(Today and tonight)

Satellite imagery this morning shows stratus in the valleys
surrounding the Bay Area and the interior Central Coast; however,
the growth of the stratus is slowly getting cut off as the offshore
pressure gradient tightens bringing in drier air to the region.
Offshore winds have already started to ramp up for the North Bay
mountains, with the highest points in Mayacamas and Sonoma mountains
peaking around 50-55mph. Winds will continue for the rest of the Bay
Area and Santa Lucia mountains, peaking by mid morning and the
gradually decreasing as we head into the afternoon and evening.
Given the earlier rains this season, fire weather concerns remain
low due to moist fuels.

.LONG TERM...
Issued at 141 AM PST Wed Dec 3 2025
(Thursday through Tuesday)

The extended forecast remains persistent, with quiet weather
returning for Thursday and lasting into next week. Ensemble
forecasts show mainly upper level ridging, with some quasi-zonal
flow at times, holding into mid to late next week. High temperatures
are seasonal for the start of the forecast period, and increase to
above average for this time of year through mid next week.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 425 AM PST Wed Dec 3 2025

Moderate to breezy easterly winds are building into the region. The
increase in winds and dry air will erode cloud cover and fog across
the region, leading to widespread VFR into the mid morning. North to
northeast winds last through the day but ease into the early night.
Low clouds fail to return again for Wednesday night

Vicinity of SFO...VFR through the TAF period. Easterly winds are
building and this dry flow has eroded the lower clouds. Winds build
in and become breezy to gusty before the mid morning. Gusts reduce
into the evening and winds become lighter into the night. Moderate
northerly winds arrive into early Thursday.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...VFR through the TAF period. Light to
moderate easterly winds last through much of the morning before
turning more northerly into the afternoon. Winds weaken and become
light and variable into the evening before increasing and turning
southeasterly into the late night.

.MARINE...
(Today through Monday)
Issued at 851 AM PST Wed Dec 3 2025

Moderate NW winds will persist through the day and decrease to a
gentle breeze by Thursday. Rough seas in the outer waters will
gradually diminish overnight as the winds ease and westerly swell
abates. After a brief favorable weather window on Thursday,
northerly winds will increase to a fresh to strong breeze on
Friday, rebuilding moderate seas up to 8 feet.

.BEACHES...
Issued at 425 AM PST Wed Dec 3 2025

A Beach Hazards Statement remains in effect for the coastline
from Sonoma County to Monterey County through 10 PM PST Wednesday
evening. Breaking waves 10 to 14 feet, with long lulls of 10 to 20
minutes or more between largest sets can be expected. Some of the
favored break points may exceed 20 feet at times. Forerunners
will be 18+ seconds with heights of 2-5 feet into tonight
resulting in the greatest risk for sneaker waves. This combined
with high astronomical tides in the morning hours will increase
the aforementioned risk. Sneaker waves can unexpectedly run
significantly farther up the beach than normal, including over
rocks and jetties. Rip currents are typically more frequent and
stronger in the vicinity of jetties, inlets, and piers.
