.SHORT TERM...
Issued at 325 AM PST Mon Jan 26 2026
(Today and tonight)

Progressive short wave troughing today will give way to progressive
ridging tonight with the ridge axis shifting east of our area by
early Tuesday morning. Patchy fog is expected to develop overnight
in portions of the North Bay, East Bay and South Bay with coverage
or duration not expected to necessitate an advisory attm. Southerly
boundary layer winds combined with weak offshore surface winds will
help lift temperatures a few degrees across the interior from
Sundays highs, remaining right around the same along the coast.
Cloudy skies this morning will give way to a mix of sun and clouds
this afternoon, especially inland further helping the modest
temperature increases.

.LONG TERM...
Issued at 325 AM PST Mon Jan 26 2026
(Tuesday through Sunday)

Extended forecast remains on track with rain chances increasing
Tuesday evening, continuing through Wednesday morning. HiRes
HRRR/RRFS focus primarily on the North Bay struggling to reach 0.10"
with NBM PoPs possibly a little overdone with chances to the south
as the best lift associated with the surface boundary continuing to
shift north of our area. Drier conditions will persist for the
remainder of the week with persistent ridging while the signal for
another round of scattered light beneficial rain next weekend
beginning to fade while temperatures trend warmer for the weekend,
especially across the Central Coast.
