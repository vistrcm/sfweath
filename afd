.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 1211 AM PDT Mon Apr 1 2024

High pressure will bring warming temperature and quiet weather for
today into Tuesday. Rain chances return for late week with below
normal temperatures persisting into the weekend.

&&

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 1211 AM PDT Mon Apr 1 2024

The axis of a high pressure ridge aloft will extend from the
northeast Pacific through the Pacific Northwest states. This will
support surface high pressure extending from the northeast Pacific
into the central Great Basin. This pattern will bring clearing
skies, modest onshore winds, and milder temperatures. Highs today
will range from around 65 on the coast to around 75 in the warmest
inland valleys. Overnight readings will remain seasonal with lows
mostly in the mid 40s inland to around 50 along the immediate coast.

&&

.LONG TERM...
(Tuesday through Sunday)
Issued at 1211 AM PDT Mon Apr 1 2024

The axis of the upper ridge will locate across the area on Tuesday
bringing quiet weather and the warmest day in the extended forecast
period. With plentiful sunshine look for afternoon highs to range
from the mid to upper 60s along the coast to the mid 70s inland.
Some of the warmest areas bordering the Sacramento Valley and within
the southern Salinas Valley may even approach 80. Overnight lows
will mostly be in the upper 40s to around 50.

Some cooling will commence by Wednesday as a weak cold front pushes
through ahead of upstream troughing over the northeast Pacific.

The trough will swing through the region by late week with
sufficiently short wavelength to close off an upper low near the CA
coast on Thursday into Friday. This pattern will bring breezy
onshore winds, cooler temperatures, and renewed rain chances. There
has been a slight upward trend among global ensemble members with
regards to rain amounts in the Thursday to Friday range. Totals at
the moment appear to around from around 0.1" for inland portions of
the area to around 0.5"-1" for the Santa Cruz and Santa Lucia
Mountains. There does appear to be a little instability with this
system as well, so localized higher totals might be possible in
convection. For now, thunder chances remain below mention (10%) but
we will keep an eye on this with future forecast updates. Another
weak system may move in by the early portion of next week keeping
rain chances in the picture. Temperatures look to stay below
seasonal averages during this entire period with a cool and damp
start to the month of April.
