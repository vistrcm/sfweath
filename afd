...New UPDATE and FIRE WEATHER...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 210 AM PDT Sat Jul 20 2024

A bit cooler this weekend as a weak system moves through. Warm up
still slated for early next week with moderate to major HeatRisk.
Potential for a more substantial cool down towards the end of next
week.

.UPDATE...
Issued at 859 AM PDT Sat Jul 20 2024

Morning satellite shows decent cloud coverage along the coast
south of the Golden Gate. These clouds are associated with a
marine layer, which is sitting at a depth of approx. 1k feet per
Fort Ord profiler. Onshore flow combined with the marine layer
allowed the clouds to push up much of the Salinas Valley. Despite
some inland clearing late today of clouds, coastal areas around
portions of Monterey Bay will struggle to completely clear. One
may also notice some haze showing up on the morning satellite.
This haze is actually some high level smoke from all of the
wildfire activity around the state. Fortunately, most of the
smoke appears to be high based and slowly tracking northward.

As noted below, today will show a cooling trend overall with the
biggest drop along the coast and bays. Well inland areas may
technically cool from yesterday temperatures will still soar into
the upper 90s to lower 100s. Therefore, moderate HeatRisk for
interior locations.

No update needed...

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 210 AM PDT Sat Jul 20 2024

Still warm today, but temps are on their way down for the weekend.
Many locations should shave off 3-5 degrees compared to yesterday.
The Heat Advisory is no longer in effect for the weekend, but
temps far inland are still rather warm, so those especially
sensitive to heat should still exercise caution. The real story
for today comes later this evening when a transient shortwave
trough skirts through our area, causing a deepening of the marine
layer, cooler overnight temps tonight, and another few degrees
shaved off the afternoon highs tomorrow. In addition to cooler
temps, the trough is expected to bring some wind to the area.
Particularly along coastal and gap areas. The timing of this looks
to be late afternoon to early evening, which is ideal because peak
heating will have passed and humidity will be on the rise.
Therefore, fire weather concerns for today are primarily fuel
driven where we are seeing near record energy release component
among 10- and 100-hour fuels in the North Bay.

.LONG TERM...
(Sunday through Friday)
Issued at 210 AM PDT Sat Jul 20 2024

Sunday looks to be rather pleasant as temps drop a little bit
further. If you live in inland areas, this will be your chance to
spend some time outside before the next heat event. Once the
trough completely moves out by Sunday night, 500 mb height rises
continue as a ridge starts to build back in. Currently targeting
Monday through Thursday as the period of interest in which we will
see elevated HeatRisk. Particularly Tuesday and Wednesday where
areas of the South Bay and inland East Bay will see more on the
side of major HeatRisk. In terms of temps, it`s looking on par
with what we just went through. 100-105 inland, 85-95 along the
Bay, 65-75 along the coast. The marine layer looks to remain
intact as onshore flow prevails, so the thinking is that the coast
will once again be mostly shielded. We are assessing the need for
heat hazards that will likely be posted for Monday-Thursday, so
stay tuned for the latest information. On a lighter note,
temperatures start to cool off from Thursday into next weekend
with the potential for BELOW NORMAL afternoon highs by next
Saturday. There is still some uncertainty, but ensemble cluster
analysis seems to advertise this pattern relatively well, which
would result in at least some degree of cooling.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 434 AM PDT Sat Jul 20 2024

Coastal stratus and fog /LIFR-IFR/ are developing this morning, inland
it`s VFR. The ACV-SFO pressure gradient is 7.3 mb and predominates while
the SFO-SAC pressure gradient is 2.6 mb. Onshore breezes to gusty winds
will develop today ushering cooler air inland, the cooler air also helping
to deepen the marine layer today and tonight.

Vicinity of SFO... VFR today with an increasingly gusty west wind,
afternoon and evening wind gusts to 32 knots possibly a little higher
since the NAM is forecasting 5 mb SFO-SAC pressure gradient later today
and tonight. HREF output shows IFR ceiling tonight and Sunday morning.

SFO Bridge Approach... Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...LIFR-IFR in stratus, fog and possibly patchy
morning drizzle. Conditions only gradually improving to MVFR-VFR by
late morning and afternoon, the stratus may be slow to mix out along
the immediate Monterey Bay shoreline per recent HREF output. LIFR-IFR
in stratus and fog tonight and Sunday morning.

.MARINE...
(Today through Thursday)
Issued at 418 AM PDT Sat Jul 20 2024

Gusty northwest winds continuing over the coastal waters through
the weekend, with gale force gusts mainly across the northern
waters. In the unprotected waters, short period seas will
deteriorate to very rough by Sunday. Gusty winds will persist into
the work week over the outer waters.

.FIRE WEATHER...
Issued at 900 AM PDT Sat Jul 20 2024

...Near critical fire weather conditions continue through
Saturday due to hot and dry conditions inland...

Just finished conference calls with fire agencies and partners.
Biggest near term concerns will be near critical fire weather
conditions today, especially later this afternoon/early this
evening. While a marine layer developed overnight, it is rather
shallow and dry conditions persist above it (1,000 feet).

While today will be a few degrees cooler, far interior locations
will remain hot and dry. In addition, onshore flow persists and
recent guidance suggests rather strong onshore flow for about 3
to 6 hours late this afternoon. This will allow for a period of
time with stronger bursts of wind (30-40 mph) with low RH. Any
fire starts will likely spread quickly. Areas of greatest concern
will be the gaps/passes of the East Bay with very flashy fuels.

Further cooling is expected on Sunday and thankfully weaker winds.

Looking farther down the road, hot and dry conditions rebuild
early next week. Will also be keeping a close eye on some upper
level moisture, which at the moment has a non-zero for high-based
thunderstorms.
