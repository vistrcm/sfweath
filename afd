...New AVIATION, MARINE...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 1102 AM PDT Fri Aug 16 2024

Seasonal to slightly cooler than normal temperatures will continue
through the weekend into next week. Increased coverage of early
morning marine layer stratus, fog and drizzle is likely this
weekend. Less than 10% chance for thunder on Saturday.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 1251 AM PDT Sat Aug 17 2024

The main feature dominating our weather this weekend is an upper
level trough over the West Coast. Most of the region remains
clear, with some patchy stratus developing in western San Mateo
County. Current expectation is for the stratus deck offshore to
slowly approach and then impact the coastal regions through the
morning hours, with the inland stratus mixing out through the
afternoon and evening. Model output is showing some instability
associated with the approaching trough, but chances for
thunderstorms remain low today, concentrated in the North Bay with
probabilities less than 10%.

With the trough`s arrival, temperatures will cool down rather
remarkably with the inland valleys seeing temperatures in the mid
70s to mid 80s, perhaps up to the low 90s in the warmest spots of
the Central Coast. For the coastal regions, in addition to seeing
highs in the mid 50s to the mid 60s, coastal drizzle will be
possible through the day.

.LONG TERM...
(Saturday night through next Thursday)
Issued at 1102 AM PDT Fri Aug 16 2024

Temperatures will start to slowly increase on Sunday and will
push some temperatures to closer to seasonal on Monday as the
upper-level ridge that builds over central CONUS will create a
OMEGA block keeping us under a troughing pattern. Maximum
temperatures will start to return to 80s to 90s inland, and 60s
along the coast, with each day showing differences by 1-3 degrees.
Therefore, relatively similar weather conditions through most of
first half of the work week.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 443 AM PDT Sat Aug 17 2024

Low marine stratus has struggled to make eastward progress
overnight toward the coastline but has ultimately reached the
KSFO and KOAK terminals. Otherwise expect VFR conditions to
prevail with daytime heating and increased mixing out ahead of
deepening low approaching from the west.

Vicinity of SFO...MVFR/IFR ceilings are expected to persist
through mid/late morning before clearing out for the afternoon
and evening. Gusty onshore winds can be expected during the
afternoon and early evening once again. More widespread low marine
stratus ceilings can be expected later this evening.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...Low marine stratus ceilings have lingered
offshore and continue to struggle to work east toward Monterey Bay.
They`re likely to reach the terminals eventually, while coinciding
with daytime heating and increase lift from approaching system to
our west. Maintained a tempo group to account for uncertainty in
both timing and extent in coverage. Low stratus cloud deck should
return earlier Saturday evening than what has been seen the last
few nights.

&&

.MARINE...
(Today through Thursday)
Issued at 443 AM PDT Sat Aug 17 2024

An upper level low pressure system will move south today off the
Pacific Northwest and far northern California coast. This low will
become nearly stationary through the middle of next week. Winds
will ease over the coastal waters this weekend except remain
breezy over the San Francisco Bay each afternoon and evening.

&&

.MTR WATCHES/WARNINGS/ADVISORIES...
CA...None.
PZ...Small Craft Advisory from 9 AM this morning to 9 PM PDT this
     evening for SF Bay N of Bay Bridge.
