...New UPDATE, MARINE...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 230 AM PDT Sat Apr 12 2025

A cooler Saturday is on tap, with a warming trend starting on Sunday
and continuing into early next week. Minor HeatRisk returns Sunday
and Monday for much of the region, with high temperatures falling a
few degrees for midweek placing us closer to normal for this time of
year.

.UPDATE...
Issued at 901 AM PDT Sat Apr 12 2025

Pretty chilly morning! Temperatures are definitely running colder
this morning, with areas seeing anywhere between 5-15 degrees
lower than yesterday morning. Therefore, the forecast remains on
track with no anticipated changes at this moment.

&&

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 230 AM PDT Sat Apr 12 2025

Satellite imagery this morning shows a band of high cloud streaming
over the Bay Area and Central Coast. Beneath that, pockets of
stratus can be seen in Marin Co, some of the valleys in the East
bay, hugging portions of the San Francisco, San Mateo, and Santa
Cruz coasts, and finally some sprawling around the Monterey Bay and
into the the adjacent valleys. This trend should continue through
the morning and generally favor  stratus than fog while the winds
are up. Should you encounter fog this morning, remember to slow down
and leave extra time to reach your destination. Once the stratus
mixes out by mid to late morning, look for mostly clear skies. Highs
for today peak in the mid 50s to low 60s for much of the coast and
low to mid 70s for interior valleys. Tonight, we may see some
patches of stratus again, though it may stay more confined to
coastal communities along San Mateo County and the Monterey Bay.
There is some signal for patchy stratus in the valleys of the North
Bay and northern valleys of Monterey County.

.LONG TERM...
(Sunday through Friday)
Issued at 230 AM PDT Sat Apr 12 2025

No major changes in the long term portion of the forecast. Models
and ensembles show weak ridging building into the region by Sunday
and then holding through Monday. As a result, we will see a warming
trend for this period with high temperatures being about 5 to 15
degrees above average for this time of year. Minor HeatRisk is
expected across the region, meaning this level of heat primarily
affects those extremely sensitive. A few ways to combat the heat
include taking frequent breaks with adequate cooling, staying
hydrated, and wearing light colored and loose fitting clothes.

As we head into midweek, the pattern changes once again as an upper
level low forms off the coast by Tuesday. Ensembles and models
generally tend to favor the low forming west of the southern CA,
though some models try to creep it towards the southern portion of
the Central Coast. This will decrease high temperatures for Tuesday
and likely continue the trend into Wednesday and Thursday. Though on
Wednesday, cluster analysis shows high pressure building over the
eastern Pacific and then nudge its way east towards and into the
West Coast towards the latter half of the week. This should spur
another warming trend for the weekend. &&

.AVIATION...
(06Z TAFS)
Issued at 949 PM PDT Fri Apr 11 2025

Winds are reducing and will be light to moderate for all but SFO,
which stays breezy into Saturday morning. MVFR/IFR CIGs build
along the coast and the Monterey Bay in the mid evening. Some
scattered clouds will form in the more interior areas, but do not
look to form consistent CIGs. Cloud cover erodes in the interior
through the mid morning, but coastal and Monterey Bay CIGs linger
into the late morning and early afternoon. Breezy west winds
return for Saturday afternoon with some gustier conditions for the
SF Bay.

Vicinity of SFO...VFR through the TAF period. Expect the evening`s
gusty winds to reduce into the early night, but still remain
breezy. Winds reduce further into the night, becoming moderate for
early Saturday. Gusty west winds arrive in the mid afternoon and
look to reduce again into early Saturday night.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO

Monterey Bay Terminals...MVFR/IFR CIGS are forming around the
terminals with mostly light winds. Mist and drizzle look to
affect the Monterey Bay into the early morning, leading to some
reductions in visibility. VFR returns in the late morning and
early afternoon and moderate west winds build. These winds reduce
into Saturday evening.
