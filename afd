.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 100 AM PST Fri Mar 7 2025

Satellite imagery shows generally clear skies across the region with
patches of fog and stratus along the coast and in the higher
elevations. Some stratus development is possible this morning across
the Central Coast and the Santa Clara Valley. Otherwise, the clear
skies will promote radiational cooling and lead to chilly mornings
across the inland valleys. A Frost Advisory is in effect for the
North Bay valleys, the southern Salinas Valley, the East Bay and
eastern Santa Clara hills, the Santa Lucias, and the mountains of
interior Monterey and San Benito counties, until 9 AM this morning.
Low temperatures in the advisory area will drop into the middle to
upper 30s, with temperatures in the upper 20s and the lower 30s
across the higher elevations and southern Monterey County. In the
coastal and Bayshore regions, low temperatures will reach the lower
to middle 40s.

The upper level low that brought us the last two days of showers and
storms is moving into Arizona, with an upper level ridge building
into the Pacific Northwest and northern California. Thus, today`s
weather will be dominated by clear skies and warming temperatures,
with high temperatures reaching the middle to upper 60s in the
inland valleys, with temperatures on the cooler side in the Central
Coast and warmer in the North Bay, and the middle 50s to the lower
60s in the coastal regions. Gusty winds are possible across the
coastal Central Coast and the Salinas Valley with wind gusts
reaching 20 to 25 miles per hour.

.LONG TERM...
(Saturday through Thursday)
Issued at 100 AM PST Fri Mar 7 2025

The upper level ridge will help push out the lingering remnants of
the upper level low into Sunday, helping to warm temperatures across
the Bay Area and Central Coast. High temperatures on Saturday and
Sunday will lie around  or slightly above the seasonal average, with
highs in the middle to upper 60s in the inland valleys and the upper
50s to the lower 60s in the coastal regions. Lows will remain quite
chilly on Saturday morning with lows similar to, or a couple degrees
warmer than, those seen this morning, and further Frost Advisories
might be necessary.

The succession of rain systems resumes Monday. The first system that
arrives will be relatively light with generally beneficial rain
totals. The latest forecast focuses most of the potential rainfall
across the Central Coast, with the potential for half an inch to an
inch of rain across the coastal ranges. A second system, expected
from late Tuesday into Thursday, looks to be more impactful.
Ensemble model output is beginning to coalesce on a significant
rain event with a deeper moisture tap that could impact the
entire forecast region. As the previous discussion noted, early
estimates suggest that rain totals from Tuesday afternoon to
Thursday range from 1-2" across the region, 2-3" in the North Bay,
and up to 5" in the coastal ranges. Check back with us over the
next week as the details come into better focus.
