...New LONG TERM...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 1232 PM PST Thu Dec 14 2023

A gradual warming trend will continue into the upcoming weekend.
Cooler, unsettled weather returns by the end of the weekend and
continues at times into next week.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and Saturday)
Issued at 1239 AM PST Fri Dec 15 2023

A meridional flow pattern prevails aloft this morning with upper
ridging across the western states and longwave troughing across
the eastern Pacific. Surface high pressure was centered over the
Great Basin with low-level ridging flexing towards the Pacific
waters offshore from SoCal. This pattern was producing light
offshore/drainage winds at the surface with light southerly flow
over the Pacific waters.

High pressure aloft will remain the primary weather influencer
through much of the the short term period as dry conditions and
mostly light offshore winds allow for warming temperatures.
Afternoon temperatures should be downright pleasant for most folks
both today and tomorrow as highs reach the upper 60s to mid 70s away
from the immediate coast. Some high clouds may temper readings
slightly at times, but the denser cloud coverage should hold off
until Saturday night as a closed upper low offshore wobbles closer
to the coastline.

.LONG TERM...
(Saturday through Thursday)
Issued at 450 AM PST Fri Dec 15 2023

Major changes to the pattern are in store as a storm force low
pressure system moves over the East Pacific. As this system stalls
on Sunday, the southerly flow it generates will pump moisture
into the Bay Area. Precipitable water values are expected to hover
around the 1" mark beginning Sunday. We are also starting to
notice some instability late Sunday into Monday as the deep low
moves off to the NE and brings a trough across the relatively warm
and humid Bay Area. Thunderstorm chances are currently at around
20-30% with expected CAPE values in the 200-300 J/kg range. There
is even 30+ knots 0-1km shear, suggesting these storms could
become decently organized if they are able to develop.

Beyond Monday, the stability increases and the thunderstorm threat
decreases. Rain, however, is expected to linger through Thursday.
While this is still low confidence, the guidance is suggesting the
low will retreat back to the south late Tuesday. This could bring
another round of heavier showers to parts of the Bay Area, but
it`s too early to say if this will happen and where the impacts
will be. As we saw a few weeks ago, slow, meandering low pressure
systems can be tricky to pin down.

The weekly total QPF forecast has been holding remarkably steady
over the last few days, and the global model ensemble spread is
relatively tight around 2-3 inches for most locations. As the
confidence seems to grow, one outlier in the probabilistic
guidance is the NBM10/NBM90. This guidance is suggesting a
range between 0.10" and 18.00". That is not a typo, the NBM is
telling us there is a 10% chance we get more than 18 inches! None
of the global ensemble members get anywhere near half of that
upper end. Needless to say, this guidance appears to be quite
over- dispersed and was left out of our official probabilistic
messaging for partners and social media, which keeps the 10/90%
interval range between 0.5-6 inches or so. It should also be noted
that some of this spread is location dependent, with rain
shadowed areas like the Santa Clara and Salinas Valley on the low
end, and the coastal mountains on the high end.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 321 AM PST Fri Dec 15 2023

Prevailing VFR for most areas through the TAF period. Exceptions
are KSTS where IFR/LIFR in BR/FG will persist this morning and
likely return tonight and KLVK where HZ will reduce visibility
into the 4-5 sm range at times through this morning. Winds will be
light and mostly offshore with high SCT-BKN high clouds around.

Vicinity of SFO...VFR with light winds and SCT-BKN high clouds.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO

Monterey Bay Terminals...VFR with generally light winds and SCT-
BKN high clouds. Morning offshore draining flow through the
Salinas valley will keep KSTS winds elevated in the 10-15 kt range
during the night and morning hours.

.MARINE...
(Today through Wednesday)
Issued at 1239 AM PST Fri Dec 15 2023

Breezy and unsettled weather returns this weekend as a new storm
system approaches. This will also bring widespread rain, chances
for thunderstorms in the southern waters, and southerly winds.
Wind speeds will strengthen late Friday increase through the
weekend. Fresh northwest swell continues to build during this time
and a large southwest swell arrives this weekend creating waves
of 10-13 feet.
