...New UPDATE...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 1223 AM PDT Sun Mar 24 2024

Unsettled weather continues through this afternoon with rain
showers and perhaps an isolated thunderstorm. A bit drier for
Monday into Tuesday before rain chances return for mid week into
the weekend.

.UPDATE...
Issued at 856 AM PDT Sun Mar 24 2024

The morning KOAK sounding paints a decent picture of the current
atmospheric environment over the region. The sounding reveals
moderate instability with (SFC CAPE 300+ J/kg) and little to no
convective inhibition (CINH). Additionally, PWATs are sitting
near 0.6", while not crazy moist it`s still around the 75
percentile. Lastly, lapse rates are moderate to moderate/high at
7.5 C/km or conditionally unstable. So what does this all mean?
Unstable atmosphere that can support convective showers and
possibly a thunderstorm or two. Looking at KMUX radar confirms the
atmospheric environment with widespread shower activity across
the region tracking NW to SE. Haven`t observed any lightning yet,
but given the set up it`s possible. Probabilistic guidance
continues to show a 25% chc of lightning with the stronger cells.
A little bit of daytime heating may be enough to tip the chances
for lightning higher. One thing that has been observed are higher
precip rates with the stronger showers. These brief heavy showers
may lead to excessive runoff with localized ponding on area
roadways. Finally, yesterday featured a waterspout over Monterey
Bay. Today`s set up shows marginal low-level shear 0-1km. Have
already seen very weak rotation over the coastal waters with more
developed cells this morning. Will be monitoring closely for any
stronger/further development.

No updates planned. Showers and isolated thunderstorms through
early this afternoon before tapering off from N to S.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 1223 AM PDT Sun Mar 24 2024

A closed upper low over SW Oregon will gradually devolve to an open-
wave trough as it drops southeast through NorCal today. The
associated surface cyclone will dissipate with remnant troughing
locating just offshore from NorCal. The combination of steep
mid/upper lapse rates and the nearby surface trough will lead to a
continuation of scattered instability showers across the region
primarily during the first half of today. Like yesterday there
remains a little instability so can`t rule out an isolated
thunderstorm or two, but by and large showers are the most likely
forecast outcome for most. The primary weather hazards for today are
brief locally heavy rainfall, small hail, and perhaps a lightning
strike or two. Flooding impacts are unlikely as the steering flow
remains progressive and northwesterly. Readings will remain cool
with highs mostly in the 50s to around 60. Lows tonight will dip
into the 40s, with some upper 30s in southern Monterey County.

.LONG TERM...
(Monday through Saturday)
Issued at 1223 AM PDT Sun Mar 24 2024

High pressure will prevail aloft for Monday and Tuesday with drier
conditions and a slight warming trend.

A cold front attendant to low pressure over the northeast Pacific
will bring renewed rain chances for Wednesday into Thursday. Rain
amounts with this system appear beneficial and not overly impactful.

An upper low looks to evolve somewhere in the vicinity for late week
into the weekend. Deterministic models and their ensembles are in
good agreement with the general pattern, but differ somewhat in the
strength and placement of the upper low. It does appear that a
better moisture tap will accompany this system with the potential
for coastal ranges to receive 1-2" of rainfall. However there are
still some details to resolve so keep up with forecast updates.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 422 AM PDT Sun Mar 24 2024

Rain showers will continue to decrease in coverage and intensity
through the morning hours with chances becoming unmentionable by
this afternoon. While chances for thunderstorms (30%) still exist
through the morning hours, confidence is low that any will come to
fruition. VFR conditions prevail through the TAF period with
reductions in flight category possible if a shower passes directly
over a terminal. Winds will be gusty out of the W/NW with gusts of
20-30 knots to be expected.

Vicinity of SFO...Currently VFR with breezy westerly flow. Rain
shower activity will continue to diminish through the TAF period
with chances becoming unmentionable by late-morning. Winds will be
gusty out of the W/NW with gusts of 30 knots to be expected.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...Currently VFR with breezy southwesterly
flow at MRY and VFR and calm at SNS. Rain shower activity will
continue to diminish through the TAF period. Winds will be gusty
(20-30 knots) out of the W/NW at both terminals by late-morning.

.MARINE...
(Today through Friday)
Issued at 422 AM PDT Sun Mar 24 2024

Rain showers will continue to decrease in coverage and intensity
today with chances becoming unmentionable by this afternoon.
While chances for thunderstorms (30%) still exist through the
morning hours, only a few lightning strikes were recorded within
the area yesterday, and yesterday`s environment was supposed to
be the more favorable of the two days. Winds will be strong and
gusty out of the northwest today. Moderate period westerly swell
continues to abate through the waters at this time with a new
moderate period northwesterly swell train set to arrive by this
afternoon.
