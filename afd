...New UPDATE...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 103 AM PDT Tue Apr 9 2024

Fair and warm conditions continue through midweek across the Bay
Area and Central Coast. In general, afternoon highs 5-10 degrees
above normal inland by Wednesday. Another system moves in late
week into the weekend, bringing cooler weather and more rain.

.UPDATE...
Issued at 904 AM PDT Tue Apr 9 2024

The inherited short term forecast is in good shape, with just a
few minor tweaks to hourly sky grids. The start of our warming
trend commences today with above normal warmth forecast to grip
the region over the next several days. We`ll have a closer look at
the timing of our next storm system forecast to impact the Bay
Area and Central Coast. Bottom line, it looks cooler and wetter
Friday and into the weekend.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 103 AM PDT Tue Apr 9 2024

Today kicks off the short stretch of above normal temperatures as
the broad upper ridge settles over the West Coast. Most locations
will be mostly cloud-free through today, with a few exceptions
during the morning hours for some isolated locations along the
coast and up in the North Bay where dewpoints are slightly higher.
Afternoon highs expected to be generally 5-8 degrees above normal
today, with the exception being coastal areas, which will be near
normal.

.LONG TERM...
(Wednesday through Monday)
Issued at 103 AM PDT Tue Apr 9 2024

Ridge axis moves over the region by Wednesday, bringing the
warmest temperatures of the week. Afternoon highs are expected to
be 10-15 degrees above normal across inland areas, and near
to slightly above normal along coastal areas. Confidence in
regard to the high temperature forecast is on the higher side. We
will stay well away from record territory across the region.
However, with this being one of the warmest stretches since last
fall, inland areas will see minor Heat Risk through Thursday. In
this category, individuals who are extremely susceptible to heat-
related illness may experience issues when outdoors.

The above average temperatures come to an end Friday when the next
deep upper low moves into the Pacific Northwest. Cluster analysis
shows improving agreement in resolving the system through the
weekend with a bit of a slower progression. While confidence is
increasing in the initial frontal passage and associated
precipitation, the overnight forecast update includes increased
PoPs into Sunday to account for lingering showers associated with
a delayed exit of the system. At this point it is likely that most
shower activity will have exited by Sunday night, but will have to
keep an eye on adjust the end time accordingly. At any rate, it
appears the bulk of the widespread rainfall will likely fall
during the Saturday early morning to early afternoon timeframe.
Most likely amounts look to be in the 1-2" range for coastal
ranges and 0.5-1" elsewhere (decreasing inland).

By Monday, long range guidance suggests an extended period of
warm and dry conditions, on par with climatology.

VFR at all terminals this morning. Dew Point depressions continue
to shrink for N Bay terminals with possible fog. Latest guidance
suggest 10-20% chc for fog at KSTS and KAPC. Prev TAFS had tempos
for fog and left them in for now. Additionally, a few terminals
inside SF Bay reporting some haze. Will keep KOAK and KSFO clear
for now. VFR expected through at least early tonight.

Vicinity of SFO...VFR. Watching haze currently sitting at 7-8 SM.
Will keep terminal VFR for Wednesday AM as offshore flow develops
around 2,000 feet.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...Band of stratus developing in the Bay.
Included a SCT group this morning, but still expecting VFR.

.MARINE...
(Today through Sunday)
Issued at 426 AM PDT Tue Apr 9 2024

High pressure over the Eastern Pacific will maintain weak to
moderate northwest winds over the coastal waters. Winds will be
locally strong along the coast north of Point Reyes and all outer
waters. Locally stronger winds will result in hazardous conditions
for smaller craft. Winds will finally ease by midweek. A storm
system will bring unsettled weather back to the region late in the
week with increasing winds and rain.
