.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 233 AM PDT Wed Oct 23 2024

Drying trend through midweek with light offshore winds through
Thursday morning. Increasing moisture late this week into the
weekend, with a slight chance of rain for the North Bay. More
uncertainty further south.

&&

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 233 AM PDT Wed Oct 23 2024

The midweek drying trend is underway this morning with a nocturnal
drying event ongoing as of writing. Many sites above 1200-1500
feet are seeing RH in the 10-15% range across the Bay Area, and to
a lesser extent in the North Bay. The good news is that we lack
any major threat for strong offshore winds today. Weak offshore
winds are likely to develop to some degree today as the gradient
reverses, but likely not reaching critical fire weather
thresholds. By tonight, the offshore gradient strengthens a bit,
promoting a stronger push of offshore wind. Still not expecting
critical thresholds at this time, but fire danger is certainly
elevated over the next few days with peak windy conditions
occuring overnight tonight into Thursday morning.

.LONG TERM...
(Thursday through Tuesday)
Issued at 233 AM PDT Wed Oct 23 2024

The offshore-oriented pressure gradient begins to subside and
reverse Thursday once the responsible shortwave trough moves into
the northern plains. By Friday, we should start seeing the
influence of the deep upper low in the Gulf of Alaska as it makes
its way into our region. Rain chances enter the picture by late
Saturday for the North Bay and kind of linger through the early
part of the week. Like previous forecast issuances, this is
largely because of the level of uncertainty in the forecast. A
notable change this morning is that the confidence in rain chances
for the North Bay is a bit higher for the late weekend, but
amounts still uncertain, and will most likely be very light.
Elsewhere, there is still considerable uncertainty with the track
of this strong, closed low. The GFS ensemble system advertising a
slightly wetter scenario, and the ECMWF ensemble system promoting
a more interior track that would lead to dryer and potentially
windy conditions. Please stay tuned to the forecast for the latest
developments.
