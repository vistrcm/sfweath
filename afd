.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 257 AM PDT Tue Jul 11 2023

The high pressure is beginning our warming trend. Expect a warmer
day today with afternoon highs generally in the 80s and lower 90s
inland, 60s to lower 70s coast. The compressed marine layer will
offer low clouds and fog along the coast and within the deeper
valleys, but that looks to be quick to thin into afternoon.
Cloud cover looks to struggle to build tonight as the high
pressure continues to build.

.LONG TERM...
(Wednesday through Monday)
Issued at 257 AM PDT Tue Jul 11 2023

The overnight forecast package focused on fine-tuning the
temperatures for the upcoming heat, and shaping the modest cooling
into the next work week.

The second half of this week continues to offer quite the warm up
that will lead into hazardous heat into the weekend. Not only will
there be triple digit heat for the inland areas but overnight
relief from the heat could be stunted as lows only fall into the
60s and 70s in the areas of most concern. Making this heat event
feel more like a marathon than a few sprints of hot temperatures.
While coastal areas look to be spared from the warmest of the
warm, you won`t have to go far inland to see notably warmer
temperatures.

Take these next few days to plan ahead, and always have a back up
plan. Heading to the coast to escape the heat can help, but
remember that several others will have the same idea.

As usual, limit outdoor activities this weekend if you are
sensitive to heat-related illness. For those recreating, working,
or living outdoors, remember to take frequent breaks and hydrate
regularly.

Check in on elderly and heat-sensitive friends and neighbors as
many in our communities may be without adequate air conditioning.

Take care of pets and livestock.

Keep up to date on weather information this week to get the latest
on these hazards.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 432 AM PDT Tue Jul 11 2023

Satellite shows some stratus and fog lingering and also building
near the North Bay. Therefore, a mix of VFR, IFR, and LIFR
throughout the region. Anticipate stratus to clear near 16-18Z with
stratus returning in the evening. With the high pressure system
moving in, if stratus moves over any of the terminals along the
coast, expect low clouds and some fog creating IFR/LIFR conditions.
Lower confidence that North Bay terminals will receive stratus
tonight as some models suggest VFR conditions from the afternoon
through the remainder of the TAF period. Winds remain onshore and
moderate and will become breezy into the afternoon.

Vicinity of SFO...VFR but as stratus builds near the San Bruno gap,
the chance of IFR ceilings is possible. Therefore, will monitor to
determine if TEMPO group is needed. Moderate confidence that IFR
ceilings will build late tonight/early tomorrow morning, as there is
a chance stratus may remain mixed out. Winds are anticipated to
become gusty this afternoon up to 20 knots.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...LIFR conditions as the terminals seem
pretty socked in with fog and low clouds, especially near Salinas
Valley. Expect clearing near 16-17Z with winds becoming moderate to
breezy. Low clouds and fog will return tonight creating LIFR
conditions again.

.MARINE...
(Today through Sunday)
Issued at 257 AM PDT Tue Jul 11 2023

High pressure off the West Coast and low pressure inland will keep
breezy to gusty northwest winds persist over the coastal waters
through the week. Locally stronger gale force winds develop
tonight and Tuesday north of Point Reyes over the outer waters.
The stronger winds will result in steep wind waves and hazardous
conditions to small craft.
