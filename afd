...New AVIATION, MARINE...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 112 AM PST Fri Mar 1 2024

Expect a nasty couple of days ahead as a second cold front moves
through the Bay Area. Strong winds will pick up this afternoon.
Periods of rain will persist through Saturday with cold weather
sticking around into next week.

&&

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 112 AM PST Fri Mar 1 2024

The rain forecast is holding steady and gauges overnight are more
or less agreeing with the expected accumulation so far. There are
some exceptions where stronger rain bands were able to persist for
several hours. These include over 1.5" at Ben Lomond and similar
totals throughout the higher peaks in the Santa Cruz Mountains.
The Santa Lucias have also over performed, with several gauges
already over 2". Otherwise, the forecast has been very good so
far. With roughly another 1-2" expected over the next 48 hours,
there are still no major flooding concerns expected this weekend.
That being said, the rain combined with a cold wind will not make
for great picnic weather.

Strong SW winds will increase through the day ahead of the
frontal passage tonight. Gusts to gale force are expected,
especially as the frontal boundary moves through in the afternoon
and early evening. After the front passes, winds will shift to
westerly, but remain strong through the night. A wind advisory is
in effect for the majority of the area from noon today through 10
AM Sunday.

.LONG TERM...
(Saturday through Thursday)
Issued at 112 AM PST Fri Mar 1 2024

Saturday will feel like the Pacific Northwest. In addition to
periods of rain, it`s going to start cold and won`t warm up very
much. The official forecast for San Francisco has a low of 46F
with the high only reaching 53F. While that`s nowhere near the
daily record (lowest max temp) of 45F set in 1896, it`s 9 degrees
below normal and more in line with the average March high temp in
Seattle (54F). The majority of the rainfall looks to be in the
morning, with only scattered showers in the afternoon. Winds will
also be lighter than Friday, but there will still be a stiff
westerly breeze through the day, especially along the Central
Coast. The first real snow of the year is expected in the
mountains as the thickness finally drops low enough during the
tail end of the multiday rain event. There`s some instability,
but the air mass will be drying out in the post-front environment.
The 06Z NAM point sounding for Santa Rosa valid at 10AM Saturday
brings the freezing level to 1465` with 142 J/kg of CAPE. The
problem is the precipitable water is only 0.38" at that time, and
continuing to decrease through the day. A few inches are expected
in the higher peaks of the Mayacamas and Santa Lucias, around an
inch in the Diablo Range, and a possible dusting in the Santa Cruz
Mountains. To be clear, the snow levels will remain above 2,000
ft and will not impact the main mountain passes.

The rain will really taper off Sunday, but the cold temperatures
will linger through the week. Monday morning looks to bring the
coldest temperatures with most areas dropping into the mid to
upper 30s before the sun comes up. The remainder of the week will
have lows in the upper 30s to mid 40s and highs in the upper 50s.
Some light rain is possible mid week. The uncertainty is much
higher than normal beyond Thursday with the global models all over
the place by next weekend.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 402 AM PST Fri Mar 1 2024

Rain showers will continue through the day today, with rain at times
reducing visibilities to MVFR conditions, alongside low clouds and
CIGS as showers pass through the region. As scattered showers pass
through, CIGs are likely to oscillate between VFR and MVFR. Showers
will be more scattered and light to moderate in nature during the
daytime today, but become more widespread and moderate to heavy at
times towards the night. In heavy rain showers, IFR conditions are
possible as visibilities lower. Winds will be strong and gusty out
of the S/SW through much of the day. Gusts upwards of 35 knots at
select terminals are expected, with gusts generally 25-30 knots
expected at most. Confidence on wind strength is high. The period
of strongest winds are anticipated to be in the late evening
tonight as the heaviest rain showers begin to impact the area.
LLWS will likely be present at KSTS, KLVK, and KSNS terminals as
the strongest winds and rain begin tonight, and a front passes. It
is not until the very end of the TAF period that gusts are
expected to begin easing. Even then, winds will be W/SW and still
elevated at around 15 knots generally. Rain begins to lighten near
this time as well.


Vicinity of SFO...MVFR through much of the TAF period, with only
brief breaks to VFR. IFR conditions are possible in heavier rain
late tonight as visibilities drop, though have not included in
the TAF at this time due to uncertainty of timing of IFR
conditions. Rain and strong winds will be present through the vast
majority of the TAF period. Strong and gusty winds out of the
S/SW expected, with gusts around 25 knots beginning in the morning
of Friday. Gusts will increase to just shy of 40 knots into the
evening of Friday as heavier rain approaches. In the mid morning
of Saturday, rain will lighten and eventually become more
scattered, and strong gusts will slowly ease.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...Current MVFR conditions improve briefly to
VFR late Friday morning as scattered showers and associated low
CIGs dissipate, and visibilities improve. However, confidence on
maintaining VFR beyond noon is low-moderate. Passing showers today
may at times reduce conditions back to MVFR. Winds increase this
morning out of the SW to become gusty by the late morning.
Strongest gusts will be around 30 knots in the evening. Moderate
to heavy rainfall and MVFR conditions return into the evening as
well. Rain is not expected to end until beyond the current TAF
period. LLWS at KSNS as the strongest winds and rain approach this
evening.

.MARINE...
(Today through Wednesday)
Issued at 402 AM PST Fri Mar 1 2024

Shower activity continues through the day today, with rain
becoming more widespread and heavier into the night tonight. South
to southwest winds will increase in strength throughout the day,
reaching gale force by the afternoon, and lasting into the early
morning of Saturday. Conditions over the waters will be hazardous
and gale warnings have been issued. Winds later ease to become
fresh to strong during the day Saturday out of the west. Come the
beginning of the next work week, conditions begin to dry out and
winds become gentle to moderate out of the northwest. Rough to
high northwest swell enters the waters today and lasts through the
weekend.
