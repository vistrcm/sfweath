.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 149 AM PST Mon Jan 8 2024

Cold conditions continue through this morning with Frost Advisories
and Freeze Warnings in effect. Unsettled weather and cool conditions
return Tuesday and continue into the next weekend.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 149 AM PST Mon Jan 8 2024

A cold start to the morning with temperatures away from the immediate
coastline dropping into the mid/upper 20s to mid 30s with
frost/freeze headlines posted until 10 AM PST. Otherwise, this
afternoon temperatures will struggle to warm out of the mid/upper
50s (mid 40s in the higher peaks). Clouds will increase from the
north throughout the day as a weak weather system approaches.

As such, warmer conditions are expected across the North Bay and
greater Bay Area tonight. A Frost Advisory in now in effect for
interior Monterey and San Benito counties Tuesday morning as
temperatures are expected to cool into the upper 20s in the highest
peaks to mid 30s elsewhere.

.LONG TERM...
(Tuesday through Sunday)
Issued at 149 AM PST Mon Jan 8 2024

Unsettled conditions return Tuesday and Wednesday, mainly impacting
the coastal ranges as another frontal system sweeps across the
region. Rainfall amounts will be greatest in the coastal ranges with
up to 0.40" in the coastal ranges, generally 0.20" or less in the
City and North Bay Valleys, and 0.15" or less elsewhere. Interior
Monterey and San Benito counties may only see trace amounts
throughout Tuesday and Wednesday.

Thursday will be mostly dry with temperatures in the mid/upper 50s
(40s in the region`s higher elevations). The biggest forecast
concern remains the potential for a more significant rain event
towards the end of the week. European and American ensemble models
agree that an upper level trough will come through western North
America and set up in the Midwest by the weekend. That`s around
where the similarities end. European ensembles show the bulk of the
precipitation heading for California, but the American ensembles
focus more on the Pacific Northwest. This forecast will be refined
as we go through the week.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 334 AM PST Mon Jan 8 2024

Quiet weather with VFR conditions and light winds through the
morning. Surface high pressure over the E Pacific will approach
the coast today and some moisture will funnel in anticyclonicly
around its northeastern periphery. This will result in a small
chance for MVFR cigs between 21z-00z today, but confidence is low.
The better chance for MVFR cig development will be late tonight
into early Tuesday morning as a weak frontal boundary approaches
the region. This frontal boundary will bring -DZ towards the end
of the TAF period. For winds today, they will be fairly benign
with light sea breeze kicking in this afternoon.

Vicnity of SFO...Light winds and VFR conditions. Light sea breeze
expected this afternoon. Low confidence in MVFR cig development
this afternoon but there is a small chance (515-528-529.

     Freeze Warning until 10 AM PST this morning for CAZ516>518.

     Frost Advisory from 1 AM to 10 AM PST Tuesday for CAZ516-518.

PZ...Small Craft Advisory until 9 AM PST this morning for Pigeon Pt
     to Pt Pinos 0-10 nm-Pigeon Pt to Pt Pinos 10-60 NM-Pt Arena
     to Pt Reyes 0-10 nm-Pt Arena to Pt Reyes 10-60 NM-Pt Pinos
     to Pt Piedras Blancas 0-10 nm-Pt Reyes to Pigeon Pt 0-10 nm.

     Small Craft Advisory from 9 AM to 3 PM PST Tuesday for Pt Arena
     to Pt Reyes 10-60 NM.
