...New AVIATION...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 153 PM PDT Wed Aug 2 2023

Night and morning clouds clearing to the coast each afternoon will
continue. High pressure nudges closer to our region late week
with above average temperatures expected by the weekend away from
the coast. A gradual cooling trend develops early next week.

&&

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 125 AM PDT Thu Aug 3 2023

An expansive high pressure ridge was centered over the southern
Great Plains early this morning with shortwave impulses trekking
through the Intermountain West, Central Plains, and mid Mississippi
Valley. With ridging expanding towards the Pacific Northwest some
compression of the marine layer has occurred locally, with a depth
between approximately 1100 and 1600 ft per area profilers. Inland
cloud penetration is less compared to 24 hours ago with no
widespread reports of drizzle so far.

Expect this pattern to persist as we remain along the northwest
periphery of the upper ridge. This will maintain breezy onshore
winds this afternoon and evening along with a gradual erosion of
cloud cover towards the coast. This evolution may be a little
quicker as compared to yesterday given the shallower marine
layer, with some of the cloudier spots yesterday afternoon perhaps
seeing a little better shot of at least a few hours of filtered
sun. Temperatures should be quite similar to yesterday, with
coastal/bayside areas in the 60s and 70s this afternoon, and the
typically hotter inland valleys climbing into the 80s to around
90. All-in-all not too hot for this time of year. Overnight lows
will dip into the 50s for most of the region with even the higher
elevations dropping into the 50s and 60s. Low clouds will once
again blanket coastal and bayside areas overnight along with the
favored near-coastal valleys.

.LONG TERM...
(Friday through Wednesday)
Issued at 125 AM PDT Thu Aug 3 2023

The upper high pressure area will build towards SoCal and northern
Baja over the weekend. However this will happen concurrent to the
upper westerlies driving several low amplitude disturbances through
NorCal and the Great Basin. No weather impacts are expected, but
this will temper warming locally as the ridge struggles to gain
full control. That`s not to say the weekend won`t be warm. In fact
inland readings should climb well into the 90s to lower 100s.
This will produce a moderate HeatRisk for these areas where heat
safety should be practiced. However it will be a different story
for coastal and bayside locations. While the ridge should
successfully compress the marine layer (meaning less clouds and
the cooler marine air hanging out a bit closer to the coast), it
will fail to snuff it out completely. Therefore cool ocean breezes
should keep temperatures largely in the 70 to 80 degree range for
these spots, excluding the typically warmer portions of the East
and South Bays. So while a warming trend is on tap for inland
areas this weekend the pattern doesn`t favor long lived or overly
excessive heat. Looking forward, a weakness develops in the upper
ridge by early to mid next week and this will favor gradually
cooling temperatures for the remainder of the extended period.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 438 AM PDT Thu Aug 3 2023

Satellite shows stratus has pushed inland towards most of the
terminals with the exception of KSJC, creating a mix of VFR, MVFR,
IFR, and LIFR ceilings. Low confidence that LIFR ceilings will
continue in the North bay up till 17Z, where lifting is expected,
but models were unable to capture LIFR ceilings for KSTS this
morning but observations shows low ceilings over the terminal.
Therefore, will continue to monitor for any necessary amendments.
The marine layer has deepened creating some fluctuations with
ceiling heights between MVFR and IFR for most terminals with unusual
clearing times but for now, expect lifting between 17-20Z, with some
terminals possibly experiencing VFR later in the afternoon today.
TEMPOs were placed within the TAFs to accommodate for some
uncertainty of ceiling heights. Expect MVFR/IFR conditions to return
this evening/night. Onshore winds are moderate and will become
breezy and gusty through the coastal gaps and valleys in the
afternoon.

Vicinity of SFO...IFR ceilings. Satellite shows stratus pretty
socked in. Therefore, expect a later than usual clearing time near
20Z. Possible chance that SFO may temporarily see VFR for a few
hours, with a quick return of MVFR ceilings this afternoon followed
by IFR ceilings tonight. Onshore winds are expected to become gusty
throughout the day and remaining breezy for most of the TAF period.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...MVFR. The terminals is expected to have
temporary moments of VFR, therefore TEMPO groups were placed in KMRY
with a prevailing lifting for KSNS near 19Z. Expect stratus to
return this afternoon/evening to IFR/MVFR ceilings. Winds will
remain moderate with KSNS experiencing breezy winds due to the
Salinas Valley.

.MARINE...
(Tonight through next Monday)
Issued at 847 PM PDT Wed Aug 2 2023

Expect northwesterly winds to continue to generate short period
northwesterly wind waves. The predominant northwest wind wave with
periods of around 7 seconds coupled with a longer period
southerly swell will continue through the remainder of the week.
