...New UPDATE...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 345 AM PDT Fri Sep 13 2024

Cooler than normal temperatures persist through the majority of
the forecast period. Rain chances and gusty winds arrive late
Sunday to early Monday. Another chance for wet weather exists in
the midweek.

&&

.UPDATE...
Issued at 835 AM PDT Fri Sep 13 2024

Patchy stratus persists at the coast, particularly between Point
Reyes and Pigeon Point and areas around Monterey Bay. Confidence
in the depth of the upper level trough Sunday and Monday is
increasing as the ensemble models have moved towards the
deterministic solutions over the last day. Otherwise, the forecast
remains on track with no updates at this time.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 345 AM PDT Fri Sep 13 2024

Its a quiet night with nothing in the way of stratus to
be found along the Sonoma to Monterey coastline. Skies are clear,
and the night is cool with temperatures currently sitting in the low
to mid 50s for most locations. A few higher elevations are seeing
temps in the 40s currently. These cool nights, and comfortable days
are expected to last through much of the forecast period as low
pressure continues to dominate the pattern. In fact, with highs only
in the upper 80s, maybe a few low 90s, for interior regions, and 70s
closer to the bay, these temperatures today and tomorrow are running
just a few degrees below normal, if not near normal. However,
temperatures are likely to grow a bit cooler as we head into the
extended, with troughing continuing to dominate the pattern.

&&

.LONG TERM...
(Saturday through Thursday)
Issued at 345 AM PDT Fri Sep 13 2024

As troughing continues, a potent low pressure system (for
September, that is) is expected to enter the region Sunday with
temperatures continuing to drop. Highs for Sunday and Monday for
interior regions will likely feel significantly cooler than those on
Saturday, as highs will only be in the 70s. Closer to the bays,
highs will be in the 60s. Upper 50s are expected at the coastline.
These temperatures will generally be about 10 degrees cooler than
normal.

However, cooler temperatures is not all. The bigger story is
arguably the chance for rain! Though, don`t get too excited yet.
This is not going to be a super-soaker event. Most locations will
only see a few hundredths of an inch of rain, with the wettest
locations seeing at most about a tenth of an inch. So while yes,
rain will likely be falling, it is not going to be much. Perhaps
just enough to make obvious that layer of dust on your car, but not
wash it off, and force you to have to take it to the car wash.

So why not that much rainfall? Well, part of it has to do with the
fact that this system just isn`t carrying all that much moisture,
especially compared to the mean amount for this particular date in
September per KOAK sounding climatology. The mean precipitable
water (PWAT) amount for this date is 0.72", and multiple model
soundings seem to suggest a max PWAT Sunday of around 0.8". If
you`re curious, the median PWAT value for this date is 0.70", and
the 75th percentile is at 0.84". So really, we`re just not looking
at a super wet system. Is it carrying a bit more moisture than
normal? Sure. But it just isn`t up to snuff for a widespread,
complete washout type of event. But, nonetheless, it`ll be a nice
change of pace and a break from just blue skies and sunshine!

Current timing places the first chances of rain arriving in the
North Bay very late Sunday night, perhaps even the earliest hours of
Monday morning, with the Monterey Bay region seeing their first
chances more towards sunrise on Monday. There is still uncertainty
as to the time of arrival for the rain, but this is a rough ballpark
estimate.

Aside from the rain, the last piece of this system we need to talk
about is winds. Northwesterly winds will strengthen Sunday afternoon
and evening ahead of the cold front, with gusts in lower elevations
reaching to around 20-25mph, and closer to 35-45mph in higher
elevations. Early Monday morning, after the frontal passage, winds
begin to decrease and settle. No wind products have been issued at
this time, though this will be something we keep our eyes on closely
over the next few forecast issuances.

Beyond the Sunday/Monday system, another chance of rain exists in
the midweek. For now, details on this are still a bit fuzzy.

That`s all for now folks. Stay tuned to the forecast for updates,
and enjoy your Friday!

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 455 AM PDT Fri Sep 13 2024

Small patches of marine stratus lingering along coastal areas
this morning. The majority of terminals are expected to see VFR
persist through the TAF period, however, Monterey Bay is likely to
see the sporadic impacts of low CIGs from stratus this morning.
Otherwise, light winds this morning expected to become breezy and
onshore generally out of the W/NW this afternoon.

Vicinity of SFO...VFR through the TAF period. Winds steadily
increase through the late morning and early afternoon to become
moderate and W/NW this afternoon. Low confidence in CIGs overnight
tonight into Saturday morning.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...Patchy IFR/LIFR this morning along the
coastal areas, though mostly VFR. Onshore winds increase this
afternoon 8-10 kts. Higher confidence in stratus return this
evening.

.MARINE...
(Today through Wednesday)
Issued at 345 AM PDT Fri Sep 13 2024

Strong NW winds continue through the weekend, bringing hazardous
conditions for small craft. As troughing continues, and a more
potent low pressure system approaches the region Sunday, chances
for light rain will begin.
