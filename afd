.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 1250 AM PST Tue Feb 11 2025
Cloudiness increases today as a low pressure system approaches
the region, bringing some initial rain tonight into Wednesday
morning. A more vigorous system Wednesday night through Thursday
brings higher chances for flooding and damaging winds.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 1250 AM PST Tue Feb 11 2025

Satellite imagery shows mainly clear skies through the region, with
some patchy stratus across the immediate coast. The day should start
off clear and dry across the region, with one more day of chilly
morning temperatures dropping into the lower to mid 30s in the
interior valleys, with readings in the mid to upper 20s possible in
southern Monterey County, and lows in the upper 30s to lower 40s
along the coast. A Freeze Warning is now in effect for the southern
Salinas Valley and the mountains of interior Monterey and San Benito
Counties, with a Frost Advisory in place elsewhere across the inland
North Bay, East Bay, South Bay and Central Coast. Both of these
products persist through 9 AM today.

As an offshore low pressure system develops, approaches the coast,
and drags a shot of subtropical moisture along with it, mid- to high
level cloud cover will increase through the afternoon and evening
hours. A first shot of rain will arrive tonight, a pretty
progressive system focusing most of its moisture to the south of the
Golden Gate and especially across the Central Coast. Rainfall
amounts from this first system will be relatively limited, with up
to an inch of rain possible in favored locations along the Santa
Cruz and Santa Lucia mountains, while the lowland Central Coast, the
western San Mateo Peninsula, and the higher elevations of Santa
Clara County see anywhere between a quarter and half an inch of
rain, with the rain chances diminishing to the north of the Marin
coastal ranges.

Light to breezy onshore winds develop through the afternoon before
diminishing in the evening hours and turning more southerly late
tonight as the low pressure system approaches. Today`s high
temperatures range from the mid to upper 50s in the inland valleys,
to the lower 50s closer to the coast, and into the middle to upper
40s across the higher elevations.

.LONG TERM...
(Tuesday night through next Sunday)
Issued at 1250 AM PST Tue Feb 11 2025

Long term forecast thinking remains unchanged. The previous
discussion follows for reference:

First round of rainfall continues early Wednesday morning for areas
south of the Bay, and largely clearing out by mid-to-late morning.
Wednesday afternoon actually has the potential to be mostly dry as
shortwave ridging moves over the region and essentially cuts off our
large scale vertical motion. By Wednesday night, a vigorous
shortwave trough rapidly deepens along with the associated surface
low approaching the CA/OR border. This more intense lift will aid in
advecting the moisture into what would be a more coherent
"atmospheric river" type pattern, whereas the first round of
rainfall Tuesday/Wednesday is a more localized moisture plume,
though not completely detached, and a much weaker degree of upper
level support. So, the Tuesday/Wednesday system currently lacks the
punch and will serve as a precursor event. Then, there is high
confidence that the Wednesday/Thursday system will be the more
impactful given the generous model agreement in robust jet support,
not only supporting heavy rainfall, but also potentially damaging
winds. Let`s juts say that when my SO told me her flight was
Thursday morning out of Monterey, I said, "oh...uhh...gonna be
bumpy!" Given the current location of the moisture axis and
dynamic features, this system will generally favor areas from
about San Francisco southward across the Central Coast. Overall
good news in terms of annual rainfall since southern areas are a
bit behind the curve so far this water year (since Oct 1). An
interesting tidbit to include; the Central Coast watershed which
runs along the coast roughly from Monterey to Arroyo Grande is
about 4.37" below normal for the water year to date. The current
forecast for that watershed by the end of the week is about 3-6".
There is a slight chance (at least 15%) of rainfall rates
resulting in flash flooding conditions area-wide on Thursday. It
is likely that there will be more of a focus as the event nears
and more information about convective rainfall rates becomes clear
from high res guidance. The system does appear to be rather
progressive and should move through the region relatively quickly,
thus hindering any increase in the probability of flash flooding
for now. Guidance keeps this vigorous wave open and embedded in
the flow, so there is relatively low stall potential. As far as
rainfall totals go, the North Bay will still see respectable
totals in the 2-4" range, the greater Bay Area will see a range of
1.5-3" (less in the rainshadowed South Bay, more along the
peninsula), 4-6" and locally up to 8" in the Santa Cruz Mtns, 2-3"
across the Central Coast counties, and 3-6" along the Big Sur
Coast, locally up to 8". A bit about the winds; guidance is
showing reasonable agreement in the placement and strength of the
associated surface low, ultimately bringing it into the CA coast
near Cape Mendocino and a minimum surface pressure of about
985-991 mb. This would likely result in Wind Advisory criteria
being met across a wide swath of the region should guidance begin
to converge on the lower end of that range. Current best forecast
is for gusty winds 40-45 mph along the coast and ridgetops of
coastal ranges. There is also a slight risk for thunderstorms
Thursday afternoon as the cooler air settles in aloft and
instability increases. By Thursday night things should be settling
down with some showers lingering into Friday morning. The weather
into the weekend looks to clear out with another, much weaker,
embedded shortwave trough entering the PNW late Saturday which may
bring more rainfall the the North Bay on Sunday.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 320 AM PST Tue Feb 11 2025

Currently VFR at all terminals with the exception of STS. Expect
cloud decks to lower and winds to increase throughout the day as a
low pressure system encroaches the coast. The best chances for rain
will be for terminals south of the Golden Gate Bridge and along
the immediate coast. VFR is mainly expected although brief
reductions may occur if a heavier rain shower passes over a
terminal.

Vicinity of SFO...Currently VFR with westerly flow. Winds will
prevail out of the west through late Tuesday night.
Easterly/southeasterly winds will prevail by 06Z with the best
chances for rain between 06Z and 10Z.

SFO Bridge Approach... Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...Currently VFR and calm at SNS.
Unfortunately due to a power outage MRY is not reporting, but satellite
shows a patch of stratus to the north of the terminals. Drainage
flow overnight will give way to the sea breeze this afternoon.
Rain and southeasterly winds will commence by 06Z.

.MARINE...
(Today through Sunday)
Issued at 320 AM PST Tue Feb 11 2025

Strong and gusty northerly winds will prevail today. Strong
southerly winds with gale force gusts will prevail Wednesday
afternoon through Friday night. Significant wave heights will
briefly abate today with a considerable building trend slated for
Wednesday through Friday with very rough seas expected. Rainfall
can be expected this afternoon through Friday night with a chance
for thunderstorms Thursday.

&&

.BEACHES...
Issued at 1250 AM PST Tue Feb 11 2025

Westerly swell with a period up to 16 seconds will build through
Friday. As a result, large breaking waves of 20-30 feet are expected
Thursday night through Friday. While too early to issue any
products, it is looking like a High Surf Warning will be warranted
during that time for all Pacific Coast beaches. Please remember to
stay off of jetties, piers, and other waterside infrastructure, keep
pets on a leash and away from the water, and never turn your back on
the ocean!
