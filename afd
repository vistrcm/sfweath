...New AVIATION, MARINE...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 203 AM PDT Tue May 20 2025

Strong and gusty northwesterly winds, above seasonal normal
temperatures, and hazardous marine conditions today. Elevated
fire weather conditions through Thursday.

&&

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 203 AM PDT Tue May 20 2025

Heights will ever so slightly fall today as a subtle upper-level
shortwave trough skirts the region, but temperatures will still
remain seasonably warm. High pressure over the Eastern Pacific
Ocean and low pressure over the Desert Southwest will support a
tight surface pressure gradient that will be conducive for
northwesterly flow that will be locally strong over the waters,
along the coastline, and through northwest/southeast oriented
valleys such as the Salinas and Santa Clara. The return of onshore
flow has allowed for cooler and moister conditions and
subsequently the reformation of the marine layer, albeit an
interesting looking one as offshore/downslope flow in the higher
terrain of the North Bay and Santa Cruz Mountains is resulting in
compressional warming that`s effectively wiping out the marine
layer in those spots. Elevated fire weather conditions will be
prevalent, primarily across the brush and grasses of the interior,
through Thursday as dry and gusty conditions continue.

.LONG TERM...
(Wednesday through Monday)
Issued at 203 AM PDT Tue May 20 2025

A low amplitude upper-level shortwave ridge will nudge into the
region Wednesday, bringing the warmest conditions of the week with
temperatures of 10 degrees above normal. Global ensemble clusters
are all in agreement of heights falling through Friday due to an
upper-level shortwave trough, which will translate to
temperatures returning to seasonal normals by Friday as the brief,
gradual cooling trend brings temperatures down by 5 degrees each
day. Agreement in global ensemble clusters continues with heights
rebuilding Saturday as an upper-level shortwave ridge builds into
the West, kicking off another brief, gradual warming trend.
Oakland Museum (OAMC1) and San Francisco Downtown (SFOC1) will put
their daily minimum temperature records in jeopardy this week.
Oakland Museum (OAMC1): Wednesday (5/21), Saturday (5/24), Sunday
(5/25), and Monday (5/26), previous records of 49, 49, 49, and 50
degrees respectively set in 1986, 2011, 1980, and 2008
respectively, the official forecast is 51, 51, 51, and 53 degrees
respectively. San Francisco Downtown (SFOC1) on Friday (5/23) and
Sunday (5/25), previous records of 47 degrees set in 2010 and 1953
respectively, the official forecast is 50 degrees.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 440 AM PDT Tue May 20 2025

VFR is expected to prevail for all terminals from late this
morning and through the evening hours. IFR/MVFR ceilings over the
Monterey Bay terminals are expected to lift by 18z this morning.
Breezy NW/W winds will develop this afternoon for the coastal
terminals, easing after sunset.

Vicinity of SFO...Low marine stratus lingers in the vicinity of
KSFO and KOAK early this morning but is anchored to the immediate
coastline and is not expected to impact the terminals directly.
Breezy onshore winds this afternoon will ease after sunset. Low
level marine stratus is expected to me more widespread late in the
TAF period into the morning hours of Wednesday.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...LIFR/IFR cigs have been steady overnight
and are expected to lift by 17-18z this morning. Breezy onshore
winds between 10-20 knots can be expected this afternoon, easing
after sunset. HiRes guidance indicates that IFR/LIFR marine
stratus is likely to develop after midnight and persist through
mid-morning Wednesday.

.MARINE...
(Today through Sunday)
Issued at 440 AM PDT Tue May 20 2025

Widespread strong northerly breezes with gale force gusts are
expected over the inner and outer waters today. Hazardous marine
conditions will persist through Thursday with strong northwesterly
breezes with gale force gusts and rough to very rough seas.
