.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 328 AM PDT Sun Sep 17 2023

An area of low pressure off the coast will keep extensive low
clouds across the region, especially night and morning hours with
daytime highs running near to below normal at least through
Wednesday. A low dropping from the north will keep temperatures
near normal with more sunshine Thursday and Friday. Warming trend
for next weekend as the low pushes eastward allowing high pressure
to rebuild.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 355 AM PDT Sun Sep 17 2023

Mild morning temperatures observed again with readings varying from
the mid 50s to mid 60s. Satellite shows areas of increasing stratus
clouds and the marine layer remains at least moderately deep. Sea
surface temperatures 56F to 62F vary from near neutral to +2F to +3F
above September normals; cloud cover and mild sea surface temps are
sustaining mild overnight lows. Precipitable water (pw) on Saturday
evening`s Oakland upper air sounding remained elevated, close to the
90th percentile for mid September, the pw was 1.08". With a slowly
moving 500 mb level 576 decameter height low 300 miles west of the
Bay Area and counter-clockwise winds around the low, little if any
lowering in the pw is forecast today and tonight. Additional to the
cloud cover and sea surface temps, extra water vapor per Oakland
upper air pw is also slowing outgoing nocturnal radiational cooling
to space.

Lower level cool air advection associated with the aforementioned
500 mb low offshore is still arriving this morning, however by late
morning the NAM forecasts this to abruptly end, then followed by
another couple degrees Celsius cooling tonight. Little change is
likely in the marine layer depth today and tonight. Daytime highs
are forecast below normal today due to a combination of stratus
clouds, residual cool air advection and onshore winds. Daytime
highs today mainly 60s to lower 70s coastside, 70s bayside and
near 80 to lower 80s far inland. Lows tonight in 50s to near 60,
stratus clouds redeveloping and moving inland on onshore breezes.

Patchy light measurable coastal drizzle this morning, similarly light
drizzle may redevelop tonight.

.LONG TERM...
(Monday through Saturday)
Issued at 355 AM PDT Sun Sep 17 2023

Not much change in daily highs and lows forecast through early to
mid week. The mid to late week evolution of the synoptic pattern
brings a greater mid-latitude and continental influence and drying
per lowering tropospheric pw to at or below late September normal
and modified cooler air from higher latitudes. There`s still good
global model agreement (within 120 hours) regarding the eastern
Pacific 500 mb ridge and eventual deepening downstream 500 mb
trough drawing in and merging with the 500 mb low currently off
our coastline. Polar jet stream winds cresting over the "unstable
ridge" can`t adhere to the sharp anti-cyclonic curvature ultimately
carving out and driving southward a closed 500 mb low that`ll reach
northern CA/NV later Wednesday. The ECMWF and GFS forecast lowering
surface pressures beginning later Tuesday and lasting into Thursday
over our forecast area; a good idea to monitor northerly surface
pressure gradients and winds in case the development is stronger
than currently forecast. Current model output show a mix of solutions
in the vicinity of 925 mb level (2500 feet) winds, GFS shows stronger
northerly gusts upwards 30 knots nearing the North Bay, however the
ECMWF is much weaker with winds, i.e. low confidence forecast as
it is now. With surface low pressure over the Great Basin, the larger
scale SFO-WMC (onshore) pressure gradient will otherwise prevail.

Strengthening subtropical jet stream winds at the base of the closed
500 mb low will eject the low eastward by late week and weekend. The
eastern Pacific 500 mb ridge will weaken and meanwhile later this
week zonal polar jet stream winds will strengthen across the southern
Aleutian Islands setting up for a potentially rapidly deepening low
pressure system over the eastern Pacific and southern Gulf of Alaska.
Late September continental surface heating coupling to redeveloping
500 mb shortwave ridging over the western states may successfully put
the brakes on the forward motion of the next low pressure system,
will be interesting to monitor model guidance on this given backdrop
of still a fairly large northern hemisphere dynamic rotation rate of
long wave troughs. September climatology is typically dry across our
cwa, it`d be early for measurable rain.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 428 AM PDT Sun Sep 17 2023

Widespread MVFR stratus across the region, expected to continue
expanding through what`s left of the night. Main region of
uncertainty is around SFO and OAK, where gaps in the stratus have
occasionally cleared both terminals over the last few hours. Inland
clearing is expected sometime this afternoon, with the coastal areas
remaining under MVFR ceilings through the TAF period. Breezy onshore
winds this afternoon, with peak winds at 10-15 knots at the
terminals. Stratus returns this evening, though there is some
uncertainty in the return times with model guidance suggesting a
later return of stratus than the persistence forecast, the latter of
which is reflected in the TAFs.

Vicinity of SFO... Moderate confidence for MVFR ceilings through
around 20-21Z. Main source of uncertainty is a hole in the stratus
layer that has set up close to the terminals at SFO and OAK. Breezy
but relatively light westerly winds on Sunday afternoon with speeds
up to 10-15 knots. Stratus returns to the terminal early Sunday
evening with moderate confidence in timing. Some model output is
showing that the terminal could clear before the end of the TAF
period, although confidence is too low at this time to reflect this
in the TAFs.

SFO Bridge Approach... Stratus developing this evening may impact
the approach path before it impacts the terminal. Otherwise, similar
to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals... High confidence in MVFR ceilings at
MRY and the immediate coast through the TAF period. If, by some
miracle, any clearing occurs, expect it to be relatively brief. At
SNS and across the inland regions, MVFR stratus persists into the
afternoon. Breezy onshore flow develops this afternoon with speeds
up to 12 knots, with stratus returning to SNS in the evening as
winds diminish, although confidence on the exact timing is moderate.

&&

.MARINE...
Issued at 236 AM PDT Sun Sep 17 2023

Expect light to moderate breezes across the coastal waters through
early Monday. Fresh to strong northerly winds and rough seas will
begin to build in the northern zones Tuesday through Thursday.
Light southerly swell and moderate northwesterly swell continue
through the weekend, with a longer period swell arriving in the
next week.
