...New SYNOPSIS, SHORT TERM, LONG TERM, AVIATION, MARINE...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 317 AM PDT Thu Aug 15 2024

Temperatures at or just below normal continue through this weekend,
as well as breezy onshore flow and a fairly pleasant pattern.
Slight warm up slated for the middle of next week.

&&

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 317 AM PDT Thu Aug 15 2024

Deja Vu for most today as the marine layer is compressed again
this morning. High temps today largely the same as yesterday,
maybe a few degrees cooler in the warmest locations. Really not
much else to mention in the short term. Gusty NW onshore winds
once again during the afternoon along gaps and passes.

&&

.LONG TERM...
(Friday through Wednesday)
Issued at 317 AM PDT Thu Aug 15 2024

Once again, little change in the longer term forecast. Cluster
analysis exhibits high confidence in a deep, persistent trough
pattern off the coast of the PNW through this weekend and early
next week, which would promote onshore flow and a deeper marine
layer. Drizzle can be expected along the coastal areas Friday
night/Saturday morning. The gusty afternoon winds look to diminish
after the weekend as the trough begins to gradually break down.
500 mb height rises begin by mid-week amid the weakening trough,
leading to a subtle warming trend through the middle of next week.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 317 AM PDT Thu Aug 15 2024

VFR through the TAF period for the majority of terminals, the
exception being Monterey Bay. This morning, stratus just off the
coast has struggled to make any meaningful push inland. Therefore
expecting clear conditions to last, with moderate W/NW winds
returning in the afternoon. A few gusts reaching towards 20 knots
are not out of the question today. Any gusts are expected to
diminish into the late night tonight. Although stratus will form off
the coast, very low confidence in any stratus advecting inland.

Vicinity of SFO...VFR through the TAF period. Moderate NW winds in
the afternoon tomorrow are likely to gust into the 30 knot range,
though gusts will diminish into the late night. Winds are likely to
remain somewhat elevated in the overnight hours from Thursday to
Friday, with winds generally staying around 10 knots and above.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...Stratus has made multiple attempts to reach
the terminal this morning, though continues to fail to do so. Models
continue to show stratus should bring low CIGs to KMRY, though thus
far, model guidance has not proven to be correct. Satellite shows
stratus again trying to reach into KMRY terminal. Given model
guidance and current satellite imagery, as well as temperatures
beginning to drop closer to the point of saturation, have indicated
in the TAF this morning that IFR CIGs should develop at KMRY.
However, confidence on this is low at this point. Whether stratus
develops this morning or not, expect VFR from at the very least 15Z
onwards, with breezy NW winds in the afternoon. Stratus does not
begin to return until the end of the TAF period, and confidence on
CIG formation is low.

.MARINE...
(Today through Tuesday)
Issued at 317 AM PDT Thu Aug 15 2024

Fresh to strong northwest winds continue through the end of the
week. Conditions will be fairly consistent before a brief
decrease in winds Saturday morning. This won`t last long as a weak
cold front moves through and fresh to strong winds return Sunday.
