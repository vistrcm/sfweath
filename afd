National Weather Service San Francisco Bay Area
420 AM PDT Thu May 11 2023

.SYNOPSIS...Today marks the beginning of a warming pattern. Saturday
continues to look to be the warmest day, with slight cooling
expected beyond then, before hints at another possible warmup near
the middle of next week.

.DISCUSSION...as of 03:54 AM PDT Thursday...

SHORT TERM... (Thursday through Friday)

Nighttime satellite imagery shows a deepening coastal stratus deck
infiltrating into the SF bay area, Marin county coastline, and
Monterey region. Temperatures compared to yesterday at this same
time are running about 1 to 2 degrees warmer on average in these
same zones as the stratus helps insulate these areas. Temperatures
currently range from the mid 40s in inland portions, to low to mid
50s along the coastlines and bays. Beyond sunrise, temperatures will
warm to highs in the upper 50s to low 60s along coastlines, with low
to mid 70s in far interior locations such as North Bay and Santa
Clara Valleys. Today marks the beginning of a gradual climb into the
first taste of summer with above normal temperatures expected this
weekend as a ridge of high pressure builds over the region. That
being said, high temperatures for today will still be below normal.

Friday warms a bit more, with far interior locations beginning to
reach into the low to mid 80s.  East Bay hills reach up into the mid
to upper 70s, alongside much of the Santa Clara and San Benito
hills. Immediate coastlines and bay shorelines remain cool in the
mid 60s under the influence of robust coastal stratus.

Winds look to remain predominantly light, with slight increases in
speed in the afternoons, becoming westerly.

LONG TERM... (Saturday through Tuesday)

With Saturday continuing to look to be the hottest day of this
warming trend, just how warm will it get? Let`s take a look at some
probabilities of temperatures throughout the region. San Jose
airport has a forecasted temperature of 87, but what is the current
chance it could exceed 90? Around 1%. Let`s move north and look at
Santa Rosa airport. The forecasted high is 90 degrees on Saturday.
What are the chances of exceeding this? Around a 71% chance. One
last location, Concord, CA has a forecasted high of 90 degrees as
well. What are the chances of exceeding this? Around 68%. A fun
little experiment with probabilities. Though, probabilities of
exceeding 90 degrees aside, it is going to warm up these next few
days. The most important thing is to take into consideration the
moderate heat risk for interior locations such as East Bay hills,
North Bay Valleys, Santa Clara Valley, and the Salinas Valley.
Elsewhere there are minor heat risks. Be sure to increase your
intake of water and hydrating drinks, take breaks in the shade if
working outdoors, check on more sensitive populations such as
elderly people, and never leave pets or children inside of locked
vehicles. If heading to ocean, lakes, or rivers to cool down, wear a
life vest, never turn your back on the ocean, and check for any
beach statements or warnings.

Although this is not any sort of record breaking heatwave,
temperatures will be around ten degrees above normal. Therefore, it
is important to prepare for the warmth and take any necessary
precautions, such as those mentioned above, to ensure yourself and
others stay safe.

Starting Sunday, a backtracking low pressure system moving west
towards the Pacific ocean begins to cut away at the ridge, helping
decrease temperatures slightly Sunday into Tuesday. Beyond this
are hints at another warming trend in the middle of to late next
week, though details are yet to come.
