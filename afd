...New UPDATE, MARINE...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 257 AM PST Mon Jan 20 2025

Frost/Freeze products are in place until 9AM for much of the Bay
Area and Central Coast. Offshore winds will begin to increase this
morning, with the strongest winds being found over the North Bay. A
Wind Advisory goes into effect at 4AM and expires at 1AM Tuesday.
Dry weather persists through the week, with a slight warming trend
Tuesday-Friday.

.UPDATE...
Issued at 851 AM PST Mon Jan 20 2025

Temperatures for most sites have risen above Frost/Freeze criteria
so the Frost Advisory and Freeze Warning will both be allowed to
expire at 9 AM. Gusty winds have started over the North Bay
Mountains as of early this morning. Mt. St. Helena continues to be
the reigning champion for highest wind gusts (of this event) with a
peak gust of 64 mph reported at 8:10 AM. Winds are expected to
continue strengthening during the day with ops closely monitoring
the North Bay Valleys and East Bay Hills in the case that additional
Wind Advisories need to be issued. Otherwise, no major changes to
the forecast.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 257 AM PST Mon Jan 20 2025

Another fascinating night of satellite imagery showing fog and
stratus both scouring out and yet advancing. Observations across
the area clearly depict offshore flow kicking up, which is where you
can see the stratus and fog being purged. In the valleys, where
winds either remain light or are non existent fog and stratus still
exist. In fact, at the time of this AFD fog and stratus are snaking
up the Salinas Valley and creeping out towards Monterey Bay. This
makes for yet another tricky forecast this morning. If the winds
come online so to speak and continue the purging of the stratus and
fog within the next couple of hours, temperatures will still have
enough time to plummet. If the winds take longer to manifest, the
temperature forecast will bust and be too warm. Given we`ve started
to see the signal for winds, opted to keep the Frost/Freeze products
in place this morning. Should this change, these products will need
to be cancelled early.

Now that temperatures are out of the way, back to winds. As noted,
the offshore wind event has begun. Current observations show north
to northeast winds across the higher the North Bay mountains, with
some sites in the East Bay seeing these winds too. Sites such as Mt
St Helena are already gusting to 42 to 47 mph, where as other ridges
along Napa and Sonoma have gusts ranging from 25 to 40 mph. With
that being said, the forecast looks to be on track. Hi-res models
and the pressure gradient ensembles continue to support yield gusts
of 60+ mph for the highest peaks of the North Bay and 40-50 mph for
other peaks. The Wind Advisory for the North Bay Mountains is set to
go in effect at 4AM and run through 1AM Tuesday. Elsewhere, gusty
winds will develop through the remainder of the Bay Area with gusts
between 25 to 35 mph expected over the East Bay Hills, the San
Francisco/San Mateo Peninsula, and within the Santa Cruz Mountains.

.LONG TERM...
(Tuesday through Sunday)
Issued at 257 AM PST Mon Jan 20 2025

The extended forecast has changed little. Offshore winds slacken
Monday night into Tuesday, with high pressure building in during the
day. Dry weather is forecast to persist through much of the week,
with a gradual warming trend being observed during the day.
Overnight, thanks to high pressure in place, we can expect light
winds and clear skies. This means, you guessed it right, more chilly
mornings fore the region and the potential for additional frost
and/or freeze products.

The pattern changes late in the week, as high pressure gets replaced
by upper level troughing. Guidance suggests an upper level low
slides into the west from Canada. At the surface, low pressure is
expected to form, perhaps over northern California. Guidance shows
the possibility for an increase in winds both over land and even
more so over seas. Depending on the placement of this system we
could have offshore flow or a good blast of northerly flow.
Confidence is higher in stronger winds over the waters, which may
lead to high end Small Craft Advisories or Gale Warnings. In
addition to the winds, some ensemble members continue to show the
possibility for light rain showers. The NBM continues to depict this
quite well, splotching PoPs of 10-40% across the Bay Area and
Central Coast. The good news is that, ensembles do show some
moistening, but PWAT values are still quite abysmal. They jump from
0.10" to 0.35", which isn`t much but adds some confidence in light
rain. QPF amounts are generally low, so rain lovers, rejoicing will
need to be put on hold for this event.

Following the trend of where is our rain? Perhaps in the distant
future. Ensembles try to hint at the possibility of rain this coming
weekend as an upper level trough is expected to pass over the
western U.S.. Looking at the ensembles, chances overall look to be
rather slim. The NBM may be too ambitious with the 10-30% it has
speckled over our service area, but it`s not an awful reputation.
This unfortunately doesn`t jive with the CPC 6-10 or 8-14 day
outlook where it advertises below normal chances of precipitation.
The 3-4 week outlook, which puts us in the first half of February
has more positive signal of 50-55% chance of above normal
precipitation for much of our area.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 334 AM PST Mon Jan 20 2025

Currently seeing a mixed bag of LIFR-VFR across the board with fog
and stratus beginning to erode as winds become offshore. High
confidence in VFR through the TAF period once conditions improve
early this morning. Gusty offshore winds are expected through the
day, expect a bumpy ride through the morning as surface winds are
northerly and winds aloft are northeasterly.

Vicinity of SFO...Currently MVFR with southerly flow. Stratus is
starting to erode withing the San Pablo and San Francisco Bays, once
it completely does so VFR is expected through the TAF period.
Southerly winds will back to become northeasterly later this
morning. Winds will diminish and become southerly again tonight,
backing to become easterly by tomorrow morning.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...Currently VFR with southeasterly flow at
MRY and IFR with drainage flow at SNS. Stratus is starting to
retreat towards the Pacific Ocean with high confidence in VFR
through the TAF period at both terminals once it does so completely.
Winds will be ever changing as both terminals will be shielded from
the strongest offshore flow.

.MARINE...
(Today through Saturday)
Issued at 851 AM PST Mon Jan 20 2025

Offshore breezes prevail across the waters through Tuesday with
strong to near gale breezes within the San Pablo and San
Francisco Bays. Moderate seas will persist through Thursday with
significant wave heights becoming rough by Friday. Gale force
winds are expected Friday and into the weekend.

&&

.BEACHES...
Issued at 334 AM PST Mon Jan 20 2025

A Beach Hazards Statement is in effect for all Pacific Coast beaches
through 7 PM as a long period westerly swell is resulting in a
moderate to high risk of sneaker waves and an increased risk of rip
currents. For beachgoers to remain safe it is vital to keep off of
jetties and rocks, keep pets on a leash, observe the ocean for 20
minutes before recreating on the beach or in the ocean, and never
turn your back on the ocean.

Sarment
