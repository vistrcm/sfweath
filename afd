.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 300 AM PDT Thu Jun 29 2023

A robust inland warming trend begins today with hot temperatures
across the interior by Friday and throughout the holiday weekend.
Meanwhile, cooler conditions will prevail near the coast and bays
in response to onshore winds. Temperatures moderate back to near
normal early next week.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 300 AM PDT Thu Jun 29 2023

The mid/upper level trough that resulted in continued below
average temperatures across the region this week is finally
shifting inland. In its wake, high pressure over the eastern
Pacific will build in resulting in a warming trend that will begin
today. As such, the marine layer is compressing with cloud bases
anywhere from 200-1300 ft at this hour. While lowering visibility
and mist are being observed, drizzle this morning is a bit less
widespread as is the inland extent of the stratus overall.

This pattern will allow for quicker dissipation of cloud cover
across inland areas this morning as surface temperatures begin to
warm. Thus, there will be more widespread mid/upper 80s for inland
areas with the far interior reaching into the low 90s this
afternoon. Near the coast, the shallow marine layer is expected to
hold along with onshore flow providing cooler conditions along the
immediate coastline. With the warming air mass aloft and more
compressed marine layer, low clouds will return back to the coast,
around the Monterey Bay and locally inland into the Salinas Valley
overnight with lesser inland intrusion over the North Bay, South Bay
and East Bay. However, onshore flow will allow for modest cooling in
all lower elevations overnight while higher elevations hold in the
60s and 70s.

.LONG TERM...
(Friday through Wednesday)
Issued at 300 AM PDT Thu Jun 29 2023

The warming trend will continue into Friday and
peak on Saturday with 850 mb temperatures approaching or exceeding
25 deg C. This will result in more widespread 90s across the
interior on Friday while cooler conditions will be felt closer to
the bays/coast.  By Saturday, Livermore has a 45% probability of
exceeding 100 deg F with Concord at 30% of doing the same.
Meanwhile, other hot spots such as Lake Berryessa, Pinnacles
National Park and far interior Monterey County have a greater than
70% probability of reaching 100 deg F. With the lack of an offshore
wind component and compressed marine layer, conditions will be cooler
near the coast/bays with mid/upper 50s in places such as Ocean Beach
and Half Moon Bay to lower 80s just a few miles inland. As you head
up in elevation, temperatures will be in the 90s as well each
afternoon with overnight lows only dropping into the 70s if not
lower 80s. The heat across the interior will continue into Sunday
albeit trending downward by a few degrees for most locations. As
such, a Heat Advisory is in effect from Friday afternoon throughout
Sunday afternoon for all interior locations of the Bay Area and
Central Coast. The ridge aloft will begin to weaken and shift
towards the Desert Southwest early next week resulting in
temperatures cooling back to near seasonal averages.

Given this is our first widespread heat event of the season, people
and pets may not be able to acclimate as quickly as expected and may
be more susceptible to heat related illness. A few tips: never leave
pets or people in vehicles, limit outdoor activities during peak
heating of the day, wear sunscreen and light colored clothing, stay
hydrated and take breaks. Lastly, those seeking relief from the heat
heading to the beach - the Pacific Coast can still be a dangerous
place with cold ocean water temperatures still in the 50s. Dangerous
rip currents are also possible along with drownings related to
cold water shock. Never turn your back to the ocean.

(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 338 AM PDT Thu Jun 29 2023

The marine layer depth is approx 1500 feet, increasing warming
aloft due to large scale compression under a strengthening 500 mb
ridge over the eastern Pacific nearing our cwa is showing up on
the profilers at Bodega Bay and Fort Ord. The SFO-SAC pressure
gradient is 2.7 mb, the ACV-SFO pressure gradient 3.1 mb resulting
in an onshore wind, with sea surface temps cooled to 51F-57F and
dew point temps in the lower 50s nearly ideal conditions for
ocean stratus and fog development enhanced at night under near
surface to surface cooling. Coastal stratus and fog /VLIFR-IFR/
continuing to move inland this morning, the HREF under-forecasting
areal coverage IFR. Net warming is forecast at 925 mb today through
Friday per the NAM model which will result in coastal VLIFR-IFR
while also putting the brakes on the inland stratus and fog intrusion,
also leading to an earlier mix out time today since the marine layer
will become increasingly compressed. Otherwise VFR today. Stratus and
fog /VLIFR-IFR/ along the immediate coastline today through Friday,
otherwise VFR.

Vicinity of SFO...IFR due to stratus this morning. Onshore wind
near 10 knots through morning, increasing to 20 to 25 knots in
the afternoon. IFR ceiling lifting to MVFR-VFR by late morning.
IFR returning early this evening and tonight.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...VLIFR-IFR due to stratus, fog, including a
few patches of light drizzle this morning. Ceilings lifting to MVFR-
VFR by late morning or early afternoon. Onshore winds 5 to 10 knots.
Stratus and fog /VLIFR-IFR/ moving locally inland tonight and Friday
morning.

.MARINE...
(Today through Tuesday)
Issued at 300 AM PDT Thu Jun 29 2023

Surface high pressure over the eastern Pacific will steadily
strengthen through this weekend and early next week. Gusty
northwesterly winds continuing through early next week, peaking
Friday and Saturday when gale force gusts are possible across the
northern outer waters. These strong winds will continue to create
and maintain steep wind waves, creating hazardous conditions for
small craft. Mixed seas continue with longer period southerly
swell and moderate period northwesterly swell continuing through
the end of the week.

.FIRE WEATHER...
(Today through Tuesday)
Issued at 300 AM PDT Thu Jun 29 2023

Hot and dry conditions inland will will increase fire danger and
ignition probabilities as early as this afternoon when
widespread temperatures reach the 90s for the first time this
summer. Meanwhile, the marine layer will compress to less than
1000 feet Thursday night through Sunday resulting in little to no
overnight humidity recovery in the hills. Hot afternoon
temperatures will be followed by mild to warm nights in the
higher terrain. Overall, this heat event will feature light
winds, especially inland with light onshore breezes near the coast
and in the coastal valleys. As a result, ERC values will climb
sharply this weekend, likely above the 90th percentile in the
hills with muted growth for lower elevations that will still see
better humidity recovery each night. Despite the cool down early
next week, more modest humidity recoveries lag behind in the far
interior and in the higher terrain. Any nighttime ignitions in
the hills this weekend will not get typical humidity recover to
help with suppression.
