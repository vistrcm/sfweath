.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 335 AM PDT Thu Oct 10 2024

We`ll see increasing cloud cover and cooler temperatures into the
weekend, with rain chances ramping up late Friday night, and
persisting through late Saturday. The North Bay Hills and Valleys
are in the best position to see wetting rains up to around a half
inch, with periods of light rain and lesser amounts expected south
into the Bay Area and East Bay Hills.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 335 AM PDT Thu Oct 10 2024

As the marine layer continues to rebound, low stratus along the
coast, patchy fog and light drizzle early this morning has persisted
with occasional interruptions from mid/upper level cloud cover
increasing across our area out ahead of a closed low over the
eastern Pacific. Daytime highs will mostly hover around normal for
most locations today with some warmer temperatures inland above the
marine layer. Surface ridging tomorrow out ahead of the incoming
upper low will result in a weak surface pressure gradient and a
modest increase in coastal stratus, fog and drizzle late in the day
Friday into early Saturday.

.LONG TERM...
(Friday through Wednesday)
Issued at 335 AM PDT Thu Oct 10 2024

Rain chances begin to ramp up late Friday night across the North Bay
and Bay Area, and will continue through the day on Saturday as an
upper level low approaches the NorCal coast. The position of the low
as it moves inland has been been gradually shifting north in
subsequent model runs. Portions of the North Bay may see up to a
half inch of rain by the time the system exits to the east late
Saturday night, with lesser amounts, up to a tenth of an inch over
the Bay area and portions of the East Bay Hills.

An active longwave synoptic pattern will result in progressive upper
level ridging over our area in the wake of the upper low into
beginning of next week, and slightly warmer temperatures Sunday
through Tuesday, while another deeper trough develops offshore.
Deterministic extended guidance hints at the potential for more
widespread rainfall across our area by the middle of next week.
We`ll wait to see if the ensembles start to signal for the same
before getting too optimistic.

LIFR CIGS and fog are affecting the Monterey Bay with broken high
clouds passing over the region. Expect light to moderate winds
through the late morning. The lower CIGS and fog erode in the
late morning as moderate to breezy winds to build in afternoon.
Winds look to reduce in the mid evening with CIGs moving inland in
the late light.


Vicinity of SFO...VFR through the TAF period. Winds stay moderate
through the late morning before increasing into the afternoon.
Expect gusts around 20 kts to last into the late evening before
reducing.

Monterey Bay Terminals...LIFR CIGs last through the late morning
with some pockets of fog. Expect light winds through the night
