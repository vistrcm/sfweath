...New AVIATION...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 232 AM PDT Tue Jul 18 2023

Near seasonal normal temperatures expected today and tomorrow.
High pressure builds in through the week leading to gradual
warming to above-normal temperatures by the weekend.

&&

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 232 AM PDT Tue Jul 18 2023

It`s a quiet night across the Bay Area with temperatures running
about 5 to 10 degrees cooler tonight than compared to this same time
last night as cold air advection helps to reduce temperatures.
Satellite imagery shows rather sparse marine stratus, with a large
patch just beginning to form off of the San Francisco and Marin
county coastline. In the Monterey Bay region, patchy fog has
developed on the northern side over Watsonville, meanwhile clear
skies prevail elsewhere.


Expect temperatures near to just slightly below seasonal normals
today and Wednesday, with highs in the mid 80s to low 90s for
interior locations, and upper 60s to low 70s for Bay shorelines.
Overall, quiet weather expected as zonal flow aloft prevails the
next few days.

.LONG TERM...
(Wednesday through Monday)
Issued at 232 AM PDT Tue Jul 18 2023

Looking beyond Tuesday, temperatures are expected to slowly climb
once again to become above-normal as high pressure over the desert
southwest once again retrogrades, tracking west over our region. As
it currently stands, not expecting the high to center over our
region as it moreso did in the heat event this past weekend.
Instead, it appears to center over the Great Basin region come
Saturday, before tracking eastward. That being said, expect warmer
than normal temperatures by about 5 to 10 degrees to return this
upcoming weekend. High temperatures in interior locations look to
reach the upper 90s to low 100s, with mid to upper 80s around the
Bay Area. The immediate coastline is expected to stay cool and
comfortable in the 60s and 70s, with Friday currently looking to
be the warmest day, before slight cooling into Sunday as the high
pressure moves eastward.
