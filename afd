...New AVIATION...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 208 AM PDT Mon Aug 7 2023

War temperatures continue today, but will be slightly cooler. Much
cooler temperatures arrive Tuesday lasting through the end of the
week. Moisture associated with Tropical Storm Eugene to impact
southern areas Wednesday into Thursday.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 208 AM PDT Mon Aug 7 2023

The upper level ridge that gave us the warm temperatures this past
weekend is beginning to retreat towards the east, and an upper level
trough will develop through the day. As a result, temperatures
across the region will be a few degrees cooler than yesterday. High
temperatures today will rise to the mid to upper 90s in the inland
valleys, with only the most interior places reaching 100. Across the
Bayshore, highs will reach the mid to upper 70s, while the Pacific
coast sees temperatures from the mid 60s to the low 70s. A generally
northwesterly flow will develop this afternoon, with wind speeds up
to 20-25 miles per hour across the breeziest regions. As the upper
level trough deepens over California, the marine layer will
expand, enhancing the inland development of stratus across the
inland valleys, especially in the San Francisco Bay Area where
inland regions have seen a couple of nights of clear skies.

.LONG TERM...
(Tuesday through Sunday)
Issued at 208 AM PDT Mon Aug 7 2023

Cooler temperatures are still expected for tomorrow as upper
level trough along the W Coast deepens. We`re talking a 10-15
degree drop from today into tomorrow. Upper troughing will
persist through the end of the week, allowing for the marine
layer to deepen, promoting cooler temperatures across the region.
Not expecting much day-to-day change in temps through the end of
the week. Interior spots will generally be in the upper 80s to
low 90s and the coastline will be in the upper 60s to mid 70s.
Onshore flow will also continue.

We continue to track the influx of mid level moisture arriving to
the southern portion of the forecast area (S Monterey & San Benito
Counties) anywhere between Wednesday morning to Thursday morning
as TS Eugene weakens and drifts north. Models differ still on the
timing of moisture arrival into the area (NAM trending earlier
while GFS trends later and ECMWF somewhere in the middle). Stuck
with 15-20% chance PoPs for S Monterey and San Benito counties
beginning early Wed through Thu afternoon. KMRY and KSNS have
about 10-20% of their ensemble members showing light precip
amounts during Thursday to Friday timeframe, so confidence to
extend the slight chance for PoPs further north is low at this
time - most likely scenario at this time is any rain chances will
stay further south bordering SLO County and the San Joaquin Valley
sometime Wed-Thu timeframe. Forecast soundings and cross section
analysis in this region show most of moisture will remain in the
mid to upper levels. NAM forecast soundings also show MUCAPE
values ranging from 400-800 J/kg collocated with surge of
moisture, so slight chance (15%) for thunder was added to the very
southern portion of Monterey County. Will have to continue to
monitor as CAM output becomes available.

This system will weaken as it moves north over the Bay Area,
lifting and merging with the upper level trough that is already
over the W Coast. As of now, not expecting any rain over the Bay
Area but increased cloudiness expected. As upper low continues to
weaken by the weekend, WPC cluster analysis shows agreement among
ensemble members for a shortwave ridge to develop offshore the
Pacific NW and high pressure over the southern US to encroach
westward yet again. As a result, temperatures will start to warm
again this weekend into early next week.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 427 AM PDT Mon Aug 7 2023

Patches of fog and low stratus near WVI, with moderate confidence to
cover the Monterey Bay region overnight, although timing is
uncertain. Clearing expected around 16-18Z. Westerly onshore flow
develops this afternoon with speeds of 10-15 knots at the terminals.
As the upper level trough develops today, the marine layer will
expand and result in increased inland stratus coverage tonight into
Tuesday morning. Model output is showing that southwesterly flow
will develop across the SF Bay on Tuesday; monitor future TAF
updates for strength of the flow. Hazy conditions will continue to
impact slant-range visibilities, mainly around sunrise and sunset.

Vicinity of SFO...VFR through the rest of the night with breezy west
winds. West-northwest flow develops again this afternoon with gusts
up to 25 knots, diminishing in the evening. MVFR stratus will return
to the SF Bay tonight into Tuesday morning, with the greatest chance
for impacts at the terminal in the early morning on Tuesday.
Southwesterly flow developing over SFO Tuesday, with some model
output suggesting gusts up to 20 knots. Although confidence is too
low to forecast gust strength at this time, monitor future TAF
updates for the latest information.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO. Hazy conditions will continue
to impact slant-range visibilities, mainly around sunrise and sunset.

Monterey Bay Terminals...Fog and low stratus developing over the
bay, with moderate confidence for impact to the terminals at some
point tonight, although timing is uncertain as radiational processes
are dominating fog and stratus development. West-northwest winds
this afternoon with speeds up to 10-12 knots. A deeper marine layer
enhances the return of stratus around 01-03Z on Monday evening, with
some models suggesting the development of fog at MRY as the night
goes on.

.MARINE...
(Today through Saturday)
Issued at 208 AM PDT Mon Aug 7 2023

Breezy to gusty north to northwest winds continue across the
northern waters through midweek, while winds across the southern
waters will diminish over the next few days as surface high
pressure shifts further offshore. Light southerly swell continues
in addition to short period wind waves.
