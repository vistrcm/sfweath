.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 101 AM PDT Fri Oct 13 2023

Another round of light rain for the North Bay tonight into
Saturday morning. Warming and drying trend through the rest of the
weekend. Additional ridging aloft and above normal temperatures
next week.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 101 AM PDT Fri Oct 13 2023

The atmosphere remains well mixed between troughs with the next
one currently approaching the coast. Evident via satellite and
yesterday evening`s 00Z sounding, elevated upper level moisture
contributing to widespread high-level cloudiness out ahead of the
trough. Moisture will begin to increase across the lower to mid
levels of the atmosphere as SW winds aloft increase through this
morning. High res guidance supports a line of light showers
associated with a surface front moving through the North Bay by
this evening. Amounts appear on the lighter side, 0.1" or so at
most along the coast, a few hundredths elsewhere across Sonoma and
Marin counties and the northern SF Peninsula. Rain will be moving
out by early Saturday morning, giving way to a warming and drying
trend to round out the weekend.

.LONG TERM...
(Saturday through Thursday)
Issued at 101 AM PDT Fri Oct 13 2023

Warming and drying trend after a surface front vacates the region
on Saturday. Ensemble guidance is advertising another brief shot
of light rain for the North Bay on Monday as the parent upper low
currently in the Gulf of Alaska finally moves into western Canada.
Similar to what we have seen this week, amounts look to be very
light and limited to the North Bay. Beyond Monday, model cluster
analysis supports high confidence in high amplitude ridging across
the West Coast through the latter half of the week. Aside from any
slight changes to the rain forecast through Monday, this is where
our attention is focused next. Heat Risk looks to be elevated
for urban areas as high temperatures are forecast to be well
above seasonal normals by the end of this forecast period.
