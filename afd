.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 415 AM PST Wed Dec 13 2023

Dense fog, with visibility less than 1/4 mile, continues to develop
across the San Francisco Bay area this morning. Cirrus clouds continue
moving in from the northwest through an upper level ridge of high
pressure. At the surface, offshore northeasterly winds are developing,
mainly found at higher elevations across the Bay Area where it is
gusty this morning. Offshore winds should mix out the fog during the
morning. Where and if fog persists, daytime highs may not get as
warm as forecast. Offshore drying winds continue through the weekend,
while some unsettled wet weather returns to the Bay Area by the end
of the weekend. More unsettled wet weather possible next week.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 433 AM PST Wed Dec 13 2023

A carryover from Tuesday and now more widespread in the Bay Area,
ideal conditions continue for nocturnal fog and dense fog i.e. a
stable atmosphere, light mixing winds, long night-time hours for
radiative cooling to space (net loss of heat) allowing the
atmosphere to cool to saturation. A lower level temperature
inversion remains compressed to near Earth`s surface under a 500
mb ridge of high pressure (sinking air, warming the air aloft
through compression). Cirrus clouds are moving through the 500 mb
ridge axis, the clouds may slow radiative cooling through the
morning, however fog and dense fog conditions already have a
strong foothold; waiting for offshore winds to begin mixing out
the fog, which may just be beginning per recent observations on
the coast and at SFO.

A Dense Fog Advisory is in effect for much of the Bay Area until
10 am today. Dangerously low visibilities in dense fog also covers
the San Francisco Bay, where a Dense Fog Advisory is also in effect
until 8 am today. There`s some uncertainty in the forecast rate of
dispersion of fog this morning, land based fog (vs bay fog) may be
tougher to mix out, also depending on arrival of mixing northeasterly
winds and thickness and areal coverage of cirrus clouds; either way
will adjust expiration times to advisories as needed depending on
surface observations and satellite imagery later in the morning.

Winds in the hills and mountain tops are gusty from the northeast
this morning, otherwise mostly if not entirely decoupled from the
surface winds in the valleys. An offshore pressure gradient, WMC-SFO
7.6 mb currently, and wind is forecast to continue today through
the weekend. Offshore winds will have a drying influence on initial
rain arriving from the west this weekend.

Across the southern interior, a clear sky and drier surface air
is allowing radiative cooling to freezing to sub-freezing
temperatures. A Freeze Warning is in effect for interior San
Benito and Monterey Counties including the southern Salinas Valley
until 9 am today.

Similar to Tuesday`s all day fog in much of the North Bay valleys
limiting surface warming i.e. daytime high temperatures, there may
be a similarly repeating occurrence today; extent of remaining fog
today will depend on how well developed the offshore winds become
during the morning. For tonight, model forecasts show less fog due
to offshore (drying, mixing) winds.

Minor coastal flooding is again a concern for this morning around
the San Francisco/San Pablo Bay as tidal levels are running about
1/2 foot above predictions. High tide for San Francisco is 10:42
AM today.

.LONG TERM...
(Thursday through Tuesday)
Issued at 433 AM PST Wed Dec 13 2023

The 500 mb ridge axis is forecast to be located over the Bay Area
Thursday morning, the height ridge steadily strengthening while
moving eastward due to warm air advection from the out of phase
thermal ridge following just to the west. Lower to mid level winds
shift to a southerly direction late tonight and Thursday and
steadily increase mainly Friday and Saturday. 850 mb temperatures
on the NAM model are forecast near the 75th percentile per comparison
to Oakland upper air mid December climatology through late week.
Daytime warming to near record high temperature(s) for example in
the South Bay late this week will need to fully tap dry adiabatic
compressional warming from 850 mb to the surface, which is tough
to achieve this time of year due a low sun angle, shorter daylight
hours, less vertical mixing, potential cloud cover, etc. Recent
statistical guidance is slightly cooler than recent official NWS
forecasts for the South Bay late this week. San Jose may have
difficulty breaking above 70F, rather may stay in the mid 60s for
example; normal mid Dec high is 59F.

There`s good near term model agreement that a long wave trough
over the eastern Pacific will reach ~ 135W longitude, a few
hundred miles west of the Bay Area by late week and the weekend.
Surface high pressure will remain over the Great Basin resulting
in an ongoing WMC-SFO gradient and offshore (drying) wind,
steepening a bit more with surface pressures lowering along our
coast out to the surface low center well offshore. Model forecasts
for rain will be up against initial drying influence of offshore
winds, until perhaps late in the weekend when lower to mid level
winds shift from southeast to southwest with trough passage. From
late Monday and Tuesday onward next week there`s uncertainty in
the eastern Pacific weather pattern, for example how and where
does the next trough of low pressure evolve which will then
determine the next chances of rain in our forecast area. The north
hemispheric long wave pattern is between 5 to maybe 4 long waves
in the near to medium forecast range; it`d add confidence to the
next week`s wet weather potential here in our forecast area if
there were more long waves troughs than at present, currently not
quite as ideal as it could be if say there were 6 to 7 long waves.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 332 AM PST Wed Dec 13 2023

Satellite imagery showing fog and low stratus across the North Bay
Valleys, across the SF Bayshore region and into the Santa Clara
Valley. Main forecast issue is whether breezy offshore winds will
develop and help mix out the stratus layers, especially from the
Delta through the Golden Gate. This transition is expected around
the start of the TAF period, making for a difficult call for the
prevailing line. Have opted to extend IFR-LIFR ceilings to 15Z at
SFO and OAK, monitor future TAF updates for updated information.
Farther afield (near SJC and STS), stratus is expected to clear in
the mid- to late morning, as would be the case at SFO and OAK if
expected offshore winds are weaker than expected. Light and
generally offshore flow will continue through the day with a coastal
breeze in the afternoon hours, generally remaining VFR through the
TAF period with low confidence for patchy low stratus near STS and
Monterey Bay.

Vicinity of SFO... Current TAF is for fog to dissipate rather early
this morning, but this is dependent on offshore winds developing at
the terminal. Without those offshore winds, expect stratus to clear
out around the mid- to late morning hours. Generally light northwest
flow will develop in the afternoon, diminishing in the evening
hours. VFR conditions expected to continue through the end of the
TAF period.

SFO Bridge Approach... Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals... Terminals expected to remain VFR through
the night, with light drainage flow turning onshore in the
afternoon. Models showing low confidence (up to 20-30% probability)
for patchy stratus in the region this evening into Thursday
morning.

.MARINE...
(Tonight through next Sunday)
Issued at 252 AM PST Wed Dec 13 2023

Dense fog is possible across the San Francisco Bay through
Wednesday morning. Light winds continue through Thursday as high
pressure builds once again. New storm system approaches this
weekend, bringing widespread rain and increasing southerly winds.
Current northwest swell diminishes through tomorrow with a
northwest new swell building late Wednesday into Thursday. Large
southwest swell arrives this weekend.
