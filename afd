.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 256 AM PST Thu Nov 28 2024

High pressure continues to build over the West Coast with cooler
mornings and drier conditions on tap for the next few days. A Frost
Advisory is in effect through 9 AM PST Thursday morning for interior
portions of the Bay Area and Central Coast. Widespread near freezing
temperatures are expected within the Frost Advisory with locations
in southern Monterey County and the North Bay Valleys potentially
seeing temperatures as low as 30 degrees. Skies are clear across
most of the CWA with only a few high clouds drifting across the
Central Coast. Fog remains possible throughout the interior valleys
of Sonoma County through the morning hours with California Alert
Cameras currently showing fog developing along the Russian River.
Fog chances decrease mid to late morning with high level clouds
gradually spreading south to north across the region throughout the
day. Daytime highs will peak in the low to mid 60s throughout the
interior and upper 50s to low 60s along the coast. Cooler

.LONG TERM...
(Friday through Wednesday)
Issued at 256 AM PST Thu Nov 28 2024

Quiet conditions continue through the long term as high pressure and
upper level ridging dominate, pushing the storm track well to our
north. Cold mornings will continue through Sunday with Frost
Advisories in place from 10 PM Thursday to 9 AM Friday and again 10
PM Friday to 9 AM Saturday. Morning lows will gradually improve
Sunday through the early work week with morning lows rising back
into the 40s. High temperatures will remain seasonal to slightly
warmer than normal in the mid to upper 60s with the warmest portions
of the Santa Clara Valley and Central Coast reaching the low 70s.
Models are picking up on some rain potential at the end of next week
as a weak upper level low develops over the southern
California/Arizona region but confidence remains low at this time.
All in all, pleasant weather is expected this week and everyone
should take advantage of it!
