.SHORT TERM...
Issued at 252 AM PST Sun Jan 25 2026
(Today and tonight)

Tule fog in the vicinity of the East Bay and southern Napa County is
struggling to advance farther west where dewpoint depressions in
lower lying areas remain around 5-10 degrees as of 3AM PST. High
clouds have begun making their way inland on the subsident side of
the amplified ridge axis just offshore and will continuing
drifting over our area throughout the day. Although the synoptic
ridging pattern across the west will persist into the beginning of
the upcoming work week, we`ll see a series of shortwave troughs
interrupt the ridging at our latitude with little impact on our
ambient weather conditions today and tonight. High temperatures
today will be cooler than Saturday for the North Bay, Bay Area and
East Bay with increasing mid/high level cloud cover and the weak
offshore flow getting neutralized. Overnight lows into early
Monday morning will also tick a few degrees warmer for most of
our interior locations.

.LONG TERM...
Issued at 252 AM PST Sun Jan 25 2026
(Monday through Saturday)

Modest increases in mid level heights and thickness will increase
temperatures on Monday into the low to mid 60s for most of our area
as the upper level ridging is reinvigorated through Tuesday.
However, the reincarnated ridging on Tuesday is progressive. A
deepening trough over the eastern Pacific in the wake of the ridging
appears to lift north as it approaches the coast, with a trend
toward less rainfall for our area Wednesday from the previous update
Saturday afternoon. The longwave synoptic pattern remains active
through the remainder of the extended forecast, especially for
eastern CONUS, but the net result for the Bay Area and Central Coast
is relatively quiet weather. There`s a slight chance for some light
amounts of beneficial rain next weekend.
