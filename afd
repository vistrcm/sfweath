...New UPDATE, MARINE...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 128 AM PDT Sat Oct 12 2024

An approaching cold front will bring light rain to the North Bay
today. A warming trend is expected Sunday through Tuesday before a
stronger system brings more widespread rain potential next
Wednesday.

.UPDATE...
Issued at 915 AM PDT Sat Oct 12 2024

As of this morning, light scattered rain showers have reached
coastal portions of Sonoma County with more showers located just
offshore. Precipitation totals have been relatively low so far this
morning with most stations reporting only a few hundredths of an inch
(0.01-0.04") along the Sonoma Coast. However, these totals do
increase the closer you go to the Sonoma and Mendocino (NWS Eureka`s
CWA) county line. Notably Sea Ranch, located in far northern coastal
Sonoma, is reporting a total of 0.26" of rain in the last six hours!
A 20-25% chance of a trace to a few hundredths of an inch of rain
remain possible along the SF Peninsula and bayside portions of the
East Bay through the remainder of the morning and into the
afternoon. For rain enthusiasts who are missing out today, we are
continuing to monitor more widespread potential for light rain to
occur mid to late week.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 128 AM PDT Sat Oct 12 2024

A cold front is approaching the region at this hour and is
expected to bring light rain to primarily the North Bay throughout
the morning. While rain may make it south of the Golden Gate,
rainfall totals will be trace amounts to a few hundredths of an
inch. However, coastal Sonoma County is likely to pick up between
0.15-0.40" with lesser amounts as you move inland and southward.
While the rain will be light in San Francisco, low ceilings will
very likely impact the Fleet Week aerial shows.

Temperatures this afternoon will generally range from the mid-
to-upper 60`s to lower 70`s across the North Bay and coastal
areas across the region. Inland, temperatures are likely to reach
the mid 70`s to low 80`s. Tonight, increased cloud cover will
allow temperatures to be in the low-to-mid 50`s to lower 60`s in
the warmer interior valleys (such as the Santa Clara valley and
the East Bay valleys). Coastal and favored upslope regions will
have a slight chance of drizzle overnight as well.

&&

.LONG TERM...
(Sunday through Friday)
Issued at 128 AM PDT Sat Oct 12 2024

A short wave ridge will build in across the region from Sunday
through Tuesday resulting in a slight warming trend. Generally,
temperature will be near seasonal averages through this timeframe.
Another frontal boundary will approach the region Tuesday night
into Wednesday and produce light rainfall across much of the
region. However, rainfall amounts appear at this time to be light
generating between 0.10-0.25". However, details thus far out are
difficult to nail down and the forecast will continue to be
updated as this next system draws nearer.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 342 AM PDT Sat Oct 12 2024

Low stratus have pushed further inland creating MVFR/IFR conditions
for most of the terminals, except KLVK. VFR will return between 17-
19Z for most terminals. There is some uncertainty for KSTS as models
suggest a short period of VFR near 03Z but there is a chance
MVFR/IFR conditions may linger through the TAF period. Otherwise,
most terminals are expected to see a return of MVFR/IFR conditions
by Saturday evening/late night. Light to moderate winds will have a
bit of a southerly component but will generally return to onshore by
the afternoon.

Vicinity of SFO...MVFR with clearing to VFR by 17-18Z. Timing is a
bit uncertain as some models show clearing near 19Z. MVFR is
expected to return by 05Z, with a chance of IFR conditions near 09-
10Z. Wind will remain relatively moderate through most of the TAF
period.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...IFR but there is a chance CIGs may lower to
LIFR again within the next few hours. Clearing to VFR is expected
near 17-18Z but confidence is moderate as there is a chance for
clearing near 19Z. Another round of IFR conditions will occur
Saturday evening, but confidence is low on timing. Expect a return
between 02-05Z.

.MARINE...
(Today through Thursday)
Issued at 915 AM PDT Sat Oct 12 2024

Gentle to occasionally moderate southerly breezes are forecast to
persist through early Sunday, before breezes become northerly in
the wake of a weak front. Light rain showers will continue today
and tonight, especially from areas near and north of the
Farallones, though there remains some potential for showers across
the deeper waters farther south. Seas of 7 to 10 feet will
subside through Monday evening, before re-building overnight into
Tuesday. Hazardous boating conditions are becoming increasingly
probable for next week. Moderate to large swell with periods
approaching 12 to 15 seconds are forecast through the day on
Tuesday. A strong storm system will encourage strong to near gale
force breezes mid- week and onward with seas elevating shortly
thereafter.
