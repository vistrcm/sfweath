...New AVIATION...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 311 AM PDT Sat Aug 26 2023

Night and morning clouds clearing to the coast each afternoon will
continue through the weekend. Temperatures will warm slightly
today, but further warming and drying will develop early next
week.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 311 AM PDT Sat Aug 26 2023

Subtle changes in the longwave pattern over the west has also
resulted in subtle changes locally. The wound up upper level low
spinning off the CA/OR continues to slowly move northward.
Additionally, the broad upper level high to the east is slowly
building westward overnight. Building 500mb heights and a
slightly stronger N-S (SFO-ACV) gradient has helped to compress
the marine layer. Latest profilers put the depth at just under
2,000 feet, which is also reflected on the satellite fog product
with less cloud cover. Even with "less" cloud cover stratus
blankets the coastline, bays, West Delta, and much of the inland
valleys. Given the compressed nature seeing a few more reports of
fog overnight too. KSTS and KAPC in the North Bay are both
reporting visibilities less than one mile.

Do expect an earlier clearing time of clouds today given the
slightly compressed nature. Building high pressure, earlier onset
stratus clearing, and warming airmass aloft will lead to slightly
warmer temperatures today. Highs today will be warmer than Friday
and up to five degrees warmer in the warmest interior locations.
Highs will be 60s to near 80 at the coast and 80s to mid 90s
interior. The N-S gradient is expected to increase further through
the day as well. The end result will be stronger northerly winds,
especially over the coastal waters and along the immediate coast.
The stronger NW winds will assist in better mixing of the coastal
waters so expect buoy temperatures to drop over the next day or
two.

.LONG TERM...
(Sunday through Friday)
Issued at 350 AM PDT Sat Aug 26 2023

The aforementioned upper level ridge will continue to flex
westward through the middle of next week. The marine layer will
continue to be compressed as high pressure builds overhead. The
warming trend noted for Saturday will continue Sunday through
Wednesday. The peak of the warmth still appears to be Tuesday and
Wednesday. While 500 mb heights exceed 590 DAM the supporting
850mb temps stay in the mid 20C range. The real warm portion of
the upper ridge remains locked in over the deserts and Desert SW.
Therefore, the Bay Area and Central Coast will once again escape
the brunt of the real heat. However, still expecting far interior
locations to reach triple digits. Probabilistic guidance gives
medium to high confidence for interior locations to exceed 90 degs
Tuesday and Wednesday with far interior locations low (20-40%)
confidence to break 100 degrees. The building warmth will make
thermal belts more active with mild lows in the hills, but still
seeing some relief elsewhere. Despite the uptick in temperatures
HeatRisk remains in the Moderate category. No Heat Advisory needed
at this time.

A noticed cooling trend develops Thursday and Friday as the ridge
flattens and a trough of low pressure moves through the state. The
passing trough will also help to enhance the marine layer.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 432 AM PDT Sat Aug 26 2023

Widespread CIGs are affecting the area. Pockets of mist and fog
are building in the North Bay and around the Monterey Bay. Cloud
cover thins in the late morning/early afternoon with light winds
becoming moderate to breezy for the afternoon. Cloud cover will
be slower struggle to build into Saturday night, mostly staying on
the immediate coast even as winds become light.

Vicinity of SFO...IFR with moderate westerly winds through the mid
to late morning. As VFR returns, westerly winds become gusty for
the afternoon. These winds reduce into Saturday night scattered
cloud cover expected.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...IFR/LIFR CIGs with light winds and some
pockets of fog last into the late morning. VFR returns Saturday
afternoon with moderate westerly winds. These winds reduce late
into the evening with IFR CIGs filling around the Monterey Bay
and MRY.

.MARINE...
(Today through Thursday)
Issued at 311 AM PDT Sat Aug 26 2023

Breezy and gusty northwest winds last through the weekend,
especially near the coastal jet south of Pigeon Point. Strong
breezes and near gale force winds linger into the middle of next
week will create hazards for small craft in the coastal waters. A
mix of moderate period (14-16 second) southerly swell and shorter
period northerly swell continues through the middle of the work
week next week.
