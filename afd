...New AVIATION, MARINE...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 245 AM PST Tue Dec 12 2023

Fog and low clouds continue to develop around the Bay Area this
morning. Clearing late this morning. Dry weather this week with a
warming trend. A chance of rain this weekend.

&&

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 314 AM PST Tue Dec 12 2023

Monitoring fog developing over the Bay Area, surface observations
have shown visibilities as low as 1/4 mile or briefly lower at
times in the North Bay valleys and not quite as low elsewhere. A
maritime intrusion of fog (vs Tule fog from the Central Valley)
and low clouds continue to fill in across much of the Bay Area;
not completely ruling out a dense fog advisory this morning, for
now will monitor surface observations and webcams.

Clearing later this morning, high temperatures recovering to the
lower to mid 60s today. Patchy valley fog redeveloping tonight
and Wednesday morning.

&&

.LONG TERM...
(Wednesday through Monday)
Issued at 314 AM PST Tue Dec 12 2023

Patchy valley fog lifting by late Wednesday morning, otherwise
daytime highs similarly climbing back to the lower to mid 60s. A
warming trend develops through late week, temperatures well above
normal possibly nearing a few record highs late in the week. Wet
weather is likely to develop this weekend, however GEFS and EPS
ensemble qpf forecasts have trended lower across the forecast area.
Global model solutions diverge beyond 120 hours, it`s a low
confidence forecast beyond 5 days.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 316 AM PST Tue Dec 12 2023

Satellite imagery shows widespread fog and low stratus across the
lower elevations of the greater SF Bay Area. Added ceilings at LVK
as they have developed over the terminal. Some model output has
patchy and transient stratus developing this evening in the southern
Monterey Bay region, with more patches of stratus in the SF Bay Area
and the North Bay valleys later that night. Main question  in terms
of stratus extent overnight into Wednesday morning is if the
offshore flow expected at the higher elevations makes it to the
lower elevations. If it does, the offshore wind would inhibit
stratus development. Will continue to monitor through the day.

Vicinity of SFO... IFR stratus and light winds continue through
around 19-20Z, with breezy west-northwest winds developing in the
afternoon. Low to moderate confidence in stratus development late
tonight to early Wednesday morning at the terminal, which may be
mitigated if overnight offshore flow strengthens.

SFO Bridge Approach... Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals... Moderate to high confidence that the
terminals remain VFR through the night. Satellite imagery shows
possible low stratus just off the Monterey Peninsula, so have kept a
TEMPO group for MVFR-IFR ceilings for the mid-morning hours. Light
northwest winds developing in the afternoon. Some model output is
showing stratus developing rather early in the evening near MRY, but
the patchy nature of this stratus makes a high confidence forecast
for timing or location impossible. Best forecast calls for some
chances for stratus in the evening through early overnight hours,
with chances for stratus diminishing after midnight.

&&

.MARINE...
(Today through Sunday)
Issued at 316 AM PST Tue Dec 12 2023

High pressure off of the Pacific Northwest coast and low pressure
near the California coast will maintain northerly winds over the
coastal waters. Gusty winds build over the southern waters early
this week as an upper level low deepens into the Great Basin.
Winds diminish into the later half of the week as high pressure
builds once again. New storm system approaches next weekend.
Northwesterly swell diminishing through tomorrow with a new swell
system building late Wednesday into Thursday.

&&

.BEACHES...
Issued at 221 AM PST Tue Dec 12 2023

High astronomical tides are expected by late morning each day
through mid-week including today. Currently a coastal flood
advisory is *not* in effect, however will continue to closely
monitor the tides especially around coastal Marin County due to
slightly higher high tides at and slightly above 6.5 feet through
mid-week. High tides are predicted to gradually subside late this
week.

&&

.MTR WATCHES/WARNINGS/ADVISORIES...
CA...None.
PZ...Small Craft Advisory until 9 PM PST this evening for Pt Pinos to
     Pt Piedras Blancas 0-10 nm.
