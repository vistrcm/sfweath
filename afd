.SHORT TERM...
Issued at 1232 AM PDT Thu Oct 23 2025
(Today and tonight)

A short wave ridge is building and will be the dominate feature in
the short term, bringing fairly tranquil conditions. The marine
layer is reforming tonight and the mostly clear skies will start
to fill in with low stratus by sunrise. These clouds will clear in
the late morning before a fantastic afternoon with clear skies,
light winds, and temperatures reaching mid 70s inland with 60s
along the coast. High clouds will push in from the North through
the afternoon. These clouds are the first signal of an approaching
change in the weather pattern. In the meantime, they should make
for a nice sunset to end a pleasant day.

.LONG TERM...
Issued at 1232 AM PDT Thu Oct 23 2025
(Friday through Wednesday)

Friday will be similar to Thursday, albeit with more high cloud
cover signaling the approaching cold front. This front is
supported by a trough in the upper levels that will push out the
ridge and flip the pattern from warm and dry to cool and wet by
Saturday. The confidence is high in the general pattern through
the weekend, but there has been some changes in the details. It
now looks like the rain will arrive later, and won`t be as wet as
we thought a couple days ago. The current forecast now has rain
reaching the North Bay very early Saturday morning rather than
late Friday. The total rain should be around 1/4-1/2" in the North
Bay, with up to 1/10" across the Bay Area, and a few hundredths
across the Central Coast. While the system is ushering in a
robust pre-frontal tropical moisture plume in the shape of an
atmospheric river, it will move very quickly from N-S on Saturday.
Ensembles agree that the PW will reach between 200-250% of
normal, but in a thin ribbon that will push through the Bay Area
and Central Coast from Saturday morning through Saturday evening.
While short lived, most of the rain will come from this first
push. Some of the showers could be heavy, but should be brief.
After the cold front moves through there may be a 12 hour break
before a weaker push of postfrontal showers arrives Sunday and
lingers into Monday. Outside of rain, temperatures will be cooler
this weekend with most areas stuck in the 60s. There will also be
some gusty SW-W winds. With high moisture and a fast moving front,
thunderstorms are possible, but unlikely. The chances are mainly
held back due to pedestrian lapse rates of 4-6 C/km. The skies
should start to clear Monday afternoon as drier air slowly filters
in. The PW will stay above normal through midweek, but with
ridging aloft the chance for rain basically goes to zero by
Tuesday. This ridging looks to have some staying power, and
should keep dry conditions around through Halloween.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 427 AM PDT Thu Oct 23 2025

Current satellite showing a mix of clear skies and MVFR stratus.
Anticipating some lowering to IFR and increased coverage around
the Bay Area this morning, lingering until midday. Moderate
confidence in coverage of IFR cigs going into tonight with a
chance of patchy FG impacts for coastal terminals thru sunrise
Friday.

Vicinity of SFO...Decreasing confidence in IFR cigs this morning.
Some areas invof the terminal may experience patchy cigs through
sunrise. No other surprises beyond midday with typical onshore
flow and VFR through this evening. Slight chance of IFR cigs once
again just before sunrise Friday - low confidence.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...Patchy low clouds over terrain not
expected to have too much of a lasting impact on the terminals.
Moderate-high confidence in abrupt stratus return this evening
along southern Monterey Bay.

.MARINE...
(Today through Tuesday)
Issued at 427 AM PDT Thu Oct 23 2025

Moderate breeze persists through this weekend. Rough seas prevail
across the waters, becoming very rough this weekend as a storm
system moves in through the northeast Pacific. Chance of rain
showers over the northern waters beginning Saturday morning and
lasting through the weekend. Long period northwesterly swell
enters the waters Friday, peaking by Sunday.

&&

.BEACHES...
Issued at 941 PM PDT Wed Oct 22 2025

A moderate to long period northwesterly swell will result in
breaking waves of 12 to 17 feet, with the highest waves up to 25
feet in favored locations, and an increased risk for sneaker waves
and rip currents through the night. Sneaker waves can
unexpectedly run significantly farther up the beach than normal,
including over rocks and jetties. Rip currents are typically more
frequent and stronger in the vicinity of jetties, inlets, and
piers. Swimmers should always swim near a lifeguard. Remain out of
the water to avoid hazardous swimming conditions and never turn
your back on the ocean!
