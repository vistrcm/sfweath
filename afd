...New SYNOPSIS, SHORT TERM, LONG TERM, AVIATION, MARINE...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 311 AM PST Mon Nov 27 2023

A cold start followed by a warmer and Sunny afternoon. Cool again
to start Tuesday. Rainy conditions return Tuesday night with a wet
and unsettled pattern to last for the rest of the forecast.

&&

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 311 AM PST Mon Nov 27 2023

It`s another cold night as temperatures once again fall into the 30s
in the more interior areas while the coast sticks to the 40s and
even the low 50s. Those interior areas will be under a Frost
Advisory (interior North Bay) and Freeze warnings (San Benito and
Southern Monterey counties) through the mid morning. Expect mostly
clear skies for the first half of the day, allowing for good warming
in the late morning through the afternoon. High cloud cover build
for the second half of the day. Monday night into Tuesday offers
slightly warmer temperatures.

&&

.LONG TERM...
(Tuesday through Sunday)
Issued at 311 AM PST Mon Nov 27 2023

Tuesday offer sunny skies for much of the day but cloud cover and
some light drizzle build into the evening followed buy a trough
centering itself over the Bay Area and Central Coast. Chances for
rain are strong across most models and ensemble members starting
late Tuesday and lasting through early Thursday. Most areas will see
wetting rains, but the usually sheltered areas will see far less
than the coastal mountains, which is typical for this kind of
system. The North Bay Mountains will see 0.50" to 0.75" with much of
the Bay Area and the rest of the coast seeing 0.25" to 0.50" while
less than 0.25" is expected for the interior East Bay, Santa Clara
Valley, Salinas Valley, and San Benito Co.

The upper level pattern will allow for similar but weaker troughs to
move through the CWA again in the late week and into the weekend,
keeping at least slight rain chances through the rest of the
forecast. The late week chances look good, but much can still change
in the weekend`s forecast with some potential for the the rain
pattern to move farther north.

As mentioned in previous discussions, the longer-term models hint at
unsettled weather and wet conditions to continue into the next work
week.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 311 AM PST Mon Nov 27 2023

VFR through the TAF period. The rising pressure continues the calm
weather pattern. Models continue to struggle to find enough forcing
to justify much in the way of persistent winds. The forecast shows
winds will stay mostly light with some moderate easterly winds
occuring in the morning around the Monterey Bay and for LVK and APC
in the afternoon. Expect only high clouds for the TAF period.


Vicinity of SFO...VFR through the TAF period. Winds stay light and
Variable through the TAF period, but the next system nears beyond
the TAF period leading to more moderate westerly winds Tuesday
afternoon.


SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO

Monterey Bay Terminals...VFR through the TAF period. Southeasterly
winds last through the mid morning for MRY and into the afternoon
for SNS before becoming light and variable.

.MARINE...
(Today through Saturday)
Issued at 311 AM PST Mon Nov 27 2023

Expect the northwest swell to continue to weaken. Breezier and
wetter conditions will return by mid-week as a low pressure system
passes through the region. Winds are expected to temporarily
decrease after this system passes before a return to gustier
conditions Friday as more rain systems move through into the
weekend and the next work week.
