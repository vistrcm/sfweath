.SYNOPSIS...

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 228 AM PDT Sat Oct 7 2023

After a remarkably clear week, we are finally starting to see the
usual stratus creep back toward the coast this morning. While
it`s still clear across the Bay Area, clouds are approaching the
North Bay and San Diego has been reporting fog all night. It will
likely take another 18-24 hours before any substantial clouds
intrude past the coast as the warm dry air mass should put up
strong resistance.

The only notable change to the forecast today is for higher
temperatures and lower humidities in southern Monterey County,
including the area surrounding the newly started 50-acre Williams
Fire. The RAWS site at Bradley (RBYC1) reported a max temp of
100F and minimum humidity of 11% yesterday. While we were pretty
close on the temperature, the humidity was lower than expected.
Conditions look to be nearly identical today, and we adjusted the
forecast to reflect that trend. Luckily winds are expected to
remain light. Good humidity recoveries are expected Sat night.

Otherwise, no major changes were made to the short term forecast
today. We are still expecting afternoon temperatures to be a
couple degrees cooler than Fri for most areas.

This is the 4th day of well above average temperatures and heat
effects are cumulative. Remember to check on vulnerable
populations including pregnant women, children, elderly, those
with chronic illness, and anyone without adequate shelter. Don`t
leave passengers or pets in your car. Stay hydrated and take
breaks if working outside.

.LONG TERM...
(Sunday through Friday)
Issued at 228 AM PDT Sat Oct 7 2023

The marine layer will return Sunday. This will help bring a
substantial cool down of more than 10 degrees to coastal areas,
while inland areas cool more modestly. The big change occurs
Monday as a fast moving upper level trough supports a cold front
that will usher in a whole new air mass. Most of the area will
drop to well below average temperatures during an gloomy, overcast
day. Rain chances and expected accumulations are slowly
increasing as well. The North Bay is now looking at 1/4-1/2", San
Francisco and East Bay will likely see 1/10-1/4" and less than
1/10" is expected for the South Bay. Monterey Bay is still on the
fence, and Santa Cruz has a better chance of decent rainfall than
Monterey and Salinas. Farther South, the probability of any
measurable rainfall east of the Santa Lucia Range is less than
15%.

Temperatures will gradually warm up beginning Tuesday, returning
to near normal by Thursday. The jet stream will become more zonal
next week, which will increase the frequency of cold fronts and
associated precipitation events. After Monday`s frontal passage,
the next system looks to approach the area next weekend.

with the earliest arrival expected by 04-06Z Sunday around
Monterey Bay and closer to 10-12Z Sunday at KSFO.

Vicinity of SFO...VFR through early tomorrow evening with breezy
onshore winds this afternoon. A scattered low cloud deck may
develop by 04-06Z Sunday, with moderate confidence in IFR ceiling
development by 10-12Z Sunday.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to KSFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...VFR through late tomorrow afternoon.
Light offshore drainage wind tomorrow morning will become onshore
by the early to mid afternoon hours tomorrow. High confidence in
IFR clouds arriving around 04-06Z Sunday and persisting for the
remainder of the TAF cycle.

.MARINE...
(Today through Thursday)
Issued at 228 AM PDT Sat Oct 7 2023

Gentle to moderate northerly breezes and mixed seas will persist
through the weekend. A weather system will approach the local
waters early next week, with increasing winds and seas. Southerly
winds will increase ahead of the system, with northwesterly winds
behind it. Hazards for small craft operations are possible for mid
to late week with increasing winds and seas as a moderate period
northwest swell approaches.
