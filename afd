Warmer temperatures a few degrees above average today and
Wednesday. Cooler temperatures expected towards the end of the

.UPDATE...
Issued at 824 AM PDT Tue Aug 27 2024

Satellite imagery shows a robust deck of stratus at the immediate
coast, coming inland south of Watsonville to the Monterey
Peninsula region. Current temperatures are running near where they
were this time yesterday across the valleys, around 15 to 20
degrees below yesterday`s values along the Big Sur coast, and
around 5 to 10 degrees warmer than yesterday in the higher
elevations. Forecast remains on track with no updates at this
time.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and Wednesday)
Issued at 158 AM PDT Tue Aug 27 2024

Its a relatively quiet night. Coastal stratus is beginning to
push inland through the Salinas valley and the Golden Gate gap.
This morning, expect the Monterey Bay area and portions of the CWA
nearest the coast to be waking up to grey skies as a result of
the stratus intrusion. That`s right, after a few days of stratus
absence, it has made its return. "Fogust" anyone? That being said,
stratus will recede in the later morning to give way to clear
skies.

Additionally, a slight warmup begins today with inland temperatures
reaching into the 90s, and closer to the upper 80s around the SF
Bay. At the immediate coast, high temps will be in the 60s. Inland
temps will generally be around 5-10 degrees above normal as a ridge
of high pressure develops over the region. These warmer temperatures
last through Wednesday, and will bring moderate HeatRisk to just a
few interior portions of the CWA, otherwise HeatRisk is widely
minor. Otherwise, not expecting much in terms of the way of heat
impacts, and no heat products are necessitated at this time.

.LONG TERM...
(Wednesday through Monday)
Issued at 158 AM PDT Tue Aug 27 2024

Towards Thursday, inland high temperatures begin to reduce as the
ridge begins to flatten as a cutoff low approaches the region.
This low will bring cooler temperatures over the late part of the
workweek and into the weekend with highs close to seasonal
averages, if not slightly below. So hang in there; if you enjoyed
the cooler temperatures over the last few days, we`ve got a few
more in store for you later this week as we inch closer to the
start of meteorological fall, which "falls" on September 1st.
This being said, CPC outlooks place temperatures for our region
over the next 6-10 and 8-14 days in the "above normal" category.
However, taking a look at models in the extended, some place us on
the very periphery of a troughing regime, whereas others place us
just under the periphery of a ridge that develops over the 4
Corners region. Moving to cluster analysis, this seems to favor a
predominantly troughing pattern in the extended for our region,
which would usher in temperatures closer to seasonal averages, if
not slightly below average. This will be something to smooth out
in the the forecast in the coming days.

Issued at 428 AM PDT Tue Aug 27 2024

Moderate northwesterly winds continue with gustier winds in the
northern outer waters into the mid week. A building northwesterly
swell will cause rough seas to build over the northern outer
waters today. Seas and winds weaken into the second half of the
week, but winds look to would again into the next work week.
