   the weekend

 - Quiet weather for the holiday weekend

.SHORT TERM...
Issued at 331 AM PDT Thu Aug 28 2025
(Today and tonight)

Offshore marine layer stratus is once again slow to develop early
this Thursday morning. Persistent onshore flow continues to support
a 2000ft marine layer with a relatively weak vertical temperature
gradient, resulting in reduced stratus coverage than model guidance
progged due to reliance on climatology. The interruption of offshore
northwest surface flow should once again limit stratus redevelopment
late this afternoon and evening. Bumped temperatures up along the
coast from the Bay Area down to Monterey Bay to match closer to what
was realized the past couple of days.

.LONG TERM...
Issued at 331 AM PDT Thu Aug 28 2025
(Friday through Wednesday)

Friday will be similar to today before a subtle pattern change sets
in for the weekend. Expect one more day of interrupted stratus
coverage along the coast with near normal temperatures across the
interior. Low amplitude ridging for the weekend will result in
slightly warmer temperatures, with a return to near normal
temperatures for the beginning of next week. Increasing offshore
northwest surface flow returns Saturday, which will bring cooler
SST`s and increasing stratus development along the coast than we`ve
seen the last few days. However, the marine layer will compress,
limiting its inland penetration somewhat. Otherwise, sunny skies and
light winds for our interior locations through the extended
forecast.
