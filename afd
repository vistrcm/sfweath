...New AVIATION...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 332 AM PST Fri Jan 17 2025

Cool and quiet weather continues, with coastal and valley fog and
stratus being possible over the next couple of mornings. Offshore
winds look likely early next week, with the potential for these
winds to be strong.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 332 AM PST Fri Jan 17 2025

This morning residents of the Bay Area and Central Coast may be
greeted by fog and/or stratus or chilly morning lows. Satellite
this morning has been showing a slow invasion of stratus and fog
across much of the coast line with some inland penetration near
Marin County. Guidance suggests we should continue to see these
conditions advance inland,seeping farther into the North Bay Valleys
as well as the East Bay and South Bay valleys. The Central Coast
should fill in as well, and perhaps meander around the Monterey Bay.
Should these areas remain socked in with clouds, the high
temperature could be at risk by a few degrees. Then looking towards
tonight, we`ll likely have fog and stratus again. Perhaps sinking
into the Salinas Valley. Where fog and stratus sets up, we could
have temperatures remain warmer than expected. Adjusted temperatures
a few degrees warmer for North Bay, South Bay, and interior Monterey
County valleys with NBM90. Also upped temperatures around Monterey
Bay with NBM90 as well to account for lingering stratus.

.LONG TERM...
(Saturday through Thursday)
Issued at 332 AM PST Fri Jan 17 2025

Upper level ridging dominates the PacNW, while broad troughing sits
over much of the central US. Model and ensemble guidance depicts an
upper level low, which can currently be seen on satellite west of
Oregon and northern California, sliding south this weekend and then
southeast or east by early to mid next week. This won`t bring any
rain to the region, but it will bring cooler weather with it and
then the potential for offshore winds Monday into Tuesday. The ECMWF
and it`s ensembles remain the most bullish in terms of wind output
and pessimistic when it comes to gradient forecasts, while the GEFS
and other models, including the GEFS, are not. Opted to keep
highlighting gustier winds for the North Bay, monday into Tuesday.
Agree with the previous thinking that the higher terrain points up
there may see up to 35-40 mph gusts.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 343 AM PST Fri Jan 17 2025

Currently VFR at all TAF sites with the exception of HAF. Moderate
to high confidence in fog/stratus impacting all terminals at some
point this morning. Coastal locations have a greater chance of
remaining sub-VFR through the TAF period while inland locations are
expected to experience at least some reprieve in the afternoon.

Vicinity of SFO...Currently VFR with southwesterly flow. As winds
veer to become westerly, stratus will begin to fill in from the San
Bruno Gap. Moderate to high confidence in MVFR conditions through a
majority of the TAF period. Winds will veer further to become
easterly early Saturday morning.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...Currently VFR with drainage flow at both
terminals. An Otter Eddy within Monterey Bay will allow for a
healthy feed of stratus into both terminals this morning. High
confidence in MVFR conditions prevailing through the TAF period.

&&

.MARINE...
(Today through Wednesday)
Issued at 332 AM PST Fri Jan 17 2025

Moderate seas and moderate northwesterly breezes will prevail
through the week. High pressure will continue to support dry
conditions and low clouds overnight.
