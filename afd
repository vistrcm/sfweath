...New AVIATION, MARINE...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 250 AM PDT Sun Aug 13 2023

Morning low clouds will clear back to the coast by late morning
with mostly sunny skies and hotter inland temperatures this
afternoon with widespread 90s for the interior valleys. Partly
cloudy skies this evening before low clouds spread back inland.
Continued seasonably hot inland Monday through Wednesday with warm
weather near the coast and bays. The ridge breaks down by Friday
with a cooling trend into next weekend.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 250 AM PDT Sun Aug 13 2023

The marine layer has compressed to around 1500 feet with low
clouds spreading into the nearby coastal valleys while leftover
debris clouds from thunderstorm activity over the Sierra drifts
over the region. Cloud bases are only around 400-700 feet this
morning and dense fog is being reported at Half Moon Bay along the
coast. So as the sun comes up expect some drizzle and locally
dense fog for the Hwy 1 corridor and lower slopes. Main forecast
item of note today will be the noted warming trend inland as highs
warm into the mid and upper 90s east of Interstate 680, interior
Napa county and the interior Central Coast.

The SFO-Sac gradient is 2 mb and will stay onshore so temperatures
near the coast and bays will be mild to warm but no hot temps for
the major metro areas with San Jose staying in the upper 80s.

Expect more thunderstorms across the Sierra today as a large scale
upper low off the CA coast will continue to induce a moist
easterly flow. As storms come off the Sierra Crest and fall apart
this evening some debris clouds will make it into the Bay Area.
High pressure building to our north will keep the marine layer
compressed with warm overnight lows in the 70s for the North Bay
hills.

.LONG TERM...
(Monday through Saturday)
Issued at 250 AM PDT Sun Aug 13 2023

After morning low clouds peel back to the coast expect another
sunny and hot day inland with high into the upper 90s to lower
100s for the interior valleys. Onshore winds will keep the coast
and bays seasonably warm with heat risk remaining moderate.

Main item to monitor for Monday will be continued moist easterly
flow aloft with more thunderstorms over the Sierra. The last few
NAM model runs and our local WRF model generate some isolated
showers/thunderstorms over the higher terrain of San Benito
county Monday afternoon. That area will show a 15% chance of
precip with favorable (southeast) upslope flow and convergence
over the higher terrain. Elsewhere across the Bay Area
thunderstorm chances look less than 5% with best chances across
the mountains of Northern California Monday afternoon. Thus the
main weather concern will be continued seasonably hot weather
inland as places like Livermore will see 4-5 consecutive days
with highs around 100 degrees with the peak of the heat around
Tuesday into Weds.

The upper low that will linger well offshore most of the week will
move closer to the coast by Thursday with a slight decrease in
850 mb temps that will start the beginning of a cooling trend.
That trend will only be a few degrees of cooling Thursday. Further
and more noted inland cooling should ensue Friday into the
weekend as a longwave trough moves onto the West Coast.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 444 AM PDT Sun Aug 13 2023

Midlevel moisture continues to stream in from the Central Valley,
resulting in an influx of high clouds over the Bay Area, making it
difficult to see low clouds on the night fog satellite product.
Relative humidities have been increasing in the last few hours,
giving slightly more confidence that KSTS/KOAK could see brief
MVFR- IFR cigs before sunrise. This afternoon another round of
midlevel moisture wraps around the upper low, so more high clouds
and even a stray rain shower may move over the Bay Area (highest
confidence over the Eastern Santa Clara Hills) later tonight. Sea
breeze winds kick in this afternoon generally peaking around 10-15
knots across the region. Low to moderate confidence that low
clouds return tonight into Monday morning.

Vicinity of SFO...Difficult to see under high clouds passing over,
but patchy stratus is likely over the SF Bay. KSFO has been
oscillating between VFR and IFR. Not confident enough to make the
ceiling prevailing, so tempo included for IFR cigs. Vertical RH
profiles from high res guidance don`t look all that moist for SFO
this morning, but could still see intermittent low clouds move
over the terminal through sunrise. Low to moderate confidence low
clouds return early Monday morning with conflicting model guidance.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...LIFR conditions continue for the next few
hours as recent obs show reductions in visibilities to 1-3
statute miles. Patchy dense fog lowering to below 1 statute mile
possible over KMRY through 15z. Conditions will improve to MVFR
then eventually VFR this afternoon. Low clouds return late this
evening.

.MARINE...
(Today through Friday)
Issued at 247 AM PDT Sun Aug 13 2023

Northerly winds will increase briefly tonight over the northern
outer waters, resulting in low end small craft advisory wind
gusts through early morning Monday. Generally light winds are
expected across the coastal waters for much of the upcoming work
week, with the exception of the SF Bay becoming breezy each
afternoon. Moderate period southerly swell continues in addition
to a shorter period northwesterly swell. A new northwest swell
train arrives Tuesday this upcoming week, which will build then
diminish through the end of the week.

.MTR WATCHES/WARNINGS/ADVISORIES...
CA...None.
PZ...Small Craft Advisory from 3 PM this afternoon to 9 PM PDT this
     evening for PZZ530.

     Small Craft Advisory from 7 PM this evening to 9 AM PDT Monday
     for PZZ570.
