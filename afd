.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 204 AM PDT Fri Sep 29 2023

Upper will dig south into California today, which will bring
breezy to locally gusty onshore flow and cloudy conditions. Rain
showers associated with this system is expected to move through
Saturday morning, developing over the waters then moving inland
mostly south of the Bay Area. Rain chances diminish by Saturday
afternoon. Period of dry, northerly winds possible Sunday across
the interior. Warming trend is expected through the end of next
week.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 204 AM PDT Fri Sep 29 2023

Stronger 925 mb and 850 mb northerly winds are keeping the area
mostly dry and free of low clouds, per night fog satellite, with
the exception of some low clouds developing over the Monterey
Bay.

The big story for today is the upper low dropping down and digging
into CA. As the low moves in this afternoon, expect increasing
cloudiness and onshore winds. Wind gusts of 20 to 30 mph will be
widespread this afternoon as associated cold front approaches the
Bay Area. Strongest gusts of 40 mph are possible across higher
elevations as well as favored coastal gaps and mountain passes.
Light rain may start as early as tonight, but most rain is
expected to fall Saturday morning.

.LONG TERM...
(Saturday through Thursday)
Issued at 204 AM PDT Fri Sep 29 2023

Showers are expected to move through early Saturday morning
developing mostly south of the Golden Gate. Forecasted rainfall
amounts have been trending lower, but 40-70% PoPs from the SF
Peninsula southward persist. Forecast now calls for 0.10"-0.25" for
the Santa Cruz Mtns, Diablo Range, and Santa Lucias. Lower
elevations of the Bay Area will most likely see a few hundredths
of an inch while the Central Coast will get closer to 0.10". North
Bay likely won`t see much rain from this initial push, but may
get some light precip on the backside of the surface low Sat
afternoon.

While the chance was already small, it`s looking less likely for
thunderstorms now across the southern Monterey/San Benito counties.
NBM has reduced the chance of thunder to a 5-10% chance. Forecast
CAM soundings for the southern cwa are not looking overly
impressive either, with shallow MUCAPE ~100-150 J/kg on Saturday
morning. However, still can`t rule out a rumble of thunder or two
or a cell that has higher rain rates. Rain chances across the
Central Coast diminish by Sat afternoon, but some lingering post-
frontal showers possible.

Upper low will move east into the Great Basin Sun-Mon, which will
prompt strong ridge from the E Pacific to nudge in. During this
transitionary period, breezy northerly winds will set up across
the Sac Valley and interior portions of our area (E Napa Co, East
Bay Hills, Diablo Range) Sunday morning-afternoon. Lingering
northerly winds are also possible Monday, but strongest N winds
expected Sun. Models continue to get a handle on how much
moisture/qpf we will get, so lower confidence in regards to fire
wx risk for now.

High pressure will continue to build next week, becoming the
dominant synoptic feature over much of the western US. This
pattern change which will prompt a warming trend through the end
of the week with widespread onshore flow and a more robust marine
layer will redeveloping.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 451 AM PDT Fri Sep 29 2023

VFR conditions continue to prevail for terminals north of Monterey
Bay and KAPC where VIS have become IFR criteria. Expect stratus to
build as the frontal system moves over our region today bringing a
chance for MVFR ceilings for most terminals. If MVFR ceilings occur,
expect near 06Z, except for Monterey Bay where MVFR ceilings are
expected to persist for KMRY and to return near 23Z near the Salinas
Valley. Chances for drizzle/light showers is possible for terminals
near 06Z today. The system will also bring some onshore breezy and
gusty winds near the terminals, especially near the coastal gaps and
deltas.

Vicinity of SFO...VFR conditions continue with light onshore winds.
VFR is expected to prevail through most of the TAF period, with
chances for MVFR ceilings and light showers near 06z, associated
with the frontal system. Winds are expected to become breezy and
gusting up to 18-20 knots near the afternoon and will remain breezy
through the TAF period.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...MVFR as ceiling continue to build and
lower. KMRY is expected to remain MVFR through the TAF period,
whereas KSNS may experience lower CIGs to IFR this morning then
stratus may lift to VFR criteria near 16Z before returning to
MVFR. Expect some light rain/drizzle later tonight near 06Z.
Onshore winds are expected to become breezy in the afternoon and
returning to moderate tonight.

.MARINE...
(Today through Wednesday)
Issued at 451 AM PDT Fri Sep 29 2023

Gale-force northwesterly winds ease through the night slowly,
becoming fresh into late Friday morning, to the early afternoon.
Northwest swell continues to diminish, though large wind waves
continue to build as a result of gales and persist through the
weekend. Both winds and waves will combine to create hazardous
conditions for small craft through the remainder of the week.
Chances of rain approach towards Friday evening with the arrival
of a new low pressure system.
