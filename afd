.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 1201 AM PDT Thu Mar 27 2025

An impressive surface low is located northwest of California just
offshore of the border of Northern California and Oregon. A trailing
cold front associated with this low is pushing southwards into the
Bay Area and Central Coast. This system has helped push upper level
ridging eastward away from the West Coast and helped bring our high
temperatures down closer to seasonal averages (if not a few degrees
below average). High temperatures across the interior will be in the
low to mid 60s while highs along the coastline will be in the upper
50s to low 60s today. Comparatively, low temperatures this morning
are running about 5 to 10 degrees above normal in the mid 40s to mid
50s. A look at satellite data shows widespread overcast skies which
act to trap heat/reduce radiational cooling at the surface and
results in warmer morning low temperatures than normal.

KMUX is showing light rain entering the Bay Area and Central Coast
with a few sites in Santa Cruz and San Mateo Counties reporting a
few hundredths of an inch. Totals are locally higher across the
North Bay where drizzly conditions persisted much of yesterday.
Light rain continues through the rest of the day into Friday for the
North Bay and coastal Bay Area counties. Totals from this event
won`t be too impressive, with most sites south of the Golden Gate
seeing up to a quarter of an inch and up to half an inch across
the North Bay. On a slightly more impactful level, gusty winds are
expected again today across the region with widespread gusts
between 20 to 30 mph and gusts up to 35 mph along elevated
terrain. The KSFO-KWMC (Winnemucca, NV) forecast pressure
gradient shows the forecast gradient strengthening to +15 mb to
+16 mb Thursday afternoon which is reflective of strong onshore
winds across the Bay Area. This is supported by probabilistic NBM
guidance which places the highest confidence in widespread gusts
between 20 to 30 mph. Peaks and ridgelines have a low (generally
