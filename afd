.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 115 AM PST Fri Jan 12 2024

Rain and wind return late Friday through Saturday as a cold front
moves over the region. Fair weather will return early next week
with warming temperatures by midweek.

&&

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 115 AM PST Fri Jan 12 2024

A somewhat amplified flow pattern exists over the eastern Pacific as
a shortwave crests a high pressure ridge centered halfway between
Hawaii and Mexico. This pattern is providing northwest flow across
the West Coast with clouds extending from the Pacific Northwest,
through NorCal, and into the Great Basin. For today this upper
moisture feed will keep plentiful high cloud cover in place which
should temper surface heating this afternoon. Still expect
temperatures to rebound into the 50s after a chilly start but with a
light onshore breeze it definitely won`t feel overly mild. By
tonight robust warm advection will exist from the Bay Area north
into Oregon with frontogenetic forcing providing sufficient lift for
mainly light rainfall overnight. This is reflected in the convection
allowing models which suggest warm advection rain may develop in the
North Bay as early as 06Z on Saturday. That said, the core of the
better rain looks to hold off until the daylight hours on
Saturday. Overnight temperatures should be a bit milder
considering the cloud cover and onshore winds but should still dip
into the 40s with some 30s in the colder interior parts of the
Central Coast.

.LONG TERM...
(Saturday through Thursday)
Issued at 115 AM PST Fri Jan 12 2024

Saturday and Saturday Night:

The Bay Area and Central Coast will initially remain within the
warm advection wing associated with surface low pressure offshore
and a warm front along the CA/OR border. As richer moisture
(~1.2" precipitable water values) advects onshore this should
provide an uptick in light to moderate rainfall rates across the
Bay Area during the mid to late morning hours. The rain will
gradually spread south through the remainder of the Bay Area and
Central Coast during the afternoon and evening as the surface cold
front attendant to the offshore low pushes south. Rain totals
will be greatest in the North Bay where 2- 3" is likely in the
Coastal Ranges with 1-1.5" in the Valleys. Totals could also reach
1-2" in the Santa Cruz Mountains. Elsewhere amounts will
generally be 0.5-1" across the Bay Area with 0.5" or less for
southern Monterey Bay and Big Sur. The inland Central Coast will
generally see 0.25" or less, with very little rain expected the
farther you go inland. Outside of rain, a decent 35-40 kt westerly
low-level jet will accompany this system so expect winds to be
breezy to gusty along the coast, through the favorable gaps and
passes, and in the hills. Given the expected progressive nature of
this system precipitation should end for all but the Central
Coast by the late night hours. Despite the cloud cover warm
advection should allow afternoon readings on Saturday to be a bit
milder with highs mostly in the upper 50s to around 60. Overnight
temperatures should remain seasonally warm as well with lows
generally in the 40s.

Sunday through Thursday:

Outside of lingering AM showers on Sunday the extended pattern is
looking mostly benign outside of some light rain on Wednesday.
High pressure at the surface and aloft will provide for cool
mornings and mild afternoons with high level clouds around at
times. Temperatures look rather pleasant by week`s end with highs
mostly in the 60s and lows in the 40s to around 50.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS) Issued at 350 AM PST FRI Jan 12 2024

Th North Bay will see reduced visibility this morning from
isolated pockets of mist and fog while other areas stay in VFR.
Winds stay mostly light to moderate, peaking in the afternoon, but
most areas look to stay below 10 knots. Winds become light again
into late Friday night with building mid and lower level clouds.
MVFR CIGs build Saturday morning ahead of the next widespread
rainmaker.

Vicinity of SFO...VFR with passing high clouds. Expect increasing
mid level clouds and chances for pre-frontal showers late Friday
night. Winds look to remain light to moderate through the TAF
period. Better rain chances and breezier winds arrive along a
cold front just beyond the TAF period.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO

Monterey Bay Terminals...VFR through the TAF Period. Winds look to
stay light until moderate northwest winds build into Friday
afternoon. Expect light winds and mid level clouds into Friday night
with scattered lower clouds.

.MARINE...
(Today through Wednesday)
Issued at 350 AM PST Fri Jan 12 2024

Winds continue to weaken today with a moderate northwest swell
prevailing. A cold front will bring rain and breezy to gusty winds
across the waters Saturday with a longer northwest swell following
it. Drier weather returns early in the week, with light rain
expected in the mid week.
