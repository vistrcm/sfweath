...New AVIATION...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 252 AM PDT Thu Jul 27 2023

The San Francisco & Monterey Bay regions remain under the
influence of onshore flow and the marine layer. Coastal stratus
will largely impact our forecast area with overnight and morning
low clouds. Onshore winds will become breezy in the afternoon and
evening hours. With the cooling influence of the marine
environment, daytime highs will generally be near to below normal
now into the weekend.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 252 AM PDT Thu Jul 27 2023

Stratus is a bit patchy over land as of 3 to 4 am, but the trend
indicates the low clouds will be filling in as we approach
sunrise. The Fort Ord Profiler is currently around 1200 ft deep
while the Bodega Bay Profiler is approaching 1600 ft. The
deepening marine layer has led to a cooling trend in the past 24
hours while humidity values are on an increasing (moister) trend.
ECMWF, GFS, and NAM models are once again showing another vort max
tracking across the North Bay this afternoon. Thus, the marine
layer should stay above 1000 ft today and will likely gradually
deepen a bit more.

Onshore winds should pick up this afternoon which is typical when
we`re largely influenced by the marine layer. Afternoon highs
closer to the coast will range in the upper 50s to upper 70s while
the interior ranges in the 80s to 90s with a few of the "hot
spots" (like Parkfield) getting into the low 100s. Then marine
stratus clouds will push inland again tonight.

.LONG TERM...
(Friday through Wednesday)
Issued at 252 AM PDT Thu Jul 27 2023

The long term outlook doesn`t offer too much change from prior
discussions. Our CWA will be sitting between an upper level trough
extending from Western Canada and into NorCal while high pressure
continues to dominate the southern US. Initially, the trough will
be slightly more dominant now into the start of the weekend as we
will be in a cooling trend...however, the high seems to strengthen
slightly by Sunday and build back towards CA which is forecast to
bump up temperatures on Sunday into Monday. Then the high drifts
eastward again allowing the trough to our north to put the region
back into a slight cooling trend. Regardless of these subtle
synoptic changes, most locations within our CWA will only notice
minor oscillations in the temperatures for the long term outlook.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 453 AM PDT Thu Jul 27 2023

Currently a mix between VFR, MVFR, IFR, and LIFR. A few
terminals inland has gotten some VFR relieve but most terminals are
still in the process of stratus lifting. Satellite shows another
band of stratus moving south along the coast creating some
uncertainty on stratus ceiling and timing of clearing. Although the
marine layer has deepened, there is a sufficient amount of moisture
in the air, creating lower cigs and some visibility issues (mostly
for Monterey Bay). Any stratus formed over the terminals, are
expected to clear around 16-18Z as diurnal heating takes into
effect. With the "tug of war" of the trough and ridge over our
region, anticipating stratus return and heights is a bit uncertain
for tonight but models suggest another round of stratus creating a
mix of MVFR/IFR/LIFR stratus for most coastal terminals starting
tonight. Onshore winds are expected to become breezy with coastal
gaps becoming gusty this afternoon with a return of moderate to
light winds tonight.

Vicinity of SFO...VFR but stratus still surrounds the terminal near
the coast. Therefore, it is possible for moments of MVFR ceilings
this morning but had low confidence to declare MVFR as prevailing so
TEMPOs were placed. Expect VFR to prevail through the remainder of
the TAF period after 16-17Z. Breezy and gusty onshore winds are
expected in the afternoon with winds returning to moderate late
tonight.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...LIFR as stratus is pretty socked over both
terminals with expected lifting near 17Z. Winds are expected to
remain onshore and light/moderate through the TAF period for KMRY as
KSNS will experience some breezy winds in the afternoon before
returning to light/moderate tonight. IFR/LIFR CIGs are expected to
return tonight with moderate confidence on exact heights and timing.

.MARINE...
(Today through Tuesday)
Issued at 252 AM PDT Thu Jul 27 2023

As gusty northwest winds are forecast over the coastal waters
through early next week, the resulting wind waves will create
hazardous conditions for small crafts. Light southerly swell
mixing with a northwest swell will persist through early next
week.

.MTR WATCHES/WARNINGS/ADVISORIES...
CA...None.
PZ...Small Craft Advisory from 9 AM this morning to 9 PM PDT this
     evening for PZZ535-560.
