.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 304 AM PST Tue Nov 19 2024

A strong atmospheric river will bring heavy rain and strong winds
to the Bay Area starting tonight, with impacts extending through
the weekend. The worst impacts will be felt in the North Bay,
where more than a month`s worth of rain will fall over the next
3-4 days.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 304 AM PST Tue Nov 19 2024

High clouds are streaming across the cwa, limiting radiational
cooling and keeping the surface temperature a couple degrees warmer
than we anticipated at this hour, but still 5-10 degrees cooler than
average, and frost/freeze products are in effect for much of the
interior through 8 AM. That said, the northern Salinas Valley is
proving resilient, and remains in the low to mid 40s at this
hour. After the sun comes up, southerly winds will gradually
increase through the day as the explosive cyclogenesis gets
underway off the coast of the Pacific Northwest. Winds will reach
20-30 mph with gust to 45 mph across the North Bay, Bay Shore and
Peninsula Coast including the city of San Francisco. Rain will
also begin in the North Bay overnight, spreading south with
increasing intensity through the night.

.LONG TERM...
(Wednesday through Monday)
Issued at 304 AM PST Tue Nov 19 2024

Impacts and timeline:

By the time the sun comes up Wednesday (or when the clouds become a
slightly lighter shade of dark grey) the North Bay will be dealing
with heavy rain, which will taper off with decreasing latitude and
only light rain is expected south of San Jose or Santa Cruz. In the
North Bay specifically, there may also be some flooding of small
creeks and streams, as well as a few downed branches and trees in
the strong overnight wind. It looks nasty all day with strong wind
and heavy rain continuing. This is especially true north of the
Golden Gate, but Wednesday will be an impactful day across much of
the Bay Area. There is a brief reprieve on Thursday, but only in
comparison to Wednesday. It will still be raining for the majority
of the day, and again focused in the North Bay. The winds should
improve below advisory criteria on Thursday, but only just. The cold
front will finally push through Friday with another push of heavier
rain and stronger wind ahead of frontal passage and stronger showers
and potential thunderstorms during and after frontal passage. For
areas south of San Francisco, this will likely bring the heaviest
rainfall of the week. The cumulative effects of this rain will start
to be felt along the North Bay creeks and streams. The California
Nevada River Forecast Center shows a 25% chance of Mark West Creek
reaching minor flood stage and a 5% chance of reaching moderate. The
larger rivers are not expected to approach flooding levels this
week, but will rise substantially from their seasonal hibernation.
For example, the Russian River at Guerneville stage is currently
measured at 5.6 ft and forecast to climb above 20 feet by
Saturday. Fortunately the flood stage here starts at 32 feet.
Since the big rivers are starting with a lot of capacity, the
flooding concern is focused on the smaller, flashier creeks and
streams throughout the North Bay, as well as ponding on roadways
and low-lying flood prone urban areas. The conditions will finally
begin to improve going into the weekend, but persistent lighter
rain looks to continue well into next week.

Meteorology:

Let`s put this "explosive cyclogenesis" or "bomb cyclone" in
perspective. The Ocean Prediction Center analyzed the central
pressure to be 1011 mb at 19/00Z. The 24 hour forecast dropped the
pressure to 943 mb by 20/00Z. A drop of 68 mb in 24 hours. So
what? At this storm`s latitude (43N), A cyclone needs to drop 19
mb in 24 hours to classify as "bomb cyclone". Again the OPC is
forecasting a 68 mb drop. That equates to 3.6 Bergeron units.
Easily passing the benchmark for a "triple bomb". In fact, if the
forecast holds, 943 mb is approaching the lowest pressure ever
analyzed in this part of the ocean and may produce historic wind
speeds. The Medford, OR Office has issued a very rare Hurricane
Force Wind Warning for coastal waters from Tuesday morning through
Wednesday morning. In their AFD, Medford notes this type of storm
comes around once a decade or so. While this paragraph
demonstrates the strength of this cyclone, the worst impacts will
stay north of the Bay Area.

How much rain are we expecting? There is surprisingly good agreement
in the model guidance that this will be a major rain maker for the
North Bay. The ECMWF ensemble shows a 90% chance that Santa Rosa
will see more than 4" of rain this week. That`s pretty unusual to
have such high confidence in getting at least a month`s worth of
rain over a few days. There is some spread between the floor and
ceiling, with a 10% chance of Santa Rosa getting over 10" from Wed-
Fri. If the high end verifies, that would approach the highest 3 day
total ever recorded at Santa Rosa (9.96" from Oct 24-26 2021,
records going back to 1902). There will be a pretty sharp gradient
with less rain further south on Wednesday and Thursday. As the
parent cyclone occludes and weakens and the cold front becomes
the dominate player, the rain will be more evenly disturbed Fri-
Sat. By the end of the week nearly everyone can expect at least
an inch or 2 in their rain gauge.

The best chance for thunderstorms is on Friday as the cold front
and new triple point low come ashore in northern California.
History has taught us that this type of "landfalling" occlusion has
the potential to generate strong thunderstorms in our area.

Regarding the new wind advisory, we are continuing to blend 50/50
NBM with NBM90 to effectively bump up the deterministic wind
speeds. Why? The deterministic NBM is lagging behind other short
range guidance and all bias corrected models struggle with extreme
events. While these winds aren`t necessarily extreme, this
synoptic pattern is, and that is likely not being captured well
in the deterministic NBM.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 327 AM PST Tue Nov 19 2024

MVFR cigs beginning this afternoon and evening for terminals in
the North Bay and parts of the Bay Area. In addition to low cigs,
gusty S winds to 20-30 kts will begin this evening for all
terminals from KSJC northward. -RA/VCSH expected to begin this
evening for North Bay terminals, and VCSH for Bay Area terminals
by the end of the 30 hr TAF period Wednesday morning. High
confidence in cigs and RA for the North Bay. Lower confidence for
Bay Area terminals as they will be on the edge of the heavier
precip to the north. Elsewhere, dry through the TAF period with
OVC high clouds.

Vicinity of SFO...VFR through the TAF period, but lower confidence
headed into the overnight hours tonight and into Wednesday
morning. Most impactful will be the gusty S winds around 35 kts
beginning this evening and persisting through Wednesday afternoon.
High confidence in the wind impacts. VCSH and RA begin to impact
the terminal area by Wednesday morning, with more intense rainfall
expected Wednesday afternoon.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...Much less impactful weather for Monterey
Bay terminals with this issuance. Fairly typical diurnal winds
with onshore during the afternoon and light SE drainage flow
overnight. VFR through the TAF period with plentiful high clouds.

.MARINE...
(Tonight through next Sunday)
Issued at 959 PM PST Mon Nov 18 2024

Seas remain elevated while winds temporarily ease overnight.
Hazardous marine conditions will return Tuesday as strong
southerly  breezes and widespread gale-force gusts develop ahead
of an  approaching bomb cyclone. Seas will build as this system
approaches  with rough seas returning Tuesday and continuing
through Friday.  While wave heights will generally peak between 10
to 16 feet, the  northern outer waters may see wave heights peak
closer to 20 feet.  Expect heavy rain beginning late Tuesday and
increasing thunderstorm  chances Thursday into the weekend.
