...New FIRE WEATHER...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 209 AM PST Tue Nov 5 2024

Critical fire weather conditions today through Thursday. A Red Flag
Warning is in effect from 11 AM today through 7 AM Thursday.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 209 AM PST Tue Nov 5 2024

A Red Flag Warning is in effect for all interior Bay Area Zones, as
well as the city of San Francisco, the San Francisco Peninsula
Coast, the Bay Shoreline, and higher terrain of Central Coast from
11 AM today through 7 AM Thursday as strong offshore winds and
critically dry conditions are expected to develop. Fire weather
conditions will deteriorate throughout the day as high pressure
builds into the Pacific Northwest, a cold front plunges southward
across the area, and a reinforcing trough begins to dig into the
Four Corners. As the surface pressure gradient tightens throughout
the day it will support widespread strong northerly (drying) winds
of 20-30 mph in bayside, coastal, and valley locations. The 925 mb
pressure gradient will be supportive for strong offshore winds with
gusts up to 50 mph in higher terrain, across ridgelines, and through
gaps and passes. A Wind Advisory is in effect from 4 PM today
through 3 PM Wednesday for the North Bay Interior Mountains for
offshore winds of 30-40 mph with gusts up to 60 mph. Isolated
locations like Mt. St. Helena will likely see gusts of 70+ mph.
Today will bring the driest conditions this week with widespread
critical (15% or less) relative humidities everywhere except the
immediate North Bay Coast and the immediate Southern Monterey Bay
Coast. The SFO-WMC pressure gradient is currently +0.6 mb (onshore)
and is expected to reverse and become offshore early this morning.
Guidance/models are suggesting that it will strengthen throughout
the day and peak around -15.0 mb overnight so expect the strongest
offshore winds of this event to occur then.

.LONG TERM...
(Wednesday through Monday)
Issued at 209 AM PST Tue Nov 5 2024

Winds will begin to diminish Wednesday afternoon, but poor-to-no
overnight relative humidity recovery preceding critical (15% or
less) daytime relative humidity will allow for critical fire weather
conditions to linger through Thursday morning. Global ensemble
clusters are in agreement that the cutoff low responsible for the
critical fire weather conditions will slowly begin to progress east
by Thursday. The region will remain under the influence of the
positively tilted ridge through Friday with a pair of troughs
looking to renew rain chances Saturday and Monday.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 324 AM PST Tue Nov 5 2024

A shallow cloud deck will persist over the coastal waters ahead of
an approaching cold front. Impacts from the low cigs will be at
KHAF, KSFO, and KMRY. The fropa is on target for later this
morning, which will scour out the low cigs. Behind the front
offshore flow will kick in drying out the boundary layer with VFR.
However, offshore flow will lead to LLWS for many Bay Area
terminals tonight and early Wednesday.

Vicinity of SFO...A few cigs around 004 feet sneaking in from the
NW through the gap will linger through about 14Z. Otherwise vfr
with LLWS later today.

SFO Bridge Approach...VFR.

Monterey Bay Terminals...shallow cigs bumping against the
terminal at KMRY through about 15Z today. Otherwise, vfr by this
afternoon.

.MARINE...
(Today through Sunday)
Issued at 324 AM PST Tue Nov 5 2024

Gusty northerly winds will persist over the coastal waters due to
high pressure off the Pacific Northwest coast and low pressure
over Southern California. Winds will be strongest over the outer
waters and north of Pigeon Point. The strong winds will result in
steep wind waves and fresh swell. By late week, wave heights
begin to decrease and the sea state becomes relatively calm.

.FIRE WEATHER...
Issued at 408 AM PST Tue Nov 5 2024

First and foremost, no changes to Red Flag Warning currently in
effect. Why the Red Flag Warning? Gusty offshore flow with
plummeting humidity values over the next 24 hours. The other
component needed for RFW is low 10hr fuel moisture, more on that
later. As noted above the offshore gradient from SFO-WMC is
forecast to be around -15mb. Definitely decent for October, but
comparing it to 2017 Wine Country and 2019 Kincade fire not quite
there. Those two events were in the upper teens to near -20mb for
gradients. Regardless still winds in the hills will be gusty. How
about mix down and hydraulic jumps? Not so much this time.
X-section through the N Bay Mts does show mountain waves are
possible early Wednesday, but not seeing a lot of momentum
transfer to the valley or waves "rolling" off the hills to the
valleys. In other words, strong winds highest peaks, but not
extreme. A passing front will usher in much lower humidity values.
Latest hi-res meso models show potential for RH values dropping to
the upper single digits. Didn`t fully go all in on that, but
definitely undercut current forecast by 10-15%. Circling back to
the fuels - the last round of rain took a bite out of the ERC and
100 hour fuels values, which isn`t all that surprising. Rain,
higher RH, longer nights, cooler days, etc. BI values on the other
hand are more influenced by wind and they are hitting critical
values given the forecast. A quick sampling of automated 10hr
fuels (good carry of fire) are marginal with values in the 8-15%
during peak heating. All that being said, not a major RFW and
probably on the lower end given recent rains. Still strong enough
to warrant some concerns nonetheless.
