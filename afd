...New AVIATION, MARINE...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 1208 AM PDT Thu Aug 1 2024

Warm temps here to stay through the forecast period. Monsoonal
moisture set to enter the area by Friday, resulting in a low
chance for dry lightning Friday evening into Saturday.

&&

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 1208 AM PDT Thu Aug 1 2024

Initial hints of mid-to-upper level moisture making itself
apparent in the form of high clouds moving over the area
overnight. A bit more mixing thus far overnight as well, so some
of the marine stratus may be a bit more thin in terms of coverage
this morning despite the marine layer remaining below about 1,000
feet. High temps today once again add on a couple of degrees to
yesterday`s highs, but overall HeatRisk is still mostly in the
minor category, which primarily affects individuals who are
extremely sensitive to heat.

.LONG TERM...
(Friday through Wednesday)
Issued at 1208 AM PDT Thu Aug 1 2024

Temperatures really don`t change much through the rest of the
forecast period. Ensemble guidance strongly supports holding on to
this pattern where we bounce around roughly 4-8 degrees above
normal for at least the next 7 days. Areas in the interior East
Bay, South Bay, and interior Central Coast will begin to see
moderate HeatRisk by the end of the weekend, not necessarily due
to the magnitude of the heat, but rather many consecutive days
above normal. With the risk of heat-related impacts remaining
limited, we are still holding off on the issuance of any
hazards.

Once again, the bigger story will be the (low) potential for dry
lightning late Friday into Saturday morning. Not too many notable
changes in this forecast either. Guidance still depicting a well
advertised plume of monsoonal moisture moving up from the south
across the state. The centroid of the plume still looks to be
tracking roughly over the Sierra, and most accompanying
instability will likely follow suit. We still don`t have enough
confidence to message any more than a 1-5% chance of dry
lightning, especially over eastern portions of our area that
border the Central Valley. Wind over land still looks to be
mostly diurnal and terrain driven, so we aren`t expecting any
widespread impacts relating to fire weather aside from critically
dry fuels and the non-zero chance of dry lightning.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 421 AM PDT Thu Aug 1 2024

IFR-LIFR ceilings are being reported across the North Bay valleys,
the SF Bay and Monterey Bay regions, and the Salinas Valley. A band
of high clouds is making the exact distribution of stratus
uncertain, and potentially hints at lower level mixing that may be
inhibiting more widespread stratus coverage. This is best seen in
the South Bay with a lower confidence for ceilings at SJC this
morning, and the interior East Bay with LVK expected to remain clear
through the TAF period. Stratus will retreat to the immediate coast
later this morning. Breezy onshore winds develop in the afternoon
before weakening in the evening as the stratus deck begins to expand
through the end of the TAF period.

Vicinity of SFO... Patchy IFR-LIFR stratus has finally settled over
the terminal and is expected to persist for the rest of the morning.
West-northwest winds up to 20 knots will develop in the afternoon,
with stratus returning to the terminal later this evening through
Friday morning.

SFO Bridge Approach... Stratus has impacted the approach path and
should clear later in the morning. Otherwise similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals... Generally extensive LIFR stratus through
the late morning hours with patchy fog possible until sunrise.
Breezy onshore winds in the afternoon with stratus returning in the
evening.

.MARINE...
(Today through Tuesday)
Issued at 421 AM PDT Thu Aug 1 2024

Gentle to moderate northwesterly breezes with fresh gusts will
prevail today. By Friday, a tightening pressure gradient will
allow for gusts to strengthen to a strong breeze. Significant
wave heights will hover in the 6-8 feet range through the forecast
period. While not forecast to be of impact to our area, Tropical
Storm Carlotta, along with two other disturbances, are churning in
the Eastern Pacific. We will continue to monitor to see if future
hazards are needed.
