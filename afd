...New SYNOPSIS, SHORT TERM, LONG TERM...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 436 AM PST Sun Dec 17 2023

A gale force low pressure system has stalled about 780 miles WSW of
San Francisco. Outer rain bands associated with this feature will
bring light rain to the Bay Area today.

&&

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 436 AM PST Sun Dec 17 2023

High clouds are quickly building across the region as the radar
begins to pick up some showers off the coast. Some of these cells
look moderately strong with reflectivities in the 40-50 dBZ range
and a few lightning strikes. The stronger cells will likely stay
over the ocean, though we can`t rule out a stronger cell or two
over the North Bay later today. Otherwise, light rain showers will
generally arrive in the morning and persist through the day. The
more widespread convection looks to hold off until early Monday
morning. As the southerly flow ahead of the cold front increases
the warm air advection, temperatures will be noticeably above
average again today. The building overcast skies and light rain
should keep any daily records safe, however. The dewpoint will
also rise due to the tropical airmass and evaporation of
precipitation. This added moisture will prime the atmosphere for
the main event Monday.

.LONG TERM...
(Monday through Saturday)
Issued at 436 AM PST Sun Dec 17 2023

Monday:

The strongest convection will arrive early Monday morning. The
fuel will be the increase moisture from Sunday`s rain and the
trigger will be a passing warm front. It`s hard to pin down where
the strongest showers will be. The NAM and HRRR are showing
strong signals in the North Bay starting in the pre-dawn hours.
Some lower-resolution guidance is suggesting the mountains of
Santa Cruz and Monterey counties will get the most rain instead.
Due to the convective, showery nature of this event, the
uncertainty likely wont be ironed out until the showers get into
radar range Sunday night. Depending on how much moisture can build
through the day Sunday, there is a slight to moderate chance that
some of the Monday showers could strengthen into thunderstorms.
Regardless, most of the Bay Area can expect about an inch of
accumulation on Monday alone. The exception is in the Santa Clara
Valley, where the southerly flow into the Santa Cruz mountains
will create a rain shadow effect. This will cause enhanced
precipitation on the windward side (Santa Cruz) and suppressed
precipitation on the leeward side (Santa Clara Valley). A similar
effect will occur in the Salinas Valley. Monday will also bring
strong southerly winds to coastal areas and any inland valleys
with a S or SE exposure. Gale force winds are possible along the
coast in Big Sur from Point Lobos to Point Sur.

Tuesday through Thursday:

By Tuesday, the stronger showers and wind gusts will subside as the
low pressure finally lifts NE towards the Pacific Northwest. Lighter
rain will continue through Wednesday, however, as a new low-pressure
trough forms on the west side of the parent low and gets a
slingshot-like boost towards southern California. Due to the
complex interaction between these systems, the uncertainty is high
for the second half of the week. Most likely the new low will
stay south of our area, causing only light lingering showers south
of San Mateo County on Thursday while the Los Angeles area gears
up for significant rain.

By the time the rain ends Wednesday or Thursday, most of the Bay
Area should have recorded 2-3 inches for the week. With rain
spread out over multiple days, this will mainly be a beneficial
event. Since October 1st, Downtown San Francisco has recorded 2.38
inches of rain. In an average water year (begins Oct 1st), that
amount would be 6.54 inches through December 17th. Out of the 173
years of daily precipitation measurements, this year has been the
26th driest so far. 2-3 inches would go a long way towards making
up the deficit.

Friday and beyond:

Drier weather returns Friday and looks to persist through the
holiday weekend. Some long range guidance is hinting at the
potential for an atmospheric river to set up by the middle of next
week, but that`s stretching the models to their useful limit. Still
something to keep an eye on.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 400 AM PST Sun Dec 17 2023

Scattered showers now lurking offshore will be in the vicinity of
the Bay Area terminals around 16-21Z. On-station impacts should
be limited to wet runways and brief visibility reductions in
SHRA/-SHRA. Scattered showers will persist today with lower
confidence in airfield impacts heading into the late afternoon and
evening. Conditions go downhill late tonight into Monday as a low
pressure system and front approach the region. This will provide
sub-VFR conditions, gusty winds and LLWS, along with numerous
showers. Rain chances increase around 08-10Z with peak impacts
from around 15Z through the end of the TAF period. Low
predictability precludes VCTS in the current TAFs, however its
inclusion may become necessary with future updates depending upon
convective trends.

Vicinity of SFO...Scattered showers offshore will be in the
vicinity around 16-21Z. Wet runways and brief visibility
reductions are possible should a shower impact the airfield. Less
confidence in seeing showers this afternoon and evening however
will keep a VCSH mention. Conditions go downhill late tonight
(~08-10Z) with numerous showers, sub-VFR conditions, and LLWS.
VCTS may become necessary with future TAF updates but for now
confidence in occurrence is too low for inclusion.

SFO Bridge Approach... Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...Scattered showers offshore will be in the
vicinity around 18-22Z. Low confidence in on-station impacts, but
they would likely be limited to wet runways and brief visibility
reductions in -SHRA. Conditions go downhill after the current TAF
period with sub-VFR conditions and numerous showers likely by
Monday morning.

.MARINE...
(Today through Friday)
Issued at 341 AM PST Sun Dec 17 2023

Winds build overnight as as a low pressure system approaches the
outer waters. The system will bring breezy to gusty southerly
winds along with scattered to numerous rain showers today into
Monday. Shower chances will the persist through late week. A few
thunderstorms are possible today into Monday with lightning and
gale-force gusts being the primary hazards. In addition to wind
and thunderstorm hazards, a large southwest swell will arrive
tonight along with the storm system.
