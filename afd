.SHORT TERM...
Issued at 1244 AM PST Fri Nov 7 2025
(Today and tonight)

Satellite imagery reveals low clouds across the North Bay valleys,
with scattered stratus extending down into parts of San Francisco
and the western side of Oakland, with additional patches across
central San Benito County to the south of Hollister. Farther afield,
a weak cold front is coming through the North Coast and will keep
together just long enough to bring a chance for light rain across
the western parts of the North Bay this morning, particularly the
Sonoma coastal ranges and the Mayacamas, with chances for
orographically-induced showers extending as far south as the Half
Moon Bay region. Accumulations will be light, around a few
hundredths of an inch at most.

Light offshore flow has also developed across the higher elevations
of the Central Coast, with northeasterly winds  at the 925 mb level.
As for the Bay Area, the SFO-WMC gradient was +4.2 mb as of
midnight, and remains generally onshore through the late afternoon
and evening hours today. This timeframe is also when the 925 mb
winds will turn towards the northeast. In any case, fire weather
concerns remain low with the fire weather indices remaining below
seasonal averages.

All of this is a long-winded way of saying that there is little to
no significant sensible weather concerns for today, with the upper
level pattern transitioning from more zonal flow to a ridging
pattern through the day. Morning low clouds across the Bay Area will
retreat to the immediate coast into the afternoon. High temperatures
reach the lower to middle 70s across the inland valleys, up to the
upper 70s in the southern Salinas Valley, with the Bays seeing highs
in the upper 60s to lower 70s and the lower 60s prevailing across
the Pacific Coast.

.LONG TERM...
Issued at 1244 AM PST Fri Nov 7 2025
(Saturday through Thursday)

The ridge will build into the weekend, and will contribute to more
general offshore flow across the region, resulting in clear skies
and temperatures warmer than the seasonal average through Monday.
Highs across the inland valleys reach the middle 70s to the middle
80s with the Bays seeing highs in the lower 70s to the lower 80s,
and mid to upper 60s prevailing at the coast. The thermal belts will
also activate with mild overnight lows in the higher elevations
Saturday morning through Tuesday morning.

Monday night into Tuesday will mark the start of the ridge eroding,
allowing a deep upper level low to form in the east Pacific and
impact the West Coast beginning Wednesday. All model guidance
generally agrees that the rain should start light in the North Bay
before spreading southward with increasing coverage and intensity.
There is still some uncertainty regarding the exact impacts of this
system, and in particular, ensemble model cluster analysis is
beginning to note a significant strand of model guidance that keeps
rain chances around through Saturday the 15th. However, most model
and Atmospheric River guidance continues to lean towards the
beneficial side of the impacts to our region.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 327 AM PST Fri Nov 7 2025

Light rain associated with a weak frontal boundary will result in
periods of light rain continuing early this morning at KSTS, along
with periods of limited visibility from patchy dense fog that lift
by mid/late morning. South of the North Bay, we`re seeing mostly
VFR conditions that are expected to persist through the remainder
of the TAF period.

Vicinity of SFO...VFR conditions are expected to persist through
the forecast period. There is a slight chance of some MVFR
ceilings around sunrise with some low stratus and patchy fog
lingering in vicinity of the terminals.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...VFR is expected to prevail through the
forecast period with a slight chance of some MVFR ceilings around
sunrise, but confidence is too low for mentioning in the TAFs.

.MARINE...
(Today through Wednesday)
Issued at 327 AM PST Fri Nov 7 2025

Rough seas continue across the coastal waters with moderate
period WNW swell persisting. Seas will gradually ease to moderate
by Saturday with more favorable conditions expected to continue
into the beginning of next week.

.BEACHES...
Issued at 1118 AM PST Thu Nov 6 2025

Hazardous beach conditions will persist through Saturday for all
coastal beaches. Expect an increased risk of sneaker waves and
rip currents as well as breaking waves up to 25 feet. Remain out
of the water to avoid hazardous swimming conditions, stay off of
jetties, piers, and other waterside infrastructure, and never turn
your back on the ocean! The increased risk for sneaker waves and
rip currents will linger Friday through early Saturday morning
with westerly swell quickly rebuilding.
