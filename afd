.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 205 AM PDT Thu Oct 26 2023

A colder airmass will arrive behind a cold front today bringing
colder overnight lows through Saturday morning. Patchy frost is
possible in the North Bay Valleys. Elevated fire weather concerns
may develop late Saturday into Sunday with increasing offshore
winds.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 205 AM PDT Thu Oct 26 2023

A relatively dry cold front is currently approaching the Bay Area.
The passage of this cold front will bring chances for light drizzle,
but it will only produce very light accumulations if any. As this
cold front moves through, it will clear out clouds and drop
temperatures from north to south.

Cold and dry air will emerge behind the cold front today and persist
through tonight. Colder overnight lows and limited cloud cover are
expected in the post-frontal environment, allowing for more
efficient radiational cooling. Temperatures will be coldest in the
North Bay interior valleys, along the Diablo Range, along the Santa
Lucia Range, and in the Salinas Valley with minimum temperatures in
the mid to upper 30s. While we are not expecting widespread frost
tonight into tomorrow morning due to minimum temperatures forecast
to be slightly above the threshold as well as dry, northerly winds
commencing behind the cold front, it is not out of the question that
isolated locations may see some patchy frost. Elsewhere near the
coast, minimum temperatures will stay relatively seasonable in the
mid 40s to low 50s range. For the interior valleys of the Bay Area
and Central coast, expect lows in the low 40s tonight.

Breezy north-northwest winds are expected today in the post-frontal
environment with limited low cloud coverage in the morning and then
ultimately clear skies in the afternoon and evening.&&

.LONG TERM...
(Friday through Wednesday)
Issued at 205 AM PDT Thu Oct 26 2023

Friday through Sunday:

A cyclonic flow pattern will prevail aloft as a positively tilted
longwave trough progresses southeast through the interior west. The
forecast period should begin with a cold front pushing south through
our area on Friday. Any precipitation is looking less and less
likely, but it will set the stage for a chilly and potentially
frosty Friday night. The pattern remains quite active into the
weekend, with a backdoor cold front sweeping through the region on
Saturday with strong surface ridging building across the northern
Rockies and Great Basin. As the pressure gradient tightens across
the Sierra this will set the stage for an offshore wind event on
Saturday night into Sunday with potential fire weather concerns.
Since we have a couple potential hazards to deal with let`s dig into
the details a little:

Colder Temperatures and Frost Potential: our primary area of concern
appears to be the North Bay valleys on Friday night into Saturday
morning. Conditions look favorable with post-frontal conditions
giving clearing skies, decoupled and light surface layer winds, and
some humidity recovery before winds turn more offshore on Saturday.
The primary question is how low temperatures go. Looking at 50th
percentile values (representing a `most likely` forecast scenario)
from the National Blend of Models (NBM) and a consensus of all
available models suggests low temperatures in the 39-44 degree range
in this area. Definitely cool, but not quite as cool as we`d prefer
to see for widespread frost. However if we look at 10th percentile
values from the each source both place readings in the 33-36 degree
range which is definitely there. Did note that the NBM is skewing
towards the colder end of things as compared to a consensus of
models, so decided to lean in this direction by taking a blend of
50th/10th percentile values for lows, which places us right on the
cusp of developing patchy to areas of frost in these areas. We`ll
definitely watch trends going forward but it`s possible Frost
Advisories may be necessary for the North Bay valleys Friday night
if we do end up on the lower side of the available model temperature
guidance.

Offshore Winds and Fire Weather Concerns: a backdoor cold front will
sweep through the area on Saturday with strong high pressure located
over the northern Rockies. A robust pressure gradient will exist in
its wake with increasing northeasterly (offshore) low-level winds
developing by Saturday afternoon. 1000-850 mb layer averaged winds
peak at 30-35 kt Saturday night suggesting ridgetop speeds could
exceed 40 mph. Some downward momentum transport could bring
gustiness into the area valleys during this time as well. The
stronger winds will push southwest through the core of the Bay Area
during the overnight hours on Saturday into Sunday morning. These
winds will transport very dry air into the region, with poor
Saturday morning humidity recoveries and afternoon values in the 10-
25 percent range. The trend over the last several NBM runs has
favored greater drying, leading to increasing concern for enhanced
fire weather conditions. One potential positive is the wetting
rainfall we received over the weekend, so this may serve as a
mitigating factor. That said, the pattern setup outlined above does
raise some concerns. Stay tuned for updates as we fine tune this
important part of the forecast. Remember to do your part to be "one
less spark". Remember: one less spark, one less wildfire.

Monday through Wednesday:

A shortwave ridge aloft should set up over the region bringing dry
conditions and slightly warmer temperatures. However the pattern
appears a bit more unsettled towards late week as upstream troughing

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 416 AM PDT Thu Oct 26 2023

Currently seeing VFR conditions at all TAF sites with the exception
of MRY and SNS. Winds are calm in the more sheltered areas and
generally northwesterly and breezy elsewhere. MRY and SNS should be
clearing once the cold front passes over the terminals and winds
take on a northerly component, which should be in the next couple of
hours at the latest. Skies will generally remain clear and winds
will stay generally onshore and breezy through the TAF period.

Vicinity of SFO...Currently VFR with breezy onshore flow. Winds will
generally remain westerly and breezy through the TAF period.
Westerly wind will peak at about 17 knots this afternoon.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...Currently seeing light onshore flow at both
terminals with an IFR ceiling at MRY and an MVFR ceiling at SNS. The
ceilings should be clearing out within the next two hours or so as
more northerly winds kick in behind the cold front. Winds will
become breezy and onshore this afternoon with Monterey peaking at
about 10 knots and Salinas peaking at about 13 knots.

.MARINE...
(Today through Tuesday)

northwest winds will continue, remaining strongest mainly across
the southern coastal waters overnight into early Friday. North to
northwest winds increasing again elsewhere across the coastal
waters late in the week. Gusty winds will diminish on Sunday.

.MTR WATCHES/WARNINGS/ADVISORIES...
CA...None.
PZ...Small Craft Advisory from 3 PM this afternoon to 9 PM PDT this
