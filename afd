...New UPDATE, MARINE...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 130 AM PDT Sat Sep 7 2024

A slight cool down will begin today as a weak upper level trough
impacts the region, yet temperatures remain above seasonal norms
through early in the upcoming week. By midweek, a more robust
cooling trend will kick off as a stronger upper level through drives
southward out of the Gulf of Alaska.

&&

.UPDATE...
Issued at 920 AM PDT Sat Sep 7 2024

The fog continues to recede with some lingering pockets in along
the coast and in the North Bay Valleys. As such, the Fog Advisory
has been allowed to expire.

The focus of the afternoon forecast package will be mostly
concerning the shift to more onshore flow this week, leading to
a deepening marine layer and a cooling trend.



&&

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 130 AM PDT Sat Sep 7 2024

Today will begin the start of a cooling trend, especially across the
North Bay and greater San Francisco Bay Area while far interior
portions of the Central Coast remain hot with a few places likely to
exceed 100 degrees. Expecting maximum temperatures across the
interior to warm into the 80`s to mid 90`s, 70`s and 80`s near the
Bay Shoreline, and 60`s and 70`s near the coast (exception being
the Santa Cruz area with mid 80`s).

Tonight, look for better humidity recoveries in all but the highest
elevations. Look for low clouds to spread back inland and into the
adjacent coastal valleys as the marine layer deepens slightly. Thus,
temperatures will drop into the low to upper 50`s across much of the
region, near 60 degrees across the Santa Clara Valley, and 60`s to
upper 70`s in the higher peaks of the Central Coast.

&&

.LONG TERM...
(Sunday through Friday)
Issued at 130 AM PDT Sat Sep 7 2024

The heat across the interior Central Coast will subside on Sunday
and Monday, but otherwise similar temperatures elsewhere as
Saturday. A more pronounced cooling trend will occur on Tuesday and
Wednesday as an upper level trough drops southward out of the Gulf
of Alaska. This will bring temperatures near or below seasonal
averages for midweek. At this time, chances of precipitation look to
remain well to the north of the region.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 458 AM PDT Sat Sep 7 2024

Mix of VFR and LIFR across the board. Patchy fog continues at STS
and across the Central Coast with clearing expected by mid to late
morning. Moderate confidence in timing of fog/stratus clearing with
ensemble guidance indicating the most likely timeframe is between 16-
18Z. For APC and SJC, confidence is low to moderate that stratus
won`t reach the airport but some scattered low clouds may be
possible. For OAK, confidence is moderate that stratus will reach
the airport between 13-14Z. After stratus clears, VFR conditions
return through the evening with widespread stratus expected to
return between 05-09Z tomorrow. The marine layer looks to deepen
tonight which increases confidence in a more widespread and earlier
return of stratus tonight. Northwest winds generally between 8 to 15
knots are expected to prevail through the TAF period with locally
gustier conditions possible for OAK and SFO.

Vicinity of SFO...Patchy LIFR CIGs continue to impact SFO with
stratus expected to reach OAK in the next 1 to 2 hours. Moderate
confidence that LIFR CIGs will continue through the late morning
before VFR conditions return. IFR CIGs are expected to return late
tomorrow evening between 05-08Z and persist through the remainder of
the TAF period. Moderate northwest winds continue with gusts up to
25 knots possible during the afternoon/evening.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...LIFR conditions to continue at MRY and SNS
through late this morning before VFR conditions return through the
afternoon and into the evening. IFR-LIFR CIGs return by the late
evening with CIGs and visibilities expected to gradually decrease
moving into the overnight hours. Moderate northwest winds return
late this morning and continue into the evening before weakening and
becoming more variable overnight.

&&

.MARINE...
(Today through Thursday)
Issued at 920 AM PDT Sat Sep 7 2024

Pockets of fog will lift into the afternoon. Expect moderate to
breezy north to northwest winds continue through the weekend with
occasional gusty winds over the southern waters. Northwest winds
strengthen and wave heights increase over the California coastal
waters ahead of an incoming low pressure system by the middle of
next week with unsettled conditions persisting through the end of
the week.
