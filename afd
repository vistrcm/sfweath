...New UPDATE, MARINE...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 1201 AM PDT Tue Jul 23 2024

Inland heat continues through mid-week. Excessive Heat Warnings
and Heat Advisories are in effect through Wednesday evening for
areas away from the coast. A cold front will bring significant
relief by Friday.

.UPDATE...
Issued at 959 AM PDT Tue Jul 23 2024

No changes to the forecast at this time. Today will be the warmest
day of the week, and only slightly cooler tomorrow. By Thursday,
the ridge of high pressure over southwest CONUS begins to be
suppressed by a strong upper level low over the SE Pacific that
will be responsible for cooling our area down considerably, with
highs 5-10 degrees below normal by the weekend.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 1201 AM PDT Tue Jul 23 2024

The marine layer is holding steady at 1,000 ft which may bring
some patchy areas of coastal fog later this morning, especially
along the Monterey Bay. Otherwise the morning will be pretty
similar to yesterday with coastal stratus early, and warm inland
temperatures in the afternoon. As high pressure sets up camp over
California, the 23/00Z sounding found an 850 mb temp has climbed
to 24.75C, which should increase over the next 36 hours. The
ECMWF ensemble shows pretty high confidence that this benchmark
will reach 27C by 24/12Z. The forecast temperatures this afternoon
are holding steady with somewhere around 100 degrees expected in
portions of the inland East Bay and Monterey/San Benito counties.
The inland North and South Bay will be in the mid to upper 90s.
Coastal areas will remain in the typical summertime 60s and 70s.
For areas within the heat warnings, remember the following tips:

* Stay hydrated and drink plenty of fluids.
* Wear lightweight, light-colored clothing.
* Reduce time spent outdoors or stay in the shade.
* Never leave people or pets unattended in vehicles.
* Use sunscreen if going to the coast or the pool.

The one wildcard is a small potential for thunderstorms beginning
today and persisting through Wednesday. A disturbance offshore
the Baja Peninsula is deep enough to divert the subtropical jet.
The interaction between this feature and the high pressure over
California will generate SW flow through the majority of the
troposphere. This will pump mid-level moisture and trigger some
instability. The 06Z HRRR has a decent MUCAPE of around 327 J/kg
with a 99.5th percentile PWAT of 1.42" This afternoon/evening.
The 2 inhibitors are that this instability and moisture is all
elevated (LCL over 15,000 ft), and there is around 200 J/kg of CIN
to overcome below the instability. The newest HRRR runs are
coming in with much less CAPE than earlier NAM runs. All together,
there is currently less than a 10% chance for thunderstorms to
develop, so it won`t be mentioned explicitly in our forecasts.
There should at least be some interesting mid-level clouds that
could make for a nice sunset this evening.

.LONG TERM...
(Wednesday through Monday)
Issued at 1201 AM PDT Tue Jul 23 2024

No major change to the long term forecast tonight. High pressure
will reamin over California through Thursday. By Friday, the
subtropical low in the E. Pacific will move north and be picked up
by the jet stream before moving inland on Friday. This will be
followed by a cold front that will flip the mid and upper-level
winds from SW to NW, and usher in a cooler air mass. While these
subtropical disturbances can be hard to forecast, this is not a
small disturbance that takes a little bite out of the high and
brings a day or two of cooler weather. This is a significant
regime change. This is what we`ve been waiting for since the 4th
of July.

For inland areas dealing with the heat, today will be the hottest
day of the week, but the cooling will begin to accelerate soon.
Expect the max temp to drop a few degrees Wednesday, another 5 or
so Thursday, and a further 10 degrees on Friday. The weekend
temps look great, but the price for that cooling is morning
clouds and afternoon wind. San Francisco and Salinas will be in
the 60s, Santa Rosa, Napa and San Jose in the upper 70s, and
Concord and Livermore will be in the mid 80s. It was a long, hot
July. Enjoy the cooler weather this weekend.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 359 AM PDT Tue Jul 23 2024

Stratus and fog /LIFR-IFR/ prevail along the immediate coastline
northward to coastal Sonoma County per satellite imagery. Otherwise
it`s VFR across the forecast area. The marine layer varies in
depth from 1,000 feet at Fort Ord to a few hundred feet deep at
Bodega Bay per recent profiler data. A 4.1 mb ACV-SFO pressure
gradient (northerly wind) predominates and is juxtaposed to a 1.3
mb SMX-SFO pressure gradient and 1.6 mb SNS-SJC gradient (southerly
wind), while the onshore gradient is 1.7 mb SFO-SAC.

A wild card in the coastal stratus and fog coverage is the incoming
higher precipitable water (higher water vapor) arriving from
southern California and how it may or may not affect coastal
stratus and fog coverage later today and tonight. Inland terminals
are high probability VFR, however it`s low confidence if coastal
terminals will have patchy LIFR-IFR conditions nearby later today,
tonight and Wednesday morning.

Vicinity of SFO...VFR. West wind near 10 knots, increasing to 15
knots this afternoon and early evening, then decreasing to less
than 10 knots late this evening and overnight.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...LIFR-IFR in coastal stratus and fog
this morning. Conditions improving to MVFR-VFR during the day,
mainly later in the morning. Patchy coastal stratus and fog
/LIFR-IFR/ may be nearby tonight and Wednesday morning.

&&

.MARINE...
(Today through Sunday)
Issued at 959 AM PDT Tue Jul 23 2024

Northwesterly winds and seas will continue to ease across the
northern outer coastal waters today. Significant wave heights will
abate through the forecast period. A compressed marine layer will
result in patches of dense fog along the coast this morning,
tonight and Wednesday morning.
