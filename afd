...New UPDATE, MARINE...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 216 AM PST Tue Jan 28 2025

Upper level ridging, in the omega block fashion, is forecast through
mid to late week. High pressure will dominate our region leading to
chilly mornings and mild days through Thursday.  Coastal fog and
stratus will attempt to return mid week and may penetrate into some
valleys. A pattern change is looking likely, which may bring rain to
the service area this weekend.

.UPDATE...
Issued at 840 AM PST Tue Jan 28 2025

Chilly to downright cold temperature across the region this morning,
but conditions will warm into the upper 50s to lower 60s across
major urban areas. Therefore, the Frost/Freeze products are allowed
to expire at 9 AM this morning. Look for another around of
Frost/Freeze product issued by this afternoon. However, low clouds
are expected to make a return to coastal locations across the region
which will limit the extend of the products. Otherwise, the forecast
remains on track with no updates anticipated this morning.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 216 AM PST Tue Jan 28 2025

High pressure dominates the short term forecast, leaving us with
mainly clear skies today. Morning low temperatures  will drop into
the mid/upper 20s in wind sheltered locations while widespread 30s
are expected elsewhere. The Freeze Warning remains in effect until 9
AM this morning for sub-freezing across the Salinas Valley, higher
terrain of the Monterey/San Bentio Mountains, and eastern Santa
Clara Hills. Meanwhile, the Frost Advisory is in place for the rest
of the Central Coast, Bay Shoreline, East Bay Valleys/Mountains,
Santa Clara Valley, and most of the North Bay excluding areas near
the immediate coast. Given the chilly start to today, temperatures
rebound into the upper 50s and low 60s under mainly sunny skies.

Tonight, stratus should creep in from the Pacific and infiltrate our
coasts. There is some uncertainty as to how far inland it will make
it but the North Bay could see low clouds and fog as early as late
this evening, while stratus snakes its way into other areas
overnight. This will make Tuesday night/Wednesday morning`s low

.LONG TERM...
(Wednesday through Monday)
Issued at 216 AM PST Tue Jan 28 2025

Omega blocking should last through Thursday with upper level
troughing occuring flattening the ridge by Friday. This will be the
beginning of the pattern change and where rain chances return to the
service area. The latest trends have more zonal flow over the Bay
Area and Central Coast region, while upper level troughing is
observed over the PacNW. This means the moisture tap, which includes
PWATs ranging from 0.5-1.0" over our region, and the best chances
for beneficial rain at this time seem to favor NW CA towards the
North Bay counties.  Chances for measurable rain decrease as you
move south from the North Bay.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 326 AM PST Tue Jan 28 2025

Patchy MVFR-IFR stratus has developed across the Bay Area,
chiefly in the North Bay south of STS, the East Bayshore including
OAK, and on the coast of the San Mateo Peninsula. Otherwise, high
confidence of light winds through the TAF period and VFR into the
afternoon hours. Stratus returns to the terminals late this
evening, with some uncertainty in ceiling heights as models
disagree on whether MVFR ceilings prevail or if IFR-LIFR ceilings
develop. For now, have kept ceilings above LIFR thresholds, except
at STS. Will monitor upcoming model output in case confidence in
either solution increases. Stratus dissipates Wednesday morning
after the end of the TAF period.

Vicinity of SFO... Scattered stratus in the terminal area could
impact the terminal through the morning. Light west-northwest breeze
this afternoon and evening with MVFR stratus expanding over the
terminal late this evening.

SFO Bridge Approach... Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals... VFR through the evening hours, when
stratus develops over the terminals through Wednesday morning. Have
kept MVFR ceilings over both terminals but some models have LIFR
ceilings developing at MRY. Light winds throughout the TAF period
with northwest flow this afternoon.

&&

.MARINE...
(Today through Sunday)
Issued at 840 AM PST Tue Jan 28 2025

Expect light to moderate winds and light seas through Friday.
Unsettled weather returns Friday into next week as an upper level
low brings gusty conditions to the northern waters and widespread
rain over the waters.

.MTR WATCHES/WARNINGS/ADVISORIES...
CA...Freeze Watch from late tonight through Thursday morning for
     CAZ504-506-508-510-512>518-528>530.
