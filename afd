.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 251 AM PDT Tue May 23 2023

A cooling trend will begin on Tuesday and persist through the
remainder of the week in response to an upper level trough over
the West Coast. As such, temperatures will largely be slightly
below seasonal averages through late week.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 251 AM PDT Tue May 23 2023

A band of mid/high level clouds dropping southward into the North
Bay early this morning are associated with a long-wave trough
aloft. To the south, marine stratus has developed over much of the
Central Coast and into the region`s interior valleys. This
pattern also supports patch drizzle which has already been
reported at places such as Watsonville and Salinas this morning.
The aforementioned trough will sweep through the entire region by
this afternoon and will allow for decent mixing of the boundary
layer. As such, expecting most areas to see some clearing by early
afternoon. In response to the cooling air mass aloft,
temperatures across the interior will be slightly cooler today
compared to previous days. Overall, look for temperatures to be in
the upper 50s to lower 60s near the coast with upper 60s to 70s
inland. While this troughing pattern supports the potential for
convection across the northern and interior portions of the state,
the probability of any development over the Bay Area/Central
Coast remains low (
