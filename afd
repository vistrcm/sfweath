...New AVIATION...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 310 AM PDT Wed Oct 11 2023

Windy today, with warmer and drier conditions through Friday as
ridging develops. Towards Friday afternoon, new chances of
precipitation appear as a weak front pushes in bringing rainfall
primarily for the North Bay. Into the last part of the weekend and
into early next week, hints at warmer temperatures once again.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 310 AM PDT Wed Oct 11 2023

At this early morning hour, only a few echoes are being picked up by
radar over the Santa Clara valley as just a few lingering showers
exit the region. Otherwise, nighttime satellite imagery shows mostly
clear skies. Winds are currently around 5-10 mph generally around
the region, though into the afternoon today, winds increase out of
the N/NW, gusting to around 20-25 mph before weakening into the
evening. A bit breezy overall, but not much to write home about
otherwise. With recent rains, not much in the way of fire weather
concerns.

Moving into Thursday and Friday, high pressure begins to build into
the region leading to a bit of a warm up, though less so than what
was witnessed last week. Temperatures will generally range from the
upper 70s to low 80s inland, and closer to the upper 60s and low 70s
along the coastline. Meanwhile, minimum temperatures in the upper
40s to low 50s are forecast.

.LONG TERM...
(Thursday through Tuesday)
Issued at 310 AM PDT Wed Oct 11 2023

Looking just a tad bit further out, precipitation chances generally
return late Friday as a weak front pushes through. The best chances
of rainfall are confined to Marin county and north, with not much in
the way of measurable rainfall expected south of the SF peninsula
but for a hundredth of an inch or two. This will overall result in
rainfall being confined to the North Bay zones, with the
northernmost portions of Sonoma county receiving as much as 0.20",
to Napa and Marin counties receiving anywhere from a few hundredths
of an inch, to 0.10". As we get closer to the event, these amounts
may change, but nonetheless, still expecting some beneficial early
season rainfall Friday into Saturday, with the CPC 6-10 day outlook
continuing to show above normal precip chances.

Towards the latter half of the weekend and into early next week,
models suggest more ridging developing, leading to warmer and drier
conditions once again. This is consistent with CPC 6-10 and 8-14 day
guidance showing above normal temperatures. Though at this time,
placement of the ridge axis is uncertain. Stay tuned for updates.
