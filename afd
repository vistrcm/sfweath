.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 143 AM PDT Sun Oct 1 2023

Mostly cloudy skies this morning turning partly cloudy this
afternoon with continued seasonably cool temperatures as low
pressure exits to our east. High pressure builds Monday through
much of next week. Temperatures near normal Monday warm to well
above normal Wednesday through Friday with periods of light
offshore winds that will gradually increase fire weather concerns
for the second half of the week. The ridge stays in place through
next weekend before breaking down around Columbus Day.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 143 AM PDT Sun Oct 1 2023

Low pressure that brought some rain showers to the region on
Saturday will continue to wobble eastward over Nevada. Cyclonic
circulation is on the wane with just a few lingering showers
across the region that will dissipate through sunrise. We have a
mix of cloud decks in the wake of the upper low with some
2000-3000 foot cloud decks around the Central Coast and some
lingering mid cloud decks across the Bay Area. It will take awhile
but as drier northerly flow develops today expect more sunshine
this afternoon with highs back into the upper 60s to mid 70s.

With more clearing tonight and the result of the recent rain could
some some pockets of valley fog develop tonight into Monday
morning for places like the 101 corridor in Sonoma Valley that are
protected from developing northerly winds across the Napa hills.

&&

.LONG TERM...
(Monday through Saturday)
Issued at 143 AM PDT Sun Oct 1 2023

Temperatures near normal Monday as high pressure begins to build
and dry northerly flow continues over the region, especially the
North Bay with about 4-8 degrees of warming compared to Sunday
afternoon highs.

On Tuesday afternoon a shortwave will move across Oregon and as it
kicks eastward the ridge will strengthen and a more favorable surface
pressure gradient will start to setup across Northern California
for inducing northerly flow down the Sacramento Valley eventually
passing over the Napa hills Tuesday night into Weds morning. This
will do a few things: drying airmass will lower humidities and
downslope flow will allow temps to warm back into the upper 70s
and 80s regionwide. The setup looks pretty textbook for a light to
moderate fall offshore wind event. During these scenarios favored
adiabatic downslope warming usually allows temps to trend on the
warmer side of model guidance. In addition, and this is picked up
by the EFI, temps near the coast and bays are similar and or warmer
than then the inland temps. Starting Tuesday night northeast winds
in the 10-20 mph range for the North Bay hills will keep the
airmass well mixed at night with mild temps in the hills that will
quickly warm as the sun comes out on Weds allowing temps to soar
well into the upper 80s and 90s across the region. Its possible
some record highs could be tied or broken Weds through Friday but
either way it will get hot during the afternoon. Will post the
record high data below in the .CLIMATE section. The first week of
October historically features some of our warmer temps as seasonal
dry offshore wind events historically occur. Looks like many of
the records this week occurred in 1930, 1980 and 1987 for proxy
patterns. Fire weather concerns will gradually increase with
hotter temps, periods of dry offshore winds (especially during the
overnight hours during the 2nd half of the week), lowering
humidity and a drying of the fine fuels all lining up with
climatology of peak fire season. Will note that fuels are only
forecast to be near normal dryness values but now the live fuel
components are approaching their minimums for the year. The
Extreme Forecast Index (EFI) is a good tool for sniffing out rare
event days and its not too excited about the upcoming week when
warm and dry weather is the norm and its not picking up on any
wind anomalies with the main focus on coastal warming which is no
surprise given the forecast synoptic pattern.

The heat should peak Weds through Friday then wane but still stay
warm and dry next weekend. Some hint of a trough passage as we
approach Columbus Day monday.  Heat products shouldn`t be needed
with cooling at night and a relatively dry airmass.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 421 AM PDT Sun Oct 1 2023

MVFR ceilings across the Central Coast for the rest of the night,
with clearing expected around 17-19Z. Elsewhere, mid-to-high level
clouds persist with patchy MVFR stratus across the region. Calm
winds will build into breezy onshore winds up to 10-15 knots.
General VFR expected from this afternoon throughout the TAF period,
with low confidence of ceilings at the immediate coast and down the
Salinas Valley this evening.

Vicinity of SFO... VFR through the TAF period, with mid-level clouds
through the morning. Breezy west-northwest winds will build this
afternoon, gusting up to 20-25 knots. Winds become light in the
evening.

SFO Bridge Approach... Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals... MVFR ceilings clear out between 17-19Z at
the terminals, with west-northwest winds setting up in the
afternoon up to 10-12 knots. Low confidence (20-30% probability)
of MVFR stratus developing this evening, so while the TAFs do have
VFR through the end of the TAF period, have issued SCT groups for
potential ceilings.

.MARINE...
(Today through Friday)
Issued at 421 AM PDT Sun Oct 1 2023

Northerly gale-force gusts north of Point Reyes diminishing
through the day. High pressure becomes the dominant feature where
winds will decrease and seas abate creating more favorable
conditions expected through the week.
