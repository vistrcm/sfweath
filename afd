.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 136 AM PST Wed Dec 25 2024

Chilly temperatures, clear skies, and recent rainfall create a risk
for fog and low stratus development through Christmas morning.
Another series of storms enters the North Bay tonight and continues
into the weekend.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 136 AM PST Wed Dec 25 2024

As Santa came through the Bay Area and Central Coast delivering
presents to all the good little boys and girls below, he found the
skies clear and the air chilly. With lows tonight ranging from the
low to mid 30s in the inland valleys to the middle to upper 40s
along the coast and Bayshore, it`s shaping up to be a chilly
Christmas morning across the region. Frost Advisories are in effect
across the North Bay inland valleys and the interior Central Coast,
including the southern Salinas Valley, until 9 AM today. Keep an eye
out for vulnerable populations such as children, the elderly, or
those with certain medical conditions, especially if they don`t have
adequate heating or shelter. Every so often, with the recent
rainfall promoting moist conditions near the ground, Santa would
even encounter a patch of fog and low stratus when traveling around
the inland regions -- thank goodness for Rudolph`s bright red nose!
If you happen to come across these patches of dense fog in your
sleigh, remember to slow down, leave more space between you and the
vehicle in front of you, and use low beam headlights.

Christmas Day should remain dry across the region with highs inching
up to the middle to upper 50s across the lower elevations and into
the upper 40s to lower 50s in the mountains. The skies should start
out partially cloudy before filling in through the day as the first
of another series of storm systems sets in later tonight. Hazardous
surf continues at the Pacific coast, for more information, see the
BEACHES section.

.LONG TERM...
(Thursday through Tuesday)
Issued at 136 AM PST Wed Dec 25 2024

The days after Christmas will be dominated by a series of shortwave
troughs that will bring multiple rounds of rain to the region into
the weekend. Most of the rain will be concentrated across the North
Bay, where continued rainfall increases minor flooding and small
landslide concerns, particularly as soils continue to saturate
across the region. The forecast for rainfall totals through the
series is still being refined, particularly for the later storms
late Friday into the weekend, but based on the current forecast, the
North Bay could receive around 1-3 inches of rain in the valleys with
up to 5 inches in the higher elevations. For the rest of the
forecast area, it looks like the best chances for impactful rain
come Thursday night into Friday, with the coastal ranges and the San
Francisco-Oakland-Richmond region seeing more consistent rainfall,
although totals won`t be as impactful as those north of the Golden
Gate. Cumulative rainfall totals through the weekend range from 1-2
inches in the Santa Cruz Mountains, 0.5-1.5 inches for the Bay Area,
and 0.25-0.75 inches in the Monterey Bay region.

Upper level ridging should set in for the early part of next week,
potentially heralding a lull in the rainfall. Ensemble model cluster
analysis reveals a signal for potential rainfall around or just
after the new year, with clusters drawing on the American ensemble
model in particular showing the potential for another round of
significant rainfall while the clusters that draw from the Canadian
and European ensemble models lean towards drier solutions. CPC
guidance depicts an ever-so-slight lean towards temperatures above
seasonal averages and rainfall totals below seasonal averages for
the first week of the New Year.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 317 AM PST Wed Dec 25 2024

There have been brief reductions in ceilings and visibilities
overnight, but confidence is increasing in the terminals remaining
VFR through the morning as the cloud shield from the approaching
system slides into the region, limiting further radiational cooling.
Ceilings will lower and winds will become southerly ahead of the
cold front with rain spreading from northwest to southeast tonight.

Vicinity of SFO...Currently VFR with northwesterly flow. Winds will
begin backing this evening, strengthening and becoming southerly
ahead of the cold front. Ceilings will lower through the day as the
cold front approaches, becoming MVFR when the rain begins around 13Z
Thursday.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...Currently VFR with easterly flow at MRY and
VFR with westerly flow at SNS. VFR through the TAF period. Ceilings
will lower and winds will become southeasterly ahead of the cold
front.

.MARINE...
(Today through Monday)
Issued at 317 AM PST Wed Dec 25 2024

Rough seas will continue to improve as large westerly swell
abates over the next 24 hours. Very rough seas will rebuild
Thursday and persist through the weekend as a series of
disturbances brings unsettled weather to the coastal waters.

&&

.BEACHES...
Issued at 317 AM PST Wed Dec 25 2024

Conditions have improved enough to cancel the High Surf Advisory
early this morning. After a short reprieve Wednesday, fresh NW
swell arrives on Thursday and will persist through the weekend.
The current guidance suggest this swell will arrive with moderate-
high energy and roughly 15 ft height and 15 second period. This
would translate to breaking waves of 20-30 feet. A new High Surf
Advisory is in effect from 10 AM Thursday through 4 PM Sunday.
While these waves are smaller than the monsters we got on Monday,
the coast is still dangerous. Inexperienced swimmers should stay
out of the water, wave watchers should maintain a a safe distance,
and no one should ever turn their back on the ocean. Let`s get
through this weekend without another ocean fatality.
