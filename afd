.UPDATE...
Issued at 842 AM PDT Tue Aug 26 2025

Current radar imagery from KMUX is picking up on high based rain
showers, likely precipitating in the form of virga, across the North
Bay and parts of the East Bay. Meanwhile the mid levels between the
marine layer and this mid/upper level moisture remains dry. Will be
adding showers with a non-zero chance of high based thunderstorms
for this region through the afternoon and early evening hours. There
is enough MUCAPE and insatiability across this region to warrant a
mention in the forecast. Updated forecast will be out shortly.

.SHORT TERM...
Issued at 228 AM PDT Tue Aug 26 2025
(Today and tonight)

A healthy marine layer around 2000ft has filled in across our
coastal areas and inland valleys during the overnight. Expect the
associated stratus to retreat to the coastline by late morning/early
afternoon for most locations, with seasonal temperatures under
mostly sunny skies area wide. The mid-level moisture and associated
conditional instability remains over the region today, but similar
to Monday, not expecting any elevated convection to develop this
afternoon or evening. The lack of a lifting mechanism continues to
be the primary limiting factor.

.LONG TERM...
Issued at 228 AM PDT Tue Aug 26 2025
(Wednesday through Monday)

Weak troughing will persist through midweek before a subtle shift
toward shortwave ridging for end of the week, providing slightly
warmer temperatures for the weekend. The weak ridging pattern over
the weekend will give way to more persistent troughing over the
eastern Pacific for the remainder of the extended forecast,
resulting in cooler temperatures for the beginning of next week and
beyond.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 439 AM PDT Tue Aug 26 2025

Stratus /MVFR-LIFR/ is moving inland on onshore winds. The SFO-SAC
pressure gradient is 2.9 mb, while the ACV-SFO 0.4 mb and SMX-SFO
1.2 mb gradients are juxtaposed along the coast with a weak surface
trough over the coastal waters. Recent NAM output forecasts a few
degrees Celsius cooling in the vicinity 925 mb today and tonight,
some deepening of the marine layer is likely during this time. Thin,
highly elevated (i.e. above the 500 mb level) monsoon moisture has
been having minimal influences on the marine layer so far. Stratus
/MVFR-LIFR/ will mix out back to the coastline today, then move back
inland tonight and Wednesday morning. Farthest inland VFR will
prevail.

Vicinity of SFO...Stratus surrounds the terminal, forecast for the
morning includes tempo BKN010 13z-17z otherwise VFR is forecast
today and this evening, then stratus /MVFR/ returns 10z Wednesday.
Light and variable wind possible during the morning otherwise west
wind 5 to 10 knots.

SFO Bridge Approach...Stratus /MVFR/ mixing out by late morning,
otherwise VFR today and this evening. Stratus returns early ~ 10z
Wednesday morning.

Monterey Bay Terminals...Stratus /IFR-LIFR/ this morning, mixing
out by late morning. Stratus /MVFR-IFR/ returns tonight and
Wednesday morning. Mainly onshore winds 5 to 15 knots.

.MARINE...
(Today through Sunday)
Issued at 228 AM PDT Tue Aug 26 2025

Gentle to moderate breezes and moderate seas persist across the
majority of the coastal waters through the week. Locally moderate
to fresh gusts and rough seas are expected across the far northern
outer waters.
