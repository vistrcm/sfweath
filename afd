...New SYNOPSIS, FIRE WEATHER...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 449 AM PDT Fri Oct 25 2024

Weak offshore flow will help keep temperatures around 5-10 degrees
above normal inland today, with dry conditions maintaining
elevated fire weather concerns through sunset this evening. A
upper level trough moves onshore Sunday, dropping temperatures to
around or slightly below normal for the upcoming work week.

&&

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 303 AM PDT Fri Oct 25 2024

Elevated fire weather concerns will continue through early Friday
morning, particularly above 1000 feet, where poor (~5-25%) overnight
humidity recoveries and light offshore flow continue. A glance at
the fire snooper shows that the driest sites (humidity values
between 5 to 15%) are all located at elevations above 3000 feet and
are observing light (< 10 mph) offshore flow. The SFO-WMC pressure
gradient is still fairly strong and, as of 2AM, is clocking in at
-8.90 mb after peaking at -10.20 mb at 7 PM. HRRR pressure gradient
 guidance indicates the gradient will continue to weaken
 throughout Friday morning with the gradient expected to flip
 positive (i.e. onshore flow) by late this morning/early this
 afternoon. This shift back to onshore flow will help alleviate
 fire weather concerns but dry daytime conditions (humidity values
 between 15-30%) will continue across the interior through the
 remainder of Friday. Some relief can be expected by Friday night
 as the marine layer is forecast to deepen, expand inland, and
 increase overnight humidity recoveries from poor to fair across
 much of the interior. Friday`s high temperatures will range from
 the 70s to low 80s inland and closer to the 60s to low 70s along
 the coast. Overnight Friday into Saturday, temperatures will cool
 down into the upper 40s to mid 50s.

.LONG TERM...
(Saturday through Thursday)
Issued at 303 AM PDT Fri Oct 25 2024

The leading edge of the next system bringing rain chances, primarily
across the North Bay, arrives late Saturday night into early Sunday
morning. As the trough begins to move inland, it takes on a positive
tilt, which will cutoff any potential moisture fetch from Hurricane
Kristy this far north. The active longwave pattern produces another
trough that moves onshore farther north late next week, once again
with limited coverage of rain chances across the North Bay.

The return of steady onshore flow will bring the influence of the
marine layer farther inland for the end of the weekend and the
upcoming work week. Expect increasing coverage of morning stratus,
patchy fog and drizzle along the coast with cooler than normal
temperatures area wide through the remainder of the extended
forecast.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 435 AM PDT Fri Oct 25 2024

VFR is expected to prevail through the forecast period. Weak
offshore flow this morning will eventually return back to onshore
later today with a gradual return of low marine stratus and patchy
fog overnight into early Saturday morning.

Vicinity of SFO...High confidence VFR through the TAF period. Expect
breezy onshore winds later this afternoon with a return of low
marine stratus in area, but may not impact the terminal directly.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...High confidence VFR through the TAF period.
Mostly calm winds this morning will eventually become breezy with an
onshore component and some stratus expected to develop and spread
north from the Big Sur area later tonight into early Saturday
morning.

.MARINE...
(Today through Wednesday)
Issued at 303 AM PDT Fri Oct 25 2024

Moderate wave heights today will persist through much of the
weekend  before an upper trough moves onshore across the Pacific
Northwest on  Sunday. Wave heights will increase in response to
increasing N/NW  surface winds, with significant wave heights of
10-12 feet expected  in the outer waters by Monday.

&&

.FIRE WEATHER...
Issued at 449 AM PDT Fri Oct 25 2024

Offshore flow will continue to weaken through the remainder of
Friday morning before gradually transitioning to onshore flow by
this afternoon. Current overnight humidity recoveries remain poor
above 1,000 feet with most sites reporting humidities between 25 to
40% while locally drier conditions persist at higher elevations.
Guidance from the HRRR and NAM indicates that the KSFO-KWMC pressure
gradient will transition from negative (offshore) to positive
(onshore) by late this morning/early this afternoon. The KSFO-KWMC
pressure gradient has continued to weaken with a pressure difference
of -8.20 mb reported at 4AM compared to -8.90 mb at 2AM. While the
winds have begun to weaken, elevated fire weather concerns will
linger through Friday evening as drier conditions persist through
the remainder of the day. Fire weather concerns will then decrease
heading into the weekend as an approaching upper level system brings
moister air, improving both nighttime and daytime humidities, and
elevated potential for light wetting rains to the North Bay.
