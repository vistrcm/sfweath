 - High pressure builds in with dry weather on through early to mid
   next week.

 - Cold overnight lows through early next week.&&

.SHORT TERM...
Issued at 359 AM PST Sat Dec 27 2025
(Today and tonight)

Upper level ridging builds to our east, pushing the upper level
trough off to our west. THis will usher in drier weather to the
region with most lingering showers being cut off by morning. Cooler
weather is on tap with high temperatures chilling in the low to mid
50s for many valley and coastal communities, while mountainous
regions vary from the low 40s to the mid 50s. Tonight, temperatures
are expected to be cold as well. The question will be, do we get
some high clouds skirting across the Bay Area counties? Should that
happen temperatures might be a few degrees warmer than forecast.
Should it not happen, we could be a few degrees colder due to
radiational cooling. That would fall more inline with the some of
the MOS guidance. Farther to the south, mostly clear skies should
prevail with temperatures for the interior Central Coast falling
into the 30s, perhaps lower for some of the higher elevation areas.
A Cold Weather Advisory has been hoisted these areas.

.LONG TERM...
Issued at 359 AM PST Sat Dec 27 2025
(Sunday through Friday)

Ensemble guidance favors upper level ridging through Tuesday into
Wednesday, with some uncertainty setting up for the end of the week.
Models show that the upper trough gets  elongated, cut off, and then
shoved to the southwest over the Pacific. It then meanders there for
quite some time while ridging nestles over us. By mid week guidance
shows upper level troughing from the Gulf of Alaska trying to dig
southwards pushing ridging to the east. It is here, where the models
begin to show variance between upper level troughing and quasi
zonal flow for the latter half of the work week. The NBM paints POP
over us starting as early as early as late Wednesday into Thursday,
with rain chances lingering through Friday. Rain at this point looks
to be beneficial. It will be worth watching to see if the Gulf
trough is able to breakdown the ridge and allow for the wetter
weather pattern or if the ridge is a bit more resilient. Stay tuned
to the forecast.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 341 AM PST Sat Dec 27 2025

Some very light, brief showers remain over the region this
morning, but will be exiting the area by sunrise. Patchy MVFR
stratus this morning associated with linger clouds from this
week`s storm system and localized FG around KSTS will all clear to
VFR by around sunrise today, then VFR persists through the rest of
the TAF period. High confidence in mostly clear skies going into
tonight and Sunday morning.

Vicinity of SFO...Largely unproblematic forecast with skies
clearing to VFR this morning and lasting through the TAF period (high
confidence). One hitch may be a slight shift in the winds with a
weak easterly component overnight tonight in the pre-dawn hours
Sunday morning. So slight chance of NE/SE winds during this
period, but speeds expected to remain below 6-7 kts.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...Lingering showers this morning (light
and brief), then clearing out to VFR by around sunrise. VFR
through the rest of the period with generally light onshore winds
during the afternoons (high confidence).

&&

.MARINE...
(Today through Thursday)
Issued at 341 AM PST Sat Dec 27 2025

Very rough seas will begin to diminish this morning due to a
combination of westerly swell and leftover southerly wind waves.
Hazardous marine conditions will continue through the weekend with
conditions improving by Monday. High pressure and dry weather
return for the weekend and early next week.
