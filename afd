Area Forecast Discussion...UPDATED
National Weather Service San Francisco CA
841 AM PST Mon Feb 24 2025

...New UPDATE, MARINE...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 235 AM PST Mon Feb 24 2025

Cloudy today with light showers possible for the North Bay. Then, a
warming and drying trend through midweek where high temperatures
are roughly 10 to 15 degrees above their seasonal normals. The next
chance for widespread rain may occur over the weekend.

.UPDATE...
Issued at 832 AM PST Mon Feb 24 2025

The inherited forecast is in good shape, with just a couple of
tweaks to the sensible weather elements needed. Observations
within the Bay Area and a few locales across the Central Coast
have observed a few hundredths of an inch of rain this morning.
This is due to patchy drizzle/very light rain as diffuse ascent
acts upon an airmass characterized by dry air within the
925mb-700mb and moist layers near the surface and above 700mb.
Because the entire column is unlikely to saturate, I`ve inserted
a mention of patchy drizzle as opposed to light rain across the
Bay Area this morning. Ascent is expected to subside, albeit
temporarily, through mid-morning.

As the more potent upper trough, responsible for the stormy
conditions in the PacNW, continues to move eastward we`ll see rain
chances across the region increase. While the nose of a 100+ knot
upper jet is displaced from CA, there will be enough synoptic
scale ascent in tandem orographic effects for more measurable
rainfall, especially across the North Bay where PoPs range
between 30-60%. HREF Probability Matched Mean appears to capture
measurable rainfall with both this morning`s drizzle and late
morning/afternoon QPF. In general, the highest QPF over the next
24 hours will be across the North Bay with values between a few
hundredths of an inch to near two-tenths of an inch. Farther south
toward the Central Coast, some locations (largely along the coast
and in the higher terrain) are anticipated to see a few
hundredths of an inch due to less tropospheric moisture and
ascent.

An ill-defined frontal boundary will slide southward through the
region today. While the CAA magnitude isn`t particularly
impressive in the model progs, it does appear that you`ll notice
the chill on Tuesday morning. Overnight lows tonight may be around
5 to 10 degrees lower than what we`ve experienced this past
weekend, so bundle up on Tuesday morning. We`ll examine a
noteworthy warming trend this weekend, as well as our next
opportunities for more widespread rainfall and a more active
weather pattern next week.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 235 AM PST Mon Feb 24 2025

An upper level low will track into the PacNW today, with the best
chances for rain occuring well to our north. The North Bay counties
may get be able to squeeze some moisture out of this system, with a
valleys potentially seeing a few hundredths of an inch and up to 0.15
inches for the coastal ranges up there. Elsewhere, dry weather
persists with partly to mostly cloudy skies. Opted to take a mix of
yesterday`s temps and blend it with the NBM for today to get
slightly warmer temperatures for areas near the Central Coast. These
and other areas could be at risk depending on how cloudy skies
remain throughout the day.

&&

.LONG TERM...
(Tuesday through Sunday)
Issued at 235 AM PST Mon Feb 24 2025

Upper level zonal flow through Tuesday with ridging building in for
Wednesday. This will lead to warm and dry days through at least
Wednesday. By Thursday, ridging noeses into NV due to an upper level
trough closing off and sliding into CA. Cluster analysis favors the
low over southern CA, while the deterministic still vary from
Central Coast to southern CA. Opted to go with a drier forecast for
Thu given the trends, keeping PoP confined to the ocean or Central
Coast for the most part. The next chance for widespread rain looks
to be over the weekend.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 426 AM PST Mon Feb 24 2025

Mix of low cigs and vis through this morning nearly across the
board. Complicated vis forecast early in the TAF period as many
terminals are bouncing between VLIFR/IFR. A weak disturbance
moving through will mix the lower atmosphere a bit this morning
and should raise cigs a bit after sunrise, along with some light
virga across the Bay Area and Monterey Bay. Slight chance that
some of the showers reach the ground, but overall not expected to
be impactful to operations.

Vicinity of SFO...Mixed conditions this morning as a weak
disturbance moves through. IFR cigs should start to lift around
the 16Z hour with VFR conditions expected through the evening
afterwards. MVFR cigs possible towards the end of the TAF period
but confidence remains low at this time. Moderate west to
northwest winds are expected to return midday with lighter, more
variable winds overnight.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...IFR cigs through this morning, mixing out
to VFR after sunrise. Winds most light and onshore. Moderate
confidence in the return of MVFR cigs this evening.

&&

.MARINE...
(Today through Saturday)
Issued at 832 AM PST Mon Feb 24 2025

Isolated showers and drizzle continue over the coastal waters,
coming to an end by this evening. Moderate northwesterly swell
returns to the coastal waters today into Wednesday, bringing with
it waves between 10 to 14 feet at about 14 seconds. This will
create rough seas and hazardous conditions for small crafts across
the coastal waters Monday morning through midweek.
