.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 301 AM PDT Thu Oct 12 2023


The steady warming trend continues through Friday as high
pressure build. Rain chances return Friday evening into early
Saturday for the North Bay. Confidence is increasing for
additional rain early in the next work week, but again focused on
the North Bay.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 301 AM PDT Thu Oct 12 2023

Thursday is setting up to be an average fall day for the CWA. The
lingering breezy conditions that were widespread yesterday will
finally ease in the late morning. Expect a sunny and mild
afternoon with highs randing from the 60s along the coast to the
low 80s for the warmest interior areas. Expect a mostly clear
night to follow with widespread lows in the 50s, aside from a few
of the North Bay interior areas, which will fall into the 40s.

.LONG TERM...
(Friday through Wednesday)
Issued at 301 AM PDT Thu Oct 12 2023

Friday afternoon will offer more of the same with slightly warmer
conditions, but things change up later that evening. A cold front
will approach the region bringing in plenty of cloud cover and
some breezier wind. Rain chances look to only focus on the North
Bay with only some minor hints of drizzle for areas farther to the
south. Rain totals in the Bay will range from 0.01" to 0.15" for
much of the area and up to 0.25" for higher elevations along the
Sonoma Coast.

Rain chances will keep the North Bay cooler for Saturday, but the
cooler airmass behind the front will still offer some cooling for
areas that fail to see precip.

Temperatures rebound Sunday and warm even further for Monday
before the next front enters the region.

The overnight forecast update did some tooling with the early week
frontal passage, with models hinting at a slight slowdown in
momentum as it pushes inland along the Oregon coast. For this
portion of the region, the results look very similar to what is
expected from the Friday night front: precip staying in the North
Bay.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 301 AM PDT Thu Oct 12 2023


VFR through the TAF period. Wind reduce overnight and become light
into the morning. Expect moderate to breezy westerly winds to
develop Thursday afternoon before reducing later that night.


Vicinity of SFO...VFR through the TAF period. Winds remain moderate
at SFO into the morning, before becoming light for much of the
morning. Winds pick up Thursday afternoon with gusts above 20 kts
expected to last into the night.


SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO

Monterey Bay Terminals...VFR through the TAF period. Winds stay
light to moderate through the morning before increasing slightly for
the afternoon and evening.

.MARINE...
Issued at 301 AM PDT Thu Oct 12 2023

The Stronger northwest winds will reduce into the late morning and
will ease for the afternoon. Very rough seas will slowly abate
through Friday.

Looking ahead, moderate swell will arrive this weekend before
higher, longer period swell from the remnants of Typhoon Bolaven
arrives by late next week.

&&

.FIRE WEATHER...
Issued at 301 AM PDT Thu Oct 12 2023

Surface high pressure building near the CA/OR border and surface low
pressure off the SoCal coast will lead to a brief period of elevated
fire weather concerns this morning. The orientation of the high
and low pressure will result in increasing northerly flow this
evening through early tomorrow. Northerly winds 10-20 mph with
gusts 30-40 mph will be possible over the higher terrain of the
North Bay and East Bay. Winds will be locally breezy to gusty over
the Santa Cruz and Santa Lucia Mt ranges too, but not as strong.
Fortunately, humidity values for the North Bay, East Bay, and
Santa Cruz Mts do not reach critical levels. However, higher
portions of the Santa Lucia range reach near critical humidity
values(30-40 percent) with breezy conditions. Not strong to
warrant a Red Flag warning, but near critical to warrant elevated
fire weather concerns. Additionally, recent rains/drizzle have
helped to bring fuel moistures up with lower ERC values. These
increased winds look to diminish into the afternoon, easing fire
concerns.
