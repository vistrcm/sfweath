...New AVIATION...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 222 AM PDT Fri Nov 1 2024

An incoming cold front will bring widespread rainfall Friday
afternoon into Saturday afternoon. A warming and drying trend kicks
off Sunday and continues into next week.

&&

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and Saturday) Issued at 222 AM PDT Fri Nov 1 2024

A low pressure system off the United States/Canada border will be
responsible for conditions the next two days. As this low pressure
system occludes over the next 24 hours, a jet stream supported
surface low pressure system and its associated cold front will
bring widespread rainfall to the region. While the essentials for
thunderstorms (lift, instability, and moisture) will be present,
they will not coincide at the same time and they will only be
marginal at best. Forecast soundings are suggesting many
inhibiting factors: conditionally unstable lapse rates of -6.5
degrees C/km, dry air in the mid-levels, and cloud processes set
to take place below the freezing level, thus no ice to generate a
thunderstorm. Instead, the main threat supported by the
environment will be locally heavy rain. As this is one of the
first rains of the season, roads will be slick due to oil and
water separation. Allow extra time if driving Friday or Saturday
and always remember to have your headlights on if your windshield
wipers are in use. It is important to note that the rains on
Friday and Saturday will not be fire season ending.

.LONG TERM...
(Sunday through Thursday) Issued at 222 AM PDT Fri Nov 1 2024

Fire weather concerns will immediately increase Sunday as the
clusters are in consensus of ridging over the Eastern Pacific Ocean
and troughing over the Great Plains Sunday through Tuesday. This
pattern will support a warming and drying trend with above normal
temperatures and strong and gusty northerly/offshore winds. Come
Wednesday, clusters are 50/50 on the solution. Worst case scenario
is a cutoff low developing over the Arizona/California/Nevada border
region, this would result in stronger offshore flow. Best case
scenario is the reinforcing trough remains progressive and exits to
the east, this would result in weaker offshore flow. Cold conditions
will be felt across the region during the overnight periods as
offshore flow disrupts the marine layer and longwave radiation is
able to take place under clear skies.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 426 AM PDT Fri Nov 1 2024

Mostly VFR to start the day, under increasing high cloud cover.
Starting in the afternoon, the cold front mentioned above will
push through from north to south. This will impact aviation
weather with shifting wind directions (generally from NW to SW),
MVFR ceilings, and periods of reduced visibility in rain showers.
After the front passes, the skies will clear and winds will return
to the standard NW direction.

Vicinity of SFO...90% chance of VFR conditions through the
morning before the weather slowly rolls in. Winds will begin to
shift from W to SW in the afternoon as the lower VFR ceilings
arrive. As the cold front approaches overnight, MVFR ceilings,
gusty winds and a few rain showers are expected. By dawn on
Saturday morning, the rain will stop and winds will return to a
westerly direction.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...High confidence VFR conditions through
the majority of the day. The cold front will take longer to reach
the southern terminals around the Monterey Bay. This will allow
VFR conditions to persist through the first half of the night or
so. In the meantime, drainage winds will flip to onshore in the
mid to late morning at both MRY and SNS. MVFR clouds associated
with the cold front shouldn`t arrive until the overnight hours
with rain showers arriving Saturday morning.

&&

.MARINE...
(Today through Wednesday)
Issued at 306 AM PDT Fri Nov 1 2024

Buoys are reporting rough seas on an abating trend this morning.
This reprieve will be short lived. SW winds will increase to a
moderate to fresh breeze ahead of a cold frontal passage this
afternoon. This system will bring showers and gusty winds across
the marine zones. Behind the front, winds will shift to a fresh NW
breeze and persist through the night. By Saturday afternoon, the
gradient will tighten, and NNW winds will increase to a strong
breeze with possible gale force gusts through Sunday, rebuilding
very rough seas in the outer zones.
