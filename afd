...New AVIATION...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 255 AM PDT Mon Jun 5 2023

An upper level low spinning offshore from SoCal will bring cooler,
unsettled weather to our region for the first half of this
week. Expecting showers and potential thunderstorms for Monday
into Tuesday. Expect drier conditions for the latter part of the
week, however, the lingering low will maintain below normal
temperatures.

&&

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and Tuesday)
Issued at 255 AM PDT Mon Jun 5 2023

Looking at water vapor satellite imagery, the upper level low is
rotating with its center about 200 miles offshore between LA and
San Diego. High clouds from that low are wrapping around counter
clockwise and streaming across Central CA. Cooler air will be
advecting into our region today and those inland areas that were
fairly warm to toasty yesterday should see a good 5 to 10 degree
drop for afternoon highs today.

As the day progresses, mid-level moisture will increase and
instability will also increase making it possible for showers
along with the potential for thunderstorms. Looking at hi-res
models plus the ECMWF and GFS...they are all indicating that the
first shower activity could brush the very southern portion of
Monterey County during the late morning/early afternoon hours.
It`s not until late afternoon/evening hours that convection could
move into the rest of Central CA, then progress into the Bay Area
tonight. The most unstable window looks to be Monday evening
through Tuesday morning. Total Totals Index has been consistently
showing values in the 40 to 50+ range across all the models for
Monday into Tuesday. The NBM also increased it`s Potential for
Thunderstorms during that timeframe ranging 15-35 percent...those
higher values of 25-35% are concentrated in Central CA. SPC
continues to show much of our region in their Convective Outlook
for Monday and Tuesday within their general thunderstorm category.
Thus, confidence continues to increase in this convective
forecast.

As for rainfall totals, the range is from a few hundredths up to
a half inch. Once again, the higher totals will be concentrated in
Central CA as Monterey and San Benito counties could have more
widespread values from 0.1" to 0.3" with some higher terrain
reaching up towards a half inch. For the Bay Area, amounts will
generally be around a tenth of an inch or less. Keep in mind that
localized areas in our CWA impacted by thunderstorms could get
higher amounts from moderate to heavy downpours.

Across our CWA, the NAM and HRRR hi-res models are suggesting that
shower activity should diminish by late Tuesday morning. Some wrap
around moisture may continue to bring brief showers Tuesday
afternoon into Wednesday morning, but they should be more isolated
in nature.

Thunderstorm Safety: Please remember to take shelter if you hear
thunder or see lightning as you will be withing striking distance.
It`s likely that small hail could accompany these thunderstorms
along with gusty winds and brief heavier downpours. All these
factors add up to dangerous road conditions, so slow down and give
extra space between vehicles.

.LONG TERM...
(Wednesday through Sunday) Issued at 255 AM PDT Mon Jun 5 2023

The upper level low will linger over SoCal as it moves inland for
the second half of the week and eventually weakens as it opens up
into a broader trough pattern by Thursday/Friday. Cooler than
normal temperatures will persist in the extended forecast ranging
anywhere from 5 to 15 degrees below normal.

Extended models (ensemble and deterministic GFS & ECMWF) are
indicating that another closed upper low could move over CA this
weekend which may bring additional light rain, but will have to
monitor forecast trends to see if this comes to fruition.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 511 AM PDT Mon Jun 5 2023

A mix of VFR, IFR, and LIFR conditions across the region with mostly
North Bay, Monterey Bay, and East Bay holding the IFR/LIFR cigs.
High confidence clearing will start to occur throughout the region
near 16-18Z as diurnal heating takes into effect by mixing out some
of the lower stratus to VFR conditions, except for Monterey Bay.
Wind direction varies throughout the region as the low pressure
system creates some disruption, but expect winds to transition into
breezy winds this morning into the afternoon with chances of gusty
winds up to 24 knots. Moderate confidence on gusty winds will linger
throughout the TAF period for some of the terminals, but expect
breezy conditions through out tonight into Tuesday morning. Expect
chances of showers throughout the region starting tonight into early
tomorrow morning.

Vicinity of SFO...VFR with chances of MVFR as satellite shows
some stratus traveling towards the terminal. High confidence that
VFR conditions will return near 18Z with MVFR conditions returning
tonight. Showers are expected to enter the SF Bay around 10Z.
Models showed a bit of variation on wind direction and speed, but
expect winds to remain S/SW with winds increasing towards the
afternoon with chances of gusty winds of 24 knots.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...IFR conditions but stratus is expected to
lift to MVFR cigs near 16-19Z. KMRY may see improvements sooner than
19Z so will monitor for any changes to the TAF is needed. MVFR
conditions are expected to prevail through the TAF period. Chances
of lower ceilings of LIFR and IFR is possible for tonight into
Tuesday morning but had low confidence to include. Winds are
expected to become gusty up to 18 knots near the early afternoon
today.

.MARINE...
(Today through Saturday)
Issued at 255 AM PDT Mon Jun 5 2023

In the northern outer waters, gusty northwest winds will diminish
by Monday afternoon. Southerly winds start to increase this
afternoon with gusty winds impacting the San Francisco and
Monterey Bays producing hazardous wind waves for small craft.
Gusty southerly winds will also impact the inner coastal waters
from Elkhorn Slough south to Point Sur. Showers and possible
thunderstorms Monday into Tuesday. Longer period southerly swell
continues through much of the week, alongside moderate period
northerly swell from 8 to 10 seconds.
