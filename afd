...New UPDATE, MARINE...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 207 AM PST Sun Jan 26 2025

Scattered showers and low chance for convection continue today
across the Central Coast, along with gusty winds in the North Bay
interior mountains. Chilly morning temperatures continue through
the later part of the week when the next rain chances arrive.

&&

.UPDATE...
Issued at 836 AM PST Sun Jan 26 2025

Isolated to scattered rain showers and high elevation snow showers
persist over the Central Coast this morning and will continue
throughout the afternoon before tapering off this evening. There is
the potential for some convection with the greatest threat being
occasional lightning strikes and small hail through the afternoon.
The Frost Advisory will be allowed to expire and 9 AM and we will
cancel the Wind Advisory an hour early as winds in the highest
elevations of the North Bay Interior Mountains continue to ease.
Otherwise, no other updates are anticipated this morning as the
forecast remains on track.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 207 AM PST Sun Jan 26 2025

Radar products show scattered showers circulating across a low
pressure system located off the coast of Davenport. Rain totals have
been generally light with totals topping out around 0.4" in the
mountains of Monterey and San Benito Counties, some scattered
wetting rains elsewhere in the Central Coast (0.22" at the Monterey
Airport over the past 24 hours from midnight) and generally a few
hundredths in favored locations across the Bay Area. A couple of
reports of small hail have also come in tonight, one from Monterey
and one from the Santa Cruz Mountains near Ben Lomond.

The rest of today will be dominated by convectively driven showers
across the Central Coast as the low pressure system moves off to our
south. The SPC has placed most of Monterey and San Benito Counties
in a general threat for thunderstorms through the day today, with
the threat generally expected to last until the evening hours as the
low moves to the south of Monterey County and daytime heating ends.
Cold temperatures aloft are promoting steep low level lapse rates,
and there is some decent instability on the southern side of the low
pressure system. The 00Z sounding from Oakland yesterday afternoon
measured a 850 mb temperature of -0.9 degrees Celsius, which is
right around the 10th percentile temperature for this time of year.
The 00Z sounding at the Vandenberg SFB (thought to be more
representative of conditions at the Central Coast) shows a MUCAPE
value of around 250 J/kg; for context, the 90th percentile MUCAPE
value is around 70 J/kg this time of year. The main convective
threats will be locally heavy rain and small hail. Rain totals will
very considerably depending on where showers do pop up, but favored
locations could see around 0.25-0.5" of rain, and the highest peaks
could see an additional 2-3" of snow.

Heading into the North Bay, the main threat will be lingering gusty
offshore winds across the interior mountains. Wind gusts this
morning could reach 35-40 mph across the ridgelines before the
southward motion of the low relaxes the pressure gradient, helping
to calm some of the gusty winds. The operations team considered
ending the Wind Advisory currently in effect across the North Bay
interior mountains earlier this evening, but opted to continue the
Advisory until it was clear that winds would no longer be a threat.

Finally, the cold core low will reinforce the chilly and potentially
dangerous night time temperatures across the region. A Frost
Advisory is in effect now through 9 AM for the southern Salinas
Valley, the Santa Lucias, the interior mountains of Monterey and San
Benito County, the eastern Santa Clara hills, and the East Bay
Hills. Low temperatures this morning drop into the low to mid 30s
across the warned area. Elsewhere lows range from the middle to
upper 30s in the inland regions, and the low to mid 40s closer to
the coast. Highs today range from the middle 50s to near 60s in the
lower elevations, to the 40s and the upper 30s in the higher
elevations.

.LONG TERM...
(Monday through Saturday)
Issued at 207 AM PST Sun Jan 26 2025

Dry weather returns on Monday and sticks around through at least the
mid-week as ridging returns to the region. Daytime highs warm to
near the seasonal averages across the lower elevations, around the
middle 50s to lower 60s. However, clear skies and light winds will
promote radiational cooling and lead to potential hazardous
conditions. Lows in the lower to middle 30s in the inland valleys
and the upper 30s into the lower 40s for the coastal regions have
resulted in the continuation of a Freeze Watch for all of the inland
Bay Area and Central Coast from Monday morning to Wednesday morning.
It`s likely that Frost Advisories and Freeze Warnings will need to
be issued for Monday morning after the current Frost Advisory
expires. Remember the Four P`s of Winter Weather:

People: Dress in layers and wear a hat that covers the ears. Pay
special attention to children and the elderly, who are more
vulnerable to the cold.
Plants: Bring potted plants indoors and keep outdoor plants and
trees protected.
Pets: Bring all pets indoors. Pets and other animals that have to be
kept outdoors should have an enclosed shelter.
Pipes: Make sure all external water pipes are insulated. Keep an
interior faucet running at a drip to prevent ice buildup.

Confidence is increasing for potential rainfall starting Friday into
the weekend, but it`s still too early to pin down any specifics. The
key factor is the interaction between an incoming Pacific trough
with the ridge set up across the western US. Analysis of the
ensemble model clusters reveals that around 80% of the ensemble
members from the American GEFS, Canadian GEPS, and European EPS
ensemble models support some form of ridging that lingers into
Friday, which would limit the rainfall totals across the area. The
remaining 20% support more aggressive development of the trough
into the western US, which would bring more substantial rainfall
totals to the region. Similar levels of uncertainty persist into
the weekend, and by Monday, the chances for a very impactful
system or lighter, mainly beneficial rain are practically 50-50.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 408 AM PST Sun Jan 26 2025

An upper level low pressure system will slowly meander southward
today. This will lead to a mix of sun and clouds across the region,
with showers lingering through the day. The best chances for rain
showers will be from SFO southward, primarily favoring the Central
Coast terminals. Isolated rumbles of thunder will be possible
through this afternoon for sites in Monterey and San Benito
counties. VFR conditions are expected to prevail; however, should a
shower move over a terminal or airfield, lowered cig and vis are
possible. In addition to showers, gusty offshore flow will be
possible across the North Bay beginning late this morning and
continuing through the afternoon.

Vicinity of SFO...Satellite and radar imagery shows an upper level
low spinning over Central Coast. Light showers have started to
develop this morning and are trying to hold together as they move in
from the valley. Timing from the 0Z update seems to be on point,
with the best chances for showers happening between 12Z-18Z. Should
a shower clip SFO, reduced cigs and vis are possible perhaps down to
IFR based on observations around the area. As the low meanders
south, winds are forecast to become onshore and skies will gradually
clear.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...No major changes to the forecast since the
last update. Radar shows isolated to scattered showers just offshore
or to the east of the KMRY and KSNS in Monterey and San Benito
counties. Chances for showers increase over the next few hours, as
sunlight will reinvigorate the atmosphere. Should we get enough
instability, isolated thunderstorms will be possible where a brief
period of heavy rain, small hail, or perhaps gusty and erratic
winds would be possible. Confidence remains too low, at about 15% or
less, to add any mention of TS, -TSRA, or VCTS to the TAF sites, but
it should be noted we have seen a few strikes or pulses over the
Pacific. Precip and thunder chances wind down through the afternoon,
with skies gradually clearing.

.MARINE...
(Today through Friday)
Issued at 836 AM PST Sun Jan 26 2025

An upper level low will gradually exit the region today. Isolated
showers and thunderstorms remain for the Central Coast and
adjacent  waters, mainly south of Point Sur. Rough seas and gusty
winds  will gradually improve by Monday with dry weather to
prevail  through the week as high pressure builds. Unsettled
weather looks to return to the coastal waters late week.

.MTR WATCHES/WARNINGS/ADVISORIES...
CA...Freeze Watch from late tonight through Thursday morning for
     CAZ504-506-508-510-512>518-528>530.

PZ...Small Craft Advisory until 9 AM PST this morning for Pigeon Pt
     to Pt Pinos 10-60 NM-SF Bay N of Bay Bridge.
