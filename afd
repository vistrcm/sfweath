...New AVIATION, BEACHES...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 351 AM PST Tue Feb 6 2024

Scattered showers and isolated thunderstorms continue today but
mostly focused over the Central Coast. Another weak weather system
will bring light rain Wednesday. A drier trend but seasonably cool
weather continues Thursday and Friday. High pressure builds over the
weekend with dry and mild weather returning.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 352 AM PST Tue Feb 6 2024

The Flood Warning for Santa Rosa, Rohnert Park, Windsor,
Sebastopol, Cotati, Roseland, Larkfield-Wikiup, South Santa Rosa
Cdp, Forestville and Graton was allowed to expire 3 am. Water
levels in the creeks and streams are decreasing.

A Coastal Flood Advisory remains in effect for San Francisco,
along the San Francisco Bay Shoreline and nearby valleys of the
North Bay from 6 am today to 10 Saturday for tidal levels running
up to 1.5 feet higher than tidal predictions. Flooding is most
likely from 6 am to 10 am daily.

Will be looking at issuing a Beach Hazards Statement for the entire
coast from Sonoma County through Monterey County for the current time
to 4 am Wednesday.

The center of a deep, nearly stationary long wave trough remains
located over the CA coastal and nearby offshore waters. Well below
early Feb normal 500 mb heights and temperatures vicinity Oakland
are forecast near 544 decameters and -28 Celsius today (not far
from, but just above the Oakland upper air sounding min moving
average for Feb 6th 538 decameters and -32 Celsius respectively).
Sure enough KMUX continues to show scattered showers overnight due
to colder air aloft; the surface based convective potential from
both an upward flux of energy from solar heated surface warming and
milder sea surface temperatures continue through today. A compact
500 mb shortwave trough to our northwest moves quickly south-
southeastward reaching our forecast area by late tonight (and
Wednesday) bringing more mainly light rain.

.LONG TERM...
(Tuesday night through next Sunday)
Issued at 135 PM PST Mon Feb 5 2024

Following the 18z NAM model guidance we expect a relatively weak
and more typical mid-winter area of low pressure to bring renewed
light rainfall to the region on Wednesday. This system will be
coming from the northwest and is not any type of AR system. Expect
light rain to sweep from north to south through the day Weds
dropping a tenth to quarter inch of rainfall under a stratiform
rainfall pattern. The Weds system will spread clouds across the
region in the morning meaning another mostly cloudy and cool day
with highs struggling to reach the lower 50s as snow levels fall
to around 3500 feet on average.

The pattern starts to change on Thursday but one last shortwave
will keep light shower chances in the forecast on Thursday as cool
northerly flow develops over the region. This will keep daytime
highs cool in the lower 50s with overnight lows dropping into the
30s and lower 40s as we could see less cloud cover by Thursday
night into Friday morning.

High pressure slowly builds Friday afternoon through the weekend
with a noted warming trend and plenty of sunshine with mild
afternoon temps back into the 60s. Some hints that as we head
towards Presidents weekend the pattern could get active again so
take the weekend to cleanup and prep for more potential storms the
second half of Feb into March.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 410 AM PST Tue Feb 6 2024

VFR remains through the TAF period for the majority of terminals.
The exception to this is KSTS where MVFR conditions are expected to
last through the late morning as a result of fog obscuring
visibilities. Scattered showers will continue to pass through the
region this morning, so have included VCSH in the TAF to reflect
this. Generally moderate NW winds are expected today below 10 knots.
Into the early morning of Wednesday, winds increase to become breezy
and gusty.


Vicinity of SFO...Mid level clouds continue to pass through the
region, though conditions are expected to remain VFR. Some models
hint towards MVFR CIGs developing near sunrise, though confidence in
this is low at this time. Highest confidence is in maintaining VFR
through the TAF period. Winds breezy out of the NW this afternoon,
then becoming gusty into the early morning of Wednesday around 18-
20 knots.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...VFR through the TAF period, with scattered
showers lingering through this morning. Low clouds may develop over
the KMRY terminal this morning, though not expecting an MVFR CIG to
form. Otherwise, current light and variable winds. Winds increase
this afternoon out of the W/NW but remain below 10 knots.

.MARINE...
(Today through Sunday)
Issued at 251 AM PST Tue Feb 6 2024

Light to moderate northwesterly winds continue over the coastal
waters through the late morning today, then increasing to become
fresh and gusty into the afternoon. Gusty northwesterly winds last
through at least Wednesday. Scattered showers continue through
the day today, with the next best chances of widespread rain
approaching the area on Wednesday. A long period northwest swell
train arrives today and lasts through the end of the work week.

&&

.BEACHES...
Issued at 410 AM PST Tue Feb 6 2024

Large and longer period swell throughout the coastal waters will
bring an increased sneaker wave threat to area beaches. Breaking
waves up to 10 feet are possible through late tonight. A Beach
Hazards Statement is in effect now through late tonight for the
entirety of the CWA`s coastline. Sneaker waves can sweep across
beaches and pull people into the water without warning. Remember
to never turn your back on the ocean!
