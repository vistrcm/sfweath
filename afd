...New SHORT TERM...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 404 AM PDT Thu Aug 17 2023

An unsettled weather pattern is expected through early next week
with cooler temperatures, more cloud cover, and chances for
showers and isolated thunderstorms. The greatest rain chances
should be from late Sunday into early Tuesday.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 500 AM PDT Thu Aug 17 2023

Today will bring another round of consistent weather similar to
previous days as the upper level influence continues to drive a
slight chance of convective activity over the Diablo Range and
Mayacamas mountains for this afternoon. Global models show an
increase of vorticity in the upper level low, which supports more
instability for convective activity. Therefore, 15% chance of
showers were added into the forecast for this afternoon with slight
chance of thunder.

With the stagnant upper level low sitting off the coast, expect a
bit of cooler temperatures today with the high temperatures dropping
between 5-8 degrees across the region compared to yesterday. The
interior will reach the upper 80s to mid 90s and the coastline will
see low to mid 70s. The minimum temperatures overnight will be mid
to upper 50s near the coast and upper 50s to low 60s in the
interior. With the compressed marine layer, expect some patchy fog
along the coast this morning and tonight.

.LONG TERM...
(Friday through Wednesday)
Issued at 404 AM PDT Thu Aug 17 2023

Friday and Saturday:

High pressure aloft will shift from the Four Corners region to the
southern Great Plains while troughing deepens along the CA coast.
Tropical Cyclone Hilary should rapidly intensify while being drawn
poleward around the western ridge periphery. The storm should near,
then potentially pass over, portions of Baja California late in the
forecast period. Locally we`ll remain under the influence of the
upper trough with some increase in mid to high level clouds along
with low-end shower/storm chances given precipitable water values
around 1 inch. Orographic lift may aid in a few stronger storms over
the Diablo range on Friday afternoon and evening. Temperatures
should be seasonable.

Sunday through Wednesday:

The upper low offshore will impart a southerly steering flow on
Hilary and accelerate its poleward movement. The system should
approach SoCal near tropical storm strength on Monday before the
effects of shear, land interaction, and cooling SSTs cause its decay
and post-tropical transition. Regardless of classification, copious
tropical moisture will be drawn into the Desert Southwest and
portions of California through early to mid week. Shower and
possible thunderstorm development will occur across parts of the
region as well. There remains considerable uncertainty in local
impacts as they are highly dependent upon Hilary`s track. Based on
the latest information there appears to be three plausible forecast
outcomes for our area. They include:

1. The ridge is weaker than anticipated and Hilary tracks more to
the east. This scenario would displace the best moisture and
greatest rain chances away from us. Mostly dry conditions might even
prevail locally. This scenario is favored by some GEFS members, the
EPS mean, along with the deterministic GFS and Global Canadian models.

2. The ridge is stronger causing Hilary to track more west. This
scenario would bring deep tropical moisture into portions of our
area leading to widespread showers and locally heavy rainfall. This
scenario is favored by several EPS members, a few GEFS members, and
the deterministic UKMET.

3. A hybrid of the above, with the best moisture displaced to our
east but at least some chance for shower and isolated thunderstorm
development.

The trend over the last 4 model runs has favored the eastern side of
the guidance envelope, with the official National Hurricane Center
track shifting slightly to the right. However before reading too
much into this it`s worth noting that we`re still 4-5 days out and
that the average track error at 96 hours is around 100 nautical
miles. All of this is to say that it`s still too early to determine
the extent of local water impacts locally until the details become
clearer.

That said, a probabilistic approach from the National Blend of
Models produces a 10-20 percent chance for meeting or exceeding 1
inch of rain early next week. This potential is largely along and
southeast of the Golden Gate, with the greatest odds favoring inland
portions of the Central Coast. Based on the possibility for at least
localized flooding a marginal risk for excessive rainfall was
introduced by the Weather Prediction Center for our area on Monday.
This is a low confidence forecast however, so keep up with changes.

Temperatures should cool considerably on Monday given widespread
cloud cover and possible precipitation, with a slow warming trend
expected into mid week.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 447 AM PDT Thu Aug 17 2023

A mix of VFR/IFR/LIFR as satellite and observations show lower cigs
and low visibility mostly over North Bay and Monterey Bay terminals
as most of the region is covered with few high clouds or clear
skies. With the relatively compressed marine layer, expect LIFR
conditions to linger until 17Z for these terminals, where VFR is
expected return. Some models suggest other terminals, especially
SF Bay terminals, may transition to IFR ceilings tonight but had
low confidence to include. Therefore, expect VFR to prevail for
the remaining terminals. Otherwise, expect stratus to return to
North Bay and Monterey Bay terminals creating IFR/LIFR conditions.
Predominately onshore winds will become breezy in the afternoon,
with a return of light/moderate winds tonight. Gusty winds is
possible through coastal gaps up to 18-20 knots.

Vicinity of SFO...VFR with FEW high clouds over the terminal.
Moderate confidence that VFR will prevail through the TAF period as
models show stratus will surround the terminal near the San Bruno
gap tonight, but low confidence that low cigs will funnel over into
the terminal. Breezy onshore winds this afternoon with a chance of
gusty winds up to 20 knots with light winds returning tonight.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...LIFR with high chance that will prevail
until 17-18Z where conditions improve to VFR and onshore winds
become moderate to breezy. High confidence that LIFR conditions will
return tonight with light winds.

.MARINE...
(Today through Tuesday)
Issued at 447 AM PDT Thu Aug 17 2023

Light northwesterly winds continue across the coastal waters
through the weekend, with moderate to gusty afternoon and evening
winds expected across the San Francisco Bay and into the Delta.
Moderate period southerly swell continuing through the week with a
shorter period northwesterly swell. New northwest swell arrives
late week. Slight chances of thunderstorms exist over the northern
waters late Thursday evening, with thunderstorm chances then
progressively extending south, and covering much of the waters by
Friday afternoon. Beyond Friday evening, thunderstorm chances
diminish. Brief downpours and lightning are possible with
thunderstorms. Mariners are encouraged to exercise caution, as
locally higher winds and seas are possible near or in
thunderstorms.
