...New UPDATE, MARINE...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 1201 AM PST Sat Feb 15 2025

Dry conditions have returned and will persist through Saturday. A
pair of disturbances will bring light rain mainly to the North Bay
on Sunday and Wednesday. Otherwise the week will be mostly dry with
mild temperatures and gentle to moderate wind.

.UPDATE...
Issued at 843 AM PST Sat Feb 15 2025

Temperatures cooled into the low-to-mid 30s across the coldest
interior spots this morning where we had a Frost Advisory in effect.
Temperature continue to gradually and are likely to reach into the
upper 50s to low 60s this afternoon. As such, will let the Frost
Advisory expire at 9 AM PST. Otherwise, passing high clouds are
expected through the remainder of the afternoon with low-to-mid
level clouds potentially reaching the North Bay by this evening
ahead of a weak frontal boundary. No updates anticipated this
morning as the forecast remains on track.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 1201 AM PST Sat Feb 15 2025

Mostly clear skies tonight will support enhanced radiational
cooling. Inland areas will drop to the mid-30s, and there are a few
frost advisories in effect. As the temperature drops to the dew-
point, patchy fog will soon develop in the valleys and persist
through mid-morning. If the winds stay light, dense fog advisories
are possible. There`s even a chance for freezing fog in some of the
colder valleys. Freezing fog is made up of supercooled water
droplets (still liquid, but below freezing). These droplets freeze
instantly on contact with any surface. The biggest hazard from
freezing fog is black ice on the roadways, and icing on aircraft. If
you`re driving around the inland valleys in the morning and see fog,
be aware that the road surface may be dangerously slick. By mid-
morning, the temperature will increase enough to allow the fog to
mix-out, and the afternoon will be mild and calm. There will be
increasing high cloud cover through the day, ahead of a weak
disturbance on Sunday. These clouds could make for a good sunset
this evening.

.LONG TERM...
(Sunday through Friday)
Issued at 1201 AM PST Sat Feb 15 2025

Bottom line: the weather pattern is becoming much less active. There
are some features to track, but we don`t see any more atmospheric
rivers on the horizon.  On Sunday morning, the increasing cloud
cover will keep minimum temperatures about 5 degrees warmer than
Saturday morning, and we are not anticipating any additional frost
advisories. A weak cold front will push through Sunday. The moisture
tap for this system is from the drier west, rather than tropical SW.
That will limit the impacts, and we are only expecting a few
hundredths, mainly focused on the North Bay. In other words, Santa
Rosa is only expected to get less than 1% of the rain they received
on Thursday.

High pressure will rebuild and bring tranquil weather from Mon-Tue
before another weak disturbance moves through Wednesday. Rain
impacts from this will be similar to Sunday, though northerly winds
will be more gusty into Thursday behind the front. The uncertainty
starts to grow later in the week, but most guidance indicates a more
substantial ridging pattern will take hold, bringing relatively
benign weather any warmer than average temperatures. In the extended
forecast, dry conditions seem most likely through February, though
there are some outliers that disagree in the ensemble guidance. The
Eastern Pacific Oscillation is expected to return to the positive
phase by late this week, and remain there through the remainder of
the month. Unlike what we saw with dry January, this indicates that
the jet stream will continue to bring disturbances to the west
coast, the question is if those systems will bring rain or just
clouds.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 331 AM PST Sat Feb 15 2025

VFR conditions with light winds expected through the TAF period,
with the exception of Half Moon bay where passing LIFR ceilings
are possible. High cloud coverage will increase through the day,
with mid-level clouds approaching by the end of the TAF period.

Vicinity of SFO...High confidence in VFR conditions under high
clouds through the TAF period. Winds will remain gentle, with
diurnally driven direction changes.

SFO Bridge Approach... Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...VFR with increasing high cloud coverage
through the day. Gentle winds will switch from offshore to
onshore following the normal diurnal pattern.

.MARINE...
(Today through Thursday)
Issued at 843 AM PST Sat Feb 15 2025

Seas and winds continue to abate over the coastal waters through
the  remainder of the weekend. The next round of moderate WNW
swell  begins Monday with rough seas and locally gusty winds
expected.
