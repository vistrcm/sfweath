.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 234 AM PDT Sun Aug 20 2023

An unsettled weather pattern is expected through Monday with cooler
temperatures, more cloud cover, and increased shower chances.
This potential is greatest for inland portions of the Central
Coast and East Bay as the remnants of Tropical Cyclone Hilary
pass to our east.

&&

.SHORT TERM...
(Today)
Issued at 235 AM PDT Sun Aug 20 2023

The large-scale pattern will be quite interesting with an
anomalously strong (600 dm) high pressure ridge over the central
Great Plains and a closed upper low along the central California
coast. Hurricane Hilary will accelerate poleward and decay along
northern Baja before reaching southeast California as a Tropical
Storm. Rich tropical moisture (precipitable water values of 2-2.5
inches) will spread into the Desert Southwest as a serious flooding
situation evolves there. Closer to home we`ll remain along the
periphery of Hilary with the greatest impacts displaced to our east.
However that`s not to say that we`ll see no impact. In fact, the
overnight was a little active for inland portions of the Central
Coast. An increase in tropospheric moisture around the periphery of
Hilary met up with lift and instability around the upper low and
sparked several short-lived thunderstorms. Lightning and brief heavy
rain were the main impacts from these storms. It`s a bit quieter
now, but can`t rule out a rogue shower to two today given the moist
and conditionally unstable atmosphere. Shower chances increase for
tonight into Monday, with the greatest chances for inland portions
of the area. More on this is included in the extended forecast
discussion below. Otherwise low for temperatures today mostly in
the 70s and 80s, with a few lower 90s for the East Bay and North Bay
Valleys. Lows tonight will mostly be in the 60s. It should feel a
bit muggy as well as dewpoint temperatures hover around 60.

.LONG TERM...

No major changes to the long term forecast thinking. The previous
discussion is included below.

LONG TERM...
(Tonight through next Friday)
Issued at 153 PM PDT Sat Aug 19 2023

By Sunday evening Hurricane Hilary will have weakened to a
Tropical Storm over far SoCal per latest NHC track. Further
weakening and northerly track into NV is expected (there has be a
slight eastward shift in the overall track). Despite the
"weakening" of the storm the impacts will still be great and far
reaching over SoCal with historic rainfall expected with
dangerous to locally catastrophic flooding. Thankfully the Bay
Area and Central Coast will be spared from any major impacts, but
some precip is expected nonetheless. The current forecast will
bring more widespread showers south to north Sunday night into
Monday. Showers will be possible through day on Monday and
tapering off from west to east Monday night into Tuesday. While
the chance for showers hasn`t changed, the rainfall amounts have.
Given the slight eastward shift in the NHC track rainfall amounts
have decreased across the Bay Area and Central Coast. The highest
amounts and highest confidence location continues to be interior
CEntral Coast where rainfall totals through early Tuesday may
reach 0.25-0.5". Elsewhere, generally less than a tenth of an inch
is expected. If some of the guidance is correct it`s possible
that some areas many not see any measurable precip (10-15% of this
happening). As for temperatures, on average Monday will be much
cooler with temperatures in the 60s to 80s. It will feel muggy
too.

Tuesday and beyond...the upper low that has been hanging around
for about a week will finally exit to the northeast. In its wake
the expansive high over the center part of the CONUS nudges
westward. As a result, 500mb heights rise and so do 850mb temps.
Therefore, the marine layer will be more compressed along with a
warming and drying trend.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 515 AM PDT Sun Aug 20 2023

Expect atypical August weather especially in the finer details
pertaining to the TAFs over the next 24 hours since there`ll be a
merging consisting of the 500 mb cold core cut-off low`s energy
situated over our coastal waters and the eventual forecast
remnants of the 500 mb warm core low rapidly moving northward from
southern California. Lower level stability persists, recent
profiler data showing the marine layer maintaining so far with a
depth of 1600 feet from Bodega Bay to Point Sur. This is a very
complex forecast regarding ceilings for example since the marine
layer temperature inversion is the cap for stratus and fog. How
much wind, the type and strength of temperature advection at
various levels in the troposphere, if there`s precipitation,
virga, more mixing winds, less mixing winds, etc. all can affect
for example the areal coverage of stratus and fog, extent of IFR
vs VFR conditions, and any other developing sensible weather
conditions.

Pilots, dispatchers, expect the next 24 hours to involve potentially
quickly changing weather conditions involving ceilings and winds
mainly; please closely monitor observations, radar and satellite
through today, tonight and Monday including any potential forecast
updates even with high forecast confidence tropical moisture stays
mostly south and east of our cwa. The 12z TAFs advertise IFR for the
immediate coastline through mid to late morning, highest probability
VFR is inland. Low confidence in TAF forecasts tonight and Monday
morning.

.MARINE...
(Today through Friday)
Issued at 444 AM PDT Sun Aug 20 2023

Gusty northwesterly winds continue for the far northern outer
waters, with lighter winds continuing over the remaining coastal
waters and bays, with the San Francisco Bay becoming gusty into
the  afternoons and evenings. Southerly gales are expected to
develop over the far southern waters and Monterey Bay late
tonight and Monday. Northwesterly winds redevelop across all
coastal waters mid to late next week. Moderate period southerly
swell through the weekend alongside shorter period northwesterly
swell, with new, longer-period southerly swell arriving towards
the middle of the week.
