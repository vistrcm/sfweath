.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 209 AM PDT Sun Oct 15 2023

Patchy to areas of dense fog will continue along the coastline and
valley regions through the late morning. Slightly warmer
temperatures expected after the fog dissipates today. Brief
cooling returns on Monday as another weak cold front approaches
the North Bay. Warming trend on track for the latter half of the
week.

&&

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 209 AM PDT Sun Oct 15 2023

Night fog satellite imagery shows low clouds blanketing much of
the coast and inland valleys. Patchy to areas of fog are being
observed early this morning. Lowered visibilities of less than a
quarter statute mile is being observed for sites along the
Monterey Bay as well as Salinas and Hollister Valleys. Up along
the coast as well as North Bay valleys reporting some lowered
visibilities down to a quarter as well. Moist conditions at lower
levels, as indicated by the 00z OAK sounding, and building
geopotential heights aloft is allowing for that moist air to
compress at lower levels. Patchy to areas of dense fog will
persist through the night tonight into early morning hours Sunday.
As such, a Dense Fog Advisory has been issued for the entire
coastline from Sonoma Co down to Big Sur, the N Bay valleys, SF,
Monterey Bay region, and the northern Salinas Valley through 10 am
this morning. Will continue to monitor satellite and obs through
the early morning for the possibility of expanding the Dense Fog
Advisory to include the bay shoreline and the Santa Clara Valley,
which hi-res guidance hints may see fog in the early morning. Use
caution if driving this morning in the aforementioned regions.

Fog will dissipate by late morning but will persist near the
immediate coastline through the afternoon. Temperatures inland today
will generally be ~5 degrees warmer than yesterday as upper ridge
builds over the intermountain west. Highs will be in the upper 70s
to mid 80s across the interior with usual hot spots (such as
southern Monterey County) could see low 90s.

.LONG TERM...
(Monday through Saturday)
Issued at 209 AM PDT Sun Oct 15 2023

Upper level disturbance will move across California and the Pacific
NW early Monday into Tuesday. This will dampen upper level heights,
bringing temporarily cooler temperatures on Monday. An associated
weak cold front will approach the North Bay on Monday, which will
result in small chances for light precip across the NW portion of
Sonoma County, but any measurable rain now looks to stay over the
waters. While not overly impressive, the resultant cooldown will
be nice on Monday before temperatures rise again during the
latter half of the week.

High pressure builds in across the Western US as upper shortwave
treks east across the Canadian border beginning Tuesday of this
upcoming week. Warming trend begins Tuesday with Thursday still on
track to be the warmest day. Forecasted high temperatures are
trending warmer compared to last night`s forecast with highs
expected to be in the low to mid 90s across the interior on Thurs.
NBM is highlighting a 70-90% chance for temps above 90 degrees on
Thursday for the southern portions of the Santa Clara valley
(south of Morgan Hill), the Santa Cruz Mountains, and S Monterey
County. Lower chances but nonzero (20-30%) exist for the bay
shoreline and the interior N Bay valleys to see highs above 90 F.
Will continue to monitor elevated temperatures and HeatRisk
through the coming days.

Temperatures cool back down this upcoming weekend as upper trough is
expected to move inland.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 439 AM PDT Sun Oct 15 2023

Visibility conditions are worsening early this morning as dense
fog covers much of the coastline and coastal valleys. Lower visbys
of 1/2 SM to 2 SM has been spreading through the San Pablo Bay
and Suisun Bays and could soon fill into Napa Valley and East Bay
valleys. Guidance has been advertising these lower visbys
spreading to the SF Bay south of the Bay Bridge before and during
sunrise. With dense fog and low cigs, IFR- LIFR conditions prevail
across much of the taf sites through 16z-19z. VFR returns after
19z across the area, but low clouds will linger close to the
coastline.

This afternoon, light to breezy onshore winds will resume. Low
clouds will return this evening to the Monterey Bay region and
later in the night for SF Bay Area terminals. Moderate confidence
of cig height as compression should take place today with building
high pressure, but another weak cold front will approach the
North Bay by early Monday (end of TAF period).

Vicinity of SFO...IFR cigs currently at KSFO while LIFR persists
at KOAK as cigs have lowered to 300 feet AGL. TEMPO included for LIFR
conditions possible at KSFO between 13z and 16z. VFR expected to
return between 18z-19z today. Onshore flow of 10 to 15 knots
expected this afternoon. Low clouds return tonight but confidence
of timing of its return as well as cig height are low at this
time.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO. Low clouds persist over SMB.

Monterey Bay Terminals...LIFR conditions with patchy dense fog 530.

     Beach Hazards Statement through late tonight for CAZ006-505-509-
     530.

PZ...Dense Fog Advisory until 11 AM PDT this morning for PZZ530.

     Dense Fog Advisory until 10 AM PDT this morning for PZZ535.

     Small Craft Advisory from 3 AM to 3 PM PDT Monday for PZZ565.
