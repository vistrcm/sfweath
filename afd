.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 335 AM PST Wed Jan 17 2024

Showers ending over the southern forecast area this morning. Low
clouds and patchy fog this morning, partial clearing later today.
Dry weather Thursday then rain and gusty winds arrive Friday and
Friday night with another chance of rain and gusty winds Sunday
and Sunday night.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 358 AM PST Wed Jan 17 2024

Showers are steadily ending over the southern forecast area early
this morning. In the wake of wet weather, many locations have low
clouds and somewhat reduced visibilities in mist/fog. A plume of
1.22" precipitable water arrived Tuesday per 00z (4 pm PST)
Oakland upper air sounding, which is near the long term maximum
moving average in mid January. It was a decent rain from north to
south Tuesday and it has left the boundary layer nearly saturated,
thus may see more mist/fog developing through morning. Otherwise
expect a break in the rain, partial clearing occuring later today.
Clearing could be slow going over the North Bay valleys. Daytime
highs reaching the upper 50s to lower 60s except a few mid 60s
southern interior Monterey county. Areas of fog developing tonight
and Thursday morning.

.LONG TERM...
(Thursday through Tuesday)
Issued at 358 AM PST Wed Jan 17 2024

A mainly weak high pressure system Thursday results in another
day of dry weather. Thereafter a strong, zonally merged polar and
subtropical jet stream across much of the Pacific basin, including
lower level warm air advection and a subtropical water vapor tap
will bring a couple focused iterations of rain to the Bay Area and
north Central Coast one on Friday and another Sunday. A hydrologic
outlook (WMO header FGUS76) was issued to highlight moderate to
potentially rapid rises along area rivers, streams and creeks.
Rainfall totals ranging 1.5" to 3" across most areas with 3" to 5"
over the North Bay and locally to 5" to 7" over favored peaks and
higher terrain of the North Bay. Rain totals 4" to 6" over the
Santa Cruz and Santa Lucia Mountains.

In between Friday`s and Sunday`s frontal systems ongoing onshore
winds, orographic lifting and cooling will favor light rain
especially along south to southwest facing slopes. Plan on dismal,
wet weather this weekend. Breezy to gusty southerly winds also
arrive Friday and Friday night and again Sunday and Sunday night.
It`s worth noting the core of the jet stream winds across the
western and central Pacific is broadly cyclonic (a little southward
by 3 or 4 degrees latitude relative to January climatology)
causing the eastern Pacific jet to broadly ridge by a similar
amount northward in latitude. Therefore the front end of the jet
stream will indirectly aim for California rather taking a path
toward the Baja Peninsula through late week and weekend. This may
explain why the GFS and ECMWF integrated water vapor transport
(IVT) forecasts are mainly weak (and discontinuous) from Friday
through Monday. The overall effect of this synoptic pattern may
help land us with primarily beneficial rains (vs hazardous
conditions). Ensemble EPS rainfall amounts have trended near
steady through early next week, while GEFS has trended a little
lower. Max GFS precipitable water forecasts are 0.90" to 1.1",
still a little greater than 90th percentile.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 420 AM PST Wed Jan 17 2024

Fog and mist obscuring visibilities in North Bay terminals this
morning is expected to subside into the late morning. Scattered LIFR-
MVFR conditions are present across the region this morning in the
wake of Tuesday`s rain showers. However, into the late morning, VFR
is expected to return to all terminals, with just FEW low to mid
level clouds present. Winds expected to be generally light and
onshore this afternoon, becoming more variable into the nighttime
hours. Into the early morning hours of Thursday, some hints at the
return of fog and lowered visibilities exist for the North Bay and
KLVK terminals.


Vicinity of SFO...MVFR conditions improve to become VFR into the
late morning today as CIGs lift, with VFR lasting through the end of
the TAF period. Winds onshore around 8 knots last into the evening,
then becoming light into the nighttime hours.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...MVFR/IFR conditions last through the late
morning today as a result of fog and low CIGs. Moderate SE drainage
winds at KSNS ease as VFR conditions return towards 19Z, turning to
become onshore into the afternoon and evening. VFR lasts through the
end of the TAF period for most terminals, though confidence on this
is moderate for KSNS, as some models suggest IFR conditions
developing as a result of fog. However, have left out of the TAF for
now as the return of moderate SE drainage winds may inhibit fog
formation.

.MARINE...
(Today through Monday)
Issued at 222 AM PST Wed Jan 17 2024

Rain has exited much of the region, with only a few scattered
showers over the far southern waters. Gentle NW winds persist
through at least Thursday afternoon, turning to become southerly
and fresh into Thursday evening ahead of the next rain showers.
Into Friday, a more active pattern begins, resulting in strong and
gusty southerly winds and rough seas, persisting through the
weekend.
