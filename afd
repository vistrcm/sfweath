...New AVIATION...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 254 AM PDT Fri Jul 21 2023

High pressure causes peak temperatures of the forecast today and
tomorrow. Heat Advisories go effect for the warmest inland areas
today and last through Saturday. Cooling trend is expected to
start on sunday as a troughing pattern takes over.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 254 AM PDT Fri Jul 21 2023

Pockets of coastal and valley fog will linger for the first part
of the morning but looks to clear as the lower clouds thin. This
will lead into a sunny day with temperatures quick to rise into
the afternoon. The overnight forecast update was mostly focused on
the last few adjustments to the interior heat for Friday and
Saturday, as well as the marine winds.

A Heat Advisory will go in effect at 11 am for the North Bay
interior mountains, the East Bay hills and valleys, central and
eastern Santa Clara Country, as well as the interior Central Coast.
This Heat Advisory is set to expire 11 pm Saturday.

Coastal areas will stick to the 60s and 70s, the areas within the
Heat Adv will be pushing the upper 90s and into the triple-digits.
Some of these areas will only cool into the 60s and 70s overnight
meaning limited relief from the heat.

.LONG TERM...
(Saturday through Thursday)
Issued at 254 AM PDT Fri Jul 21 2023

While Friday continues to hold the title of the warmest day of the
forecast for the region overall, Saturday still looks hazardous.
Cooler marine air penetrates farther inland for, but the more
interior areas will see almost exactly the same highs as Friday.

Luckily, the pattern changes into Saturday night. Ridging turns to
zonal flow and then troughing for the second half of the weekend.
This will lead to a notably cooler night for interior areas followed
by a Sunday that is much closer to average for most areas. Monday
continues the cooling trend with mostly average highs and lows.

Monday`s temperatures will set the tone for the rest of the rest of
the work week as models put in little variation between daily highs
and lows.

Beyond that, the longer term models and ensembles are in fair
agreement that temperatures will continue to show only slight
variations after Monday`s cooldown through the end of the month.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 454 AM PDT Fri Jul 21 2023

Upper level ridging will continue compressing the marine layer
through the 12z TAF cycle, expect VLIFR-IFR in coastal stratus and
fog, inland VFR.

Vicinity of SFO...Near high confidence VFR through the period due
to a strengthening northerly ACV-SFO pressure gradient. Winds at
the terminal westerly near 10 knots this morning, increasing to 15
to 25 knots this afternoon and early evening.

SFO Bridge Approach...Slant range visibilities reduced especially
near sunrise and sunset since wildfire smoke and hazy conditions
continue to arrive in the Bay Area from southwest Oregon Flat Fire.

Monterey Bay Terminals...VLIFR-IFR in stratus and fog this morning,
including patchy dense morning fog, winds mainly onshore 5 to 10
knots. VLIFR-IFR conditions lifting to VFR by late this morning,
onshore winds 10 to 15 knots. IFR conditions redeveloping tonight
and Saturday morning due to stratus and fog.

.MARINE...
(Today through Wednesday)
Issued at 254 AM PDT Fri Jul 21 2023

Gusty northwesterly winds persist through the weekend. Gale force
gusts can be expected, especially over the northern outer waters
and coastal jet regions. Wind waves will create hazardous
conditions for small craft operators. Light southerly swell
persists through the week.
