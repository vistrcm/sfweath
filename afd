.SHORT TERM...
Issued at 126 AM PST Sun Feb 8 2026
(Today through Monday)

Mostly clear skies are being observed across the Bay Area and the
Central Coast this morning. As temperatures cool and reduce dew
point depressions, fog is starting to develop being patchy in
nature from the East Bay Valleys down the Salinas Valley and more
areas of fog development in the North Bay Valleys. Widespread
dense fog is not expected, but webcams will be monitored through
the morning.

After daybreak, the added sunshine will help mix out any
lingering fog my mid morning. Partly cloudy skies will remain out
ahead of the next system to the North, but mostly sunny skies are
expected for areas south of the Bay Bridge. Temperatures will
increase into the mid 60s for the Bay Area (upper 50s to low 60s
along the coastline) and a chance for low 70s in southern Monterey
County. No major changes to the forecast regarding the rain
chances today. The shortwave trough is still expected to pass over
southern Oregon keeping the higher precipitation totals there and
in the northern California. The (20 to 40 percent) chance for
area in the forecast area will mainly be in the North Bay with
only a couple hundredths or rain possible late this afternoon and
evening. Any chance for a sprinkle south of the North Bay is less
than 10 percent.

Cooler air will filter in behind this wave. Temperatures tomorrow
morning will be a degree or two cooler than this morning, with
another chance for patchy fog. Similarly, high temperatures will
also be slightly cooler on Monday than today, but still remain a
couple degrees warmer than seasonable norms. No precipitation is
expected to start the work week.

.LONG TERM...
Issued at 126 AM PST Sun Feb 8 2026
(Monday Night through Saturday)

The next upper level low will drop southward over the ocean and
move over the California Coast Tuesday afternoon through
Wednesday. Model runs are trending wetter with this system
compared to earlier in the weekend. With precipitable water
amounts trending just under an inch, there is a good chance that
coastal areas could see about or just over a half an inch of rain,
with some coastal higher elevations around an inch. While there
will still be a difference in amounts with coastal areas seeing
more, traditional rain shadowed areas could still even receive
over a quarter of an inch of rain. Lastly, models are suggesting a
potent 120+kt 300 mb jet will company this upper level low
providing some synoptic lift enhancement. However, the Euro is
suggesting the core of the jet would arrive over the Central Coast
whereas the GFS is slightly more north toward the Bay Area. While
CAPE values are not overly robust, model sounding are showing a
strip of shallow, skinny area of instability. While confidence is
not high, there is a slight chance for thunder Tuesday night.
While the details may still be tweaked, it looks like a widespread
soaking rain is in store for the Bay Area and the Central Coast
midweek.

Cooler air advection with this upper level low will help provide
more seasonable normal temperatures across the area by the middle
of the week. Weak ridging is expected Thursday in to Friday for a
brief respite from the rain.

Models are showing fairly good agreement in another system
expected to move in over the weekend. While models are disagreeing
on the specific timing and strength of the system, many ensemble
members are suggesting that this system has a higher chance for a
widespread soaking rain than the midweek system. And with colder
air filtering in aloft, snow levels are expected to drop below
5,000 feet. How low they will go and whether or not the peaks of
some of the higher terrain could see a dusting remains uncertain.
But morning low temperatures this weekend could drop down below 40
degrees for some of the interior valley locations.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 427 AM PST Sun Feb 8 2026

Areas of stratus and fog /LIFR-IFR/ mainly over the northern
coastal waters closely correspond to an area of surface to near
surface cooler air drifting into the Bay Area this morning. A
mainly clear sky is assisting with nocturnal radiative cooling to
saturation forming areas of stratus and fog over the coastal
waters and land. Recently light onshore winds have also helped to
transport stratus and fog to the coast and inland. Patchy stratus
and fog /LIFR-IFR/ over the north Central Coast has so far been
slow to develop, where it is currently outside the aforementioned
near surface cooler air at ~ 1000 mb level. Overall conditions
remain favorable for stratus and fog through daybreak until late
morning (and afternoon) when increasing diurnal surface warming
and mixing favors VFR.

For tonight and early Monday a cool front will move southeastward
over the coastal waters and bays resulting in an increase in
stratus ceilings /IFR-MVFR/. High resolution model output does
show some post frontal drying taking place later tonight and
Monday morning, though likely still leaving at least a mix of
patchy stratus and fog /IFR-MVFR/.

Vicinity of SFO...VFR prevails so far, with little in the way of
stratus seen on satellite imagery along the San Francisco Peninsula.
Conditions favor at least partial stratus formation through
daybreak, a tempo group for BKN IFR ceiling is forecast 13z-17z
today. Otherwise it`s VFR today into either early or mid evening,
currently advertising a return of stratus /MVFR/ ceiling 04z this
evening. West wind 5 to 10 knots.

SFO Bridge Approach...Stratus /IFR/ is occuring from KOAK southward
along the Bay Shoreline to KNUQ. Similar to SFO, conditions are
favorable for at least partial stratus formation closer to KSFO
and in the approach through daybreak. Otherwise it`s VFR today into
either early or mid evening, model output shows stratus /MVFR/
ceilings returning in advance of the incoming cool front arriving
tonight and early Monday.

Vicinity of SJC and OAK...Stratus /IFR/ is occuring from KOAK southward
along the Bay Shoreline to KNUQ and at times periodically forming to
the south at KSJC. Conditions are favorable for additional patches
of stratus and/or mist/fog. Otherwise it`s VFR today into either early
or mid evening, model output does show stratus /MVFR/ returning in
advance of the incoming cool front arriving tonight and early
Monday.

Monterey Bay Terminals...Ongoing nocturnal cooling will likely help
produce patches of stratus and fog /LIFR-IFR/ through daybreak.
There may be some advection of nearby newly forming stratus and
fog to the Monterey Bay Terminals as well through daybreak. Tempo
groups are in the 12z TAFs 13z-18z today, otherwise VFR from late
morning through the afternoon. Stratus /MVFR-IFR/ ceilings return
as early as 03z (or possibly earlier) in advance of the incoming
cool front tonight and early Monday. Light and variable winds
becoming onshore near 10 knots in the afternoon and light and
variable tonight and early Monday.

.MARINE...
(Today through Friday)
Issued at 326 AM PST Sun Feb 8 2026

A cold front currently 400 miles northwest of the Bay Area will
move southeastward over the coastal waters and bays tonight and
early Monday. Seas will continue moderate today. Northwest winds
will strengthen to a fresh to strong breeze today into Monday. A
low pressure system will then approach from the west bringing rain
to the coastal waters and bays Tuesday through Wednesday.

.MTR WATCHES/WARNINGS/ADVISORIES...

PZ...Small Craft Advisory from 3 PM this afternoon to 9 AM PST Monday
     for Pt Pinos to Pt Piedras Blancas 0-10 nm.

     Small Craft Advisory from 3 AM to 9 PM PST Monday for Pt Arena
     to Pt Reyes 10-60 NM.
