...New UPDATE, MARINE...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 1227 AM PDT Wed Aug 21 2024

Warm weather continues today, before a rare August cold front brings
gusty winds, cooler weather, and a chance for rain Friday into
Saturday.

&&

.UPDATE...
Issued at 901 AM PDT Wed Aug 21 2024

Low stratus has spread into the Petaluma Gap, through the Golden
Gate into the East Bay, across San Francisco, and extends locally
offshore adjacent to these areas. This afternoon is expected to be
slightly cooler than yesterday as onshore flow increases, but only
by a few degrees inland and coastal areas will be similar to
yesterday. Thus, the forecast remains on track this morning with no
updates anticipated to the current forecast.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 1227 AM PDT Wed Aug 21 2024

Satellite imagery reveals clear skies across the region. Model
output shows stratus developing at the immediate coast this morning,
with possibly a brief period of clouds in the inland regions, but
confidence is moderate at this point of the night. Low temperatures
will once again drop into the 50s to the low 60s for the lower
elevations, perhaps up to the mid 60s to lower 70s in the peaks of
the Santa Lucias.

A slight cooling starts today with an upper level low developing as
it descends from the Alaska Panhandle towards the area off the coast
of the Pacific Northwest through the day. Temperatures will remain
warm today, perhaps as many as 5 degrees cooler than yesterday`s
highs. Highs in the inland valleys reach the mid 80s to mid 90s,
while they hover in the upper 60s to the 70s along the Bayshore and
in the upper 50s to mid 60s along the Pacific coast. As has been the
case these last few days, breezy onshore winds will develop this
afternoon and evening with wind gusts up to 20 to 30 miles per hour
in the gaps, passes, and Salinas Valley. As the upper level low
approaches the region, winds during the evening hours might not
diminish as much as typical for this time of year. This is
especially true in the higher elevations of the East Bay, where a
stronger pressure gradient might result in gust speeds remaining the
same or slightly increasing as the night goes on.

&&

.LONG TERM...
(Wednesday night through next Monday)
Issued at 102 PM PDT Tue Aug 20 2024

By Thursday, the upper level trough will dig into the Pacific
Northwest and kick off a significant cooling trend through late week
and into Saturday (Friday being the coolest). There is high
confidence in this cooling trend as clusters are in good agreement
with the timing and position of the trough. As the front moves
trough the region Friday into Saturday, there is a 10-40% chance of
rain over the North Bay with chances trailing downward as you head
south of the Bay Area. However, rainfall is currently expected to
remain light, not amounting to anything more than a 0.10".

This pattern won`t last long as the trough responsible for the late
week cool down will shift eastward and be replaced by high pressure
over the Eastern Pacific. This will bring a warming trend back to
the region for the upcoming workweek.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 259 AM PDT Wed Aug 21 2024

Satellite continues to show largely clear conditions this morning,
though stratus is beginning to form off of the coast. Stratus will
likely bring MVFR CIGs briefly this morning to Monterey Bay and KOAK
terminals, with clearing to VFR expected towards the 16Z hour. W/NW
winds return this afternoon, with gusts nearing 20 knots for select
terminals, higher at KSFO. Models appear to be in good agreement
that coastal stratus will make a more aggressive push into area
terminals this evening, with the majority of terminals developing
MVFR CIGs in the overnight hours of Wednesday into Thursday.

Vicinity of SFO...VFR through the majority of the TAF period, though
low clouds may drift over the terminal early this morning. In the
afternoon, winds will increase out of the NW to become moderate, and
gusting generally in the 25-28kt range. Winds will slowly diminish
into the late night as coastal stratus begins to creep inland,
eventually forming MVFR CIGs over the terminal early Thursday.
Stratus expected to clear in the late morning Thursday to usher in a
return of VFR conditions.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...MVFR CIGs are thought to develop towards
the 13Z hour. However, confidence is only moderate given the lack of
stratus development thus far. Any stratus that does develop is not
likely to advect far inland, and will be quick to clear, with a
return to VFR expected towards the 16Z timeframe, perhaps even
earlier. Breezy winds return in the afternoon. A more aggressive
push of stratus is expected in the early evening to usher in MVFR
CIGs once more.

&&

.MARINE...
(Today through Monday)
Issued at 901 AM PDT Wed Aug 21 2024

Breezy northwest winds continue into the weekend with a slight
increase as trough brings chances for rain to the northern waters
Friday and into saturday. Winds ease behind this system into
Saturday.

.MTR WATCHES/WARNINGS/ADVISORIES...

PZ...Small Craft Advisory from 3 PM this afternoon to 9 PM PDT this
     evening for Mry Bay-Pigeon Pt to Pt Pinos 0-10 nm-Pigeon Pt

     Small Craft Advisory until 3 AM PDT Thursday for Pt Arena to Pt
