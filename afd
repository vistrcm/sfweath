...New AVIATION, MARINE...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 112 AM PDT Mon Aug 28 2023

Warm temperatures continue to build in the early part of the week,
peaking on Wednesday with inland highs in the mid 90s to lower 100s.
Dramatic cooldown on Friday, with temperatures below the seasonal
average through the upcoming weekend.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 112 AM PDT Mon Aug 28 2023

High temperatures continue to rise, especially inland, as an upper
level ridge builds into the state from the Desert Southwest. Lows
this morning remain in the mid to upper 50s for the lower
elevations, with lows rising into the 60s or possibly into the low
70s above the marine layer inversion. Today`s highs range from the
upper 60s to low 70s along the coast, to the mid to upper 70s near
the Bayshore, and into the 90s for the inland valleys, with the most
interior parts approaching or reaching 100. Breezy onshore winds
will develop through the afternoon and the evening, with wind gusts
generally up to 20 mph, perhaps up to 30 to 35 mph through the
passes and gaps.

.LONG TERM...
(Tuesday through Sunday)
Issued at 112 AM PDT Mon Aug 28 2023

The ridge continues to build through the middle of the week, with
high temperatures peaking on Wednesday, when highs range from the
upper 60s to the mid 70s along the coast, to the 80s along the
Bayshore, and the mid 90s to lower 100s across the inland valleys.
Low temperatures will rise slightly to the mid 50s to the lower 60s
across the lower elevations, and from the mid 60s to the low 70s at
the higher elevations. Breezy onshore winds continue, especially
along the coast, where wind gusts reach 25 mph during the
afternoon.

A trough axis along the West Coast develops into an upper level low
later on Wednesday, resulting in a rather rapid decrease in
temperatures through the end of the work week. After a slight
cooldown on Thursday, high temperatures will drop into the 60s along
the coast, the low to mid 70s along the Bayshore, and the low to mid
80s in the inland valleys. A very low confidence exists for showers
in this period, with the European and American ensemble models both
hinting at the possibility of rain as the upper level low migrates
south. As of now, probabilities remain low with the highest
probabilities around 10-20% in the higher elevations, so for now,
this is something to watch in the days ahead.
