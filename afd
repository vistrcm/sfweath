Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service San Francisco Bay Area
1103 PM PDT Wed May 10 2023

.SYNOPSIS...After a cool Wednesday, drying conditions and warmer
than seasonal normal begins Thursday. Isolated interior locations
with a probability of reaching 90 degrees. Minor cooling forecast
for early next week before temperatures warm back up.

&&

.DISCUSSION...as of 09:20 PM PDT Wednesday...Low clouds prevailed
across many coastal areas through much of the day allowing for
afternoon temperatures to be slightly cooler compared to
yesterday. By late afternoon, sky conditions cleared yet not in
time for much additional warming. Since then, low clouds are once
again redeveloping and will become more widespread through the
night and into Thursday. As mentioned below, the warm-up will
begin tomorrow as high pressure builds over the region. For
complete details, please see the previous discussion below.

.PREV DISCUSSION...as of 01:37 PM PDT Wednesday...

SHORT TERM...
(Rest of Wednesday through Thursday)

Temperatures on Wednesday across the Bay Area and the Central
Coast are running about three to five degrees below what they were
around noon on Tuesday. This is a result of the combined effort of
both cold air advection from persistent northwest flow as well as
a robust cloud layer that continues sit over much of the area,
shielding from of the sun`s rays. A few isolated low 70s are
possible for interior locations, but most of the coastline will
have highs in the upper 50s and interior areas with highs in the
60s as the clouds finally mix out. Winds will be light to breezy,
with stronger gusts featured through coastal gaps. Overnight lows
will once again be in the upper 40s and 50s as the cloud layer
rebuilt. There is a limited chance for patchy fog, but mainly
confined in the North Bay Valleys.

Thursday marks a transition day for the weather pattern. An upper
level ridge will slowly build allowing pressure to increase across
the Bay Area. The result of this is having temperatures gradually
increase. Widespread messaging is that temperatures will likely
still be below normal on Thursday.

LONG TERM...
(Friday through Tuesday)

The upper level ridge, whose axis is forecast to be SW to NE from
the Eastern Pacific toward Calgary, will strengthen Friday and
Saturday. The heat will certainly be on, where the strength of the
500 mb high will be near 3 sigma anomalously above normal over
the province of Alberta Canada. Being farther away from the
center, the higher pressure over California will be anomalously
above normal, but less so. This all translates into a forecast
where temperatures will climb Friday and Saturday, not a record
breaking heat wave is forecast, but temperature values will still
be around 10 to potentially 15 degrees above normal. Temperatures
for the interior areas will warm into the upper 70s and 80s on
Friday and warmer on Saturday with isolated 90 degree temperatures
for the farthest interior locations. Confidence is high for this
forecast, so for people that are particularly sensitive to the
heat, now is the time to prepare. Make sure to have a method of
staying cool, indoors if possible or at least in the shade, wear
loose fitting clothing, and drink plenty of water. The ocean may
be an idea for someone to escape the heat, but remember that it
can be a dangerous place, and to never turn your back to the
ocean.

With the warmer temperatures, the higher pressure driving the
warmth will also help erode and essentially evaporate the marine
layer. This will usher in drier conditions, particularly for
interior higher elevations with some locations dropping into the
low twenty to thirty percent range. The positive side of things is
that because of the winter rains, fuels are still plenty moist
which translate into there being no fire danger from a weather
perspective. However, finer fuels like grass are tall and this is
a good reminder to not be that spark. Early next week will be an
interesting look to see how area fuels respond to this heat event.

Sunday and Monday will see lower 500 mb heights translate East to
West and merge with the stationary low out over the Eastern
Pacific. The outer edges of the low will extend over California as
an inverted trough suppressing the impact from the ridge, causing
it to lift northward. Temperatures will cool slightly, but remain
around seasonal norms. Ensemble models are suggesting that the low
will weaken, though remaining stationary, allowing the ridge to
reform and have temperatures return to slightly above normal the
middle of next week. There is still uncertainty on how and where
the ridge next week develops, as cluster analysis is showing a lot
of variation in the models; however, the consistently gives
confidence that the region is in for warmer and drier conditions
for the extended.

.AVIATION...as of 10:58 PM Wednesday...For the 06Z TAFs. MVFR CIGs
build into the night with areas of IFR and LIFR CIGs forming into
early Thursday. Winds reduce into the night becoming light to
moderate. Cloud cover thins into the mid to late morning on
Thursday, followed by an afternoon with moderate westerly winds.

Vicinity of SFO...MVFR and moderate winds wast into the late
morning. VFR returns Thursday afternoon with moderate westerly winds.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.


Monterey Bay Terminals...MVFR through the late light, tuning to IFR
for the early morning. Expect light and variable winds overnight
with moderate winds and clearing skies expected Thursday afternoon.


&&

.MARINE...as of 11:02 PM PDT Wednesday...Strong northwest winds
continue Thursday along the coastline  particularly north of
Bodega Bay as well as south of Pigeon Point  and down the Big Sur
coast that can generate hazardous seas. Winds are forecast to
increase to near gale force strength Friday  afternoon along
coastlines. Mixed seas will prevail as a new  southerly swell
arrives Thursday morning.
