...New SYNOPSIS, SHORT TERM, LONG TERM...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 200 AM PST Sat Jan 27 2024

Continued dry and mild weather into the weekend. Near record warm
temps Sunday/Monday. Next storm system still on track for midweek
with widespread rainfall, lingering moisture through next weekend.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 200 AM PST Sat Jan 27 2024

Pleasant day today with not much to talk about for the weekend.
Light showers dropping a couple hundredths of an inch up in the
North Bay overnight last night, with some lingering this morning.
Don`t expect much more than just enough to hit the windshield
wipers a few times. All of the action is in the long term, so
let`s jump right in.

.LONG TERM...
(Sunday through Friday)
Issued at 200 AM PST Sat Jan 27 2024

A few record highs appear likely Sunday and Monday as the ridge
over the western US dominates the flow pattern. Many locations are
likely to see temps 10-15 degrees above seasonal normals with
highs in the upper 60s to mid-70s. Locations along the Salinas
Valley look to be the warmest, with a slight chance (~10%) of
reaching 80 degrees.

By Tuesday, the strong ridge begins to migrate eastward, and a
deep trough associated with a strong storm system in the Gulf of
Alaska begins to nudge towards our area. Driven by a robust 150+
knot extension of the Pacific jet, this trough is progged to dig
into the West Coast and further into the SW US by Thursday.
Ensemble guidance is beginning to come to a better agreement in
this scenario in which a surface trough extending from a deep
parent surface low near British Columbia will move through the Bay
Area and Central Coast on Wednesday. At this point, it appears
likely that we will indeed see periods of moderate-to-heavy
rainfall with this frontal passage on Wednesday, but any
potential for a stalling system is slim at this point.

A bit of a side note on what we Meteorologists think of when we
hear "Atmospheric River"; it`s something more like what is
currently going on in British Columbia, where heavy precip
associated with numerous perturbations around a nearly stationary
upper low "pump" moisture into a region for an extended period of
time. Yes, the storm we are getting is technically a part of that
system, but what effectively cuts a chunk off and brings it down
to us is that 150+ knot jet just upstream of the trough. As long
as that thing is driving, our storm is on a non-stop journey.
That`s certainly not to say this storm won`t be impactful. More
on that below.

Without diving too much into how much total rain we will see out
of this, it may be better to look at the exceedance probabilities
during the time period when the heaviest rainfall is expected.
The highest widespread rainfall rates are currently progged to
occur beginning Wednesday morning for the North Bay, spreading
southward through the day. At this time there is moderate-to-high
confidence (70-80%) that higher elevations of the North Bay and
other coastal ranges will see at least 2" in 24 hours, and
moderate confidence (50-65%) that the Sonoma coast range, Santa
Cruz Mtns, and Big Sur coast see at least 3" in 24 hours.
Additional rainfall is expected as moisture lingers into the
weekend, but the period from Wednesday morning to Thursday morning
appears the most impactful at the moment. In terms of impacts,
soils are near saturation and well primed from the previous storm
cycle. Any heavy rainfall will have no problem running off into
creeks, streams, and roadways. The good news is that our main stem
rivers are doing well and can accept quite a bit of runoff before
becoming problematic. At this point, there is a low chance (~10%)
of any main stem river going into flood stage. However, given
antecedent conditions contributing to quick runoff, careful
monitoring will be required. The most likely impacts look to be
stream and urban flooding, shallow landslides along steep slopes,
and sporadic tree damage due to high winds with the frontal
passage.

Details will continue to emerge over the next few days. We still
DO NOT see any indication of devastating flooding associated with
next week`s storm. Stay tuned to the forecast for the latest!

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 330 AM PST Sat Jan 27 2024

Patchy fog near STS is expected to persist through the morning, with
a stray shower possible at the terminal and points north through the
day. Low confidence (20-30% probability) of MVFR visibilities at the
three main SF Bay Area terminals after midnight, with higher
confidence (50-60% probability) at STS with fog possible. Otherwise,
generally VFR with high clouds and light winds.

Vicinity of SFO... Model output is showing some probability (20-30%)
for MVFR visibilities developing after midnight into Sunday morning.
Otherwise, generally VFR with high clouds and light winds.

SFO Bridge Approach... Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals... Breezy drainage flows expected in the
morning hours, especially at SNS. Otherwise, generally VFR with high
clouds and light winds.

.MARINE...
(Today through Thursday)
Issued at 330 AM PST Sat Jan 27 2024

Gentle to moderate southerly winds over the northern waters
persist as northerly winds remain light to gentle across the
southern waters through the weekend into the work week. Periodic
light rain will continue over the northern waters into the
weekend. Multiple moderate period westerly swell trains will
propagate through the waters through the upcoming week. Stronger
winds and showers over the waters are possible next week with the
upcoming frontal system.
