.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 303 AM PDT Sun Oct 29 2023

Red Flag Warning continues for much of the Bay Area and the Santa
Lucias until 5 PM today, as gusty offshore winds and very dry air
create critical fire weather conditions. Winds diminish later today,
with the next chance for rain later in the week.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 303 AM PDT Sun Oct 29 2023

Key Messages:
* Critical fire weather concerns continue today
* Dry and windy conditions persisting through the afternoon
* Most critical period is now through the rest of the morning
* Red Flag warnings for much of the Bay Area and Santa Lucia
  Mountains through 5 PM
* Wind Advisory for Bay Area higher elevations through 5 PM
* Freeze Warning for S Salinas Valley until 8 AM
* Be One Less Spark - conditions are conducive to rapid fire spread

Satellite imagery continue to show clear skies through the region,
as offshore flow aloft and at the higher elevations continues. Very
high wind gusts and dry conditions are being reported at the
ridgetops; as of the time of writing, gusts at Mt St Helena were 60
mph, at Mt Diablo, 57 mph, and at Mt Umunhum, 39 mph. Relative
humidities at those sites were 21%, 24%, and 25% respectively. So
far, only hints of those high wind gusts have made it down to the
valley floors. Sonoma County Airport briefly reported wind gusts up
to 23 mph, although those have since calmed down, while Napa and
Livermore Airports have instead seen sustained northerly winds to 12
mph. One possible reason is that the offshore pressure gradient (SFO-
WMC) is currently at -12 mb, which is still impressive, but is
running behind last night`s expected forecast. However, model output
also shows the pressure gradient continuing to strengthen through
the course of the early morning, with the HRRR and GFS going so far
to suggest a gradient of -14 mb during the morning.

Water vapor imagery shows mountain wave imagery across the North and
East Bays, with some indications in high-resolution model output of
strong winds in the leeward side of the North and East Bay
mountains. As a result, while confidence has decreased slightly in
terms of strong winds in the North Bay and East Bay valleys, they
can not be ruled out. Will have to monitor closely throughout the
morning for any potential impacts to the valley floors, but for now
will hold off on a Wind Advisory for those areas, although valley
winds will continue to be breezy and gusty through the day, barring
the interior Monterey and San Benito counties where winds will be
much lighter.

As for humidities, maximum humidity values have already been set
across the region, and relative humidity values are expected to
continue decreasing through the morning. The combination of clear
skies and low humidity will allow cold temperatures to develop
across the calm regions of Monterey and San Benito Counties, where a
Freeze Warning is in effect for the southern Salinas Valley until 8
AM today. A few places in the extreme southern and southeastern
portions of Monterey County could see lows near or just below
freezing. In windier locations, cold temperatures should not be a
concern, and where the winds have picked up speed, the trend has
been for nighttime temperatures to increase during the times when
winds become gustier. Lows tonight will be in the low to mid 40s for
the interior SF Bay Area and Monterey Bay coast, with the Bayshore
and the Pacific coast seeing lows into the upper 40s to low 50s.

Critical fire weather conditions continue through the morning and
the Red Flag Warning expires for much of the Bay Area and Santa
Lucia Mountains at 5 PM. To repeat what my colleague said earlier;
You`ve heard it a million times, but we`ll say it again: Remember to
"Don`t be the spark," and avoid driving vehicles or operating
machinery or power tools over dry grass, as sparks could ignite
fires. In addition, given that it is the Halloween weekend and many
folks may be having parties with campfires or fire pits: be careful
if you are having one, and make sure that fires are in an enclosed
ring or pit, and have a water bucket or hose at the ready. Better
yet, if you can hold off and refrain from having a fire of any sort
this weekend, all the safer!

Winds will slowly begin to diminish this afternoon, remaining breezy
into the evening, before calmer conditions return Monday morning.
Highs today will be in the low to mid 70s for the inland valleys,
the low 70s for the Bayshore, and the mid to upper 60s along the
coast and in the higher elevations, with the ridgelines seeing highs
in the low 60s.

.LONG TERM...
(Monday through Saturday)
Issued at 1257 AM PDT Sun Oct 29 2023

Monday through Wednesday:

A shortwave ridge aloft will take hold across the West Coast early
next week with lighter offshore winds prevailing as the surface
pressure gradient relaxes. A daytime warming trend will also prevail
with inland highs reaching the mid to upper 70s, which is a good 5
to 10 degrees above the seasonal averages. With good radiational
cooling overnight temperatures will still feel a bit chilly with
lows dropping mostly into the 40s. Some of the colder interior areas
of the Central Coast will likely reach the 30s with a few spots
nearing freezing in far southern Monterey County.

Thursday through Saturday:

Quasi-zonal flow evolves aloft with an embedded shortwave
progressing through NorCal and the Pacific Northwest on Thursday
into Friday. Some very light precipitation may accompany this system
in portions of the North Bay, but model trends have been drying and
confidence in this is low. Otherwise look for a return to onshore
flow, better humidity recoveries, and likely a bit more coastal
clouds. Another system approaches the same general area late Friday
into Saturday, but once again the best moisture plume appears to be
focused north of our area. This brings a downward trend in projected
rain amounts with less confidence in wetting rainfall for all but
perhaps the Sonoma coastal range. Temperatures will moderate with
highs dropping by a few degrees as overnight lows climb into the 40s
and 50s.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 425 AM PDT Sun Oct 29 2023

VFR through the TAF period. Wind gusts at the terminals have not
been as strong as previously forecast, but with the SFO-WMC gradient
continuing to strengthen, will need to monitor observations for the
rest of the morning. For now, have kept breezy offshore flow across
the terminals through the morning, with LLWS across the North and
East Bay, with the wind gusts at LVK converted into an LLWS
forecast. Winds will start to diminish early this afternoon and will
become light in the evening.

Vicinity of SFO... VFR through the TAF period. Winds have finally
shifted to the northeast, albeit the speeds are less intense than
forecast. Will keep morning wind speeds as they are for now,
especially given the possibility for some stronger gusts to mix down
as the morning progresses. Winds will start diminishing in the
afternoon and become light in the evening hours through the end of
the TAF period.

SFO Bridge Approach... Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals... VFR through the TAF period. Breezy valley
drainage winds through the morning, shifting to the northwest again
this afternoon before diminishing again this evening.

.MARINE...
(Today through Friday)
Issued at 425 AM PDT Sun Oct 29 2023

Winds will veer increasingly offshore across the coastal waters
today. Locally gusty northeasterly winds possible through Sunday
near coastal gaps near Half Moon Bay and through the Golden Gate.
Light, moderate period westerly swell and long period, light
southerly swell continue into early next week. Light winds
expected next week.

.FIRE WEATHER...
Issued at 1030 AM PDT Sat Oct 28 2023

Forecast remains on track as the first set of Red Flag Warnings go
into effect - elevations above 1,000 feet. The change from
yesterday was to include the Santa Lucia Mt Zone (CA517). A
classic nocturnal drying event took place over the Santa Lucia
Range this morning with RH recoveries peaking at 3-4 AM near 100%
RH and then crashing to 4% RH 7-8 AM. The Chews Ridge obs also
noted some decent wind at 5k feet too with gusts 20-30 mph. In
other words, over the higher elevations critical fire weather
conditions developed this morning for the Santa Lucia Range. Do
expected the RH values to actually "recover" this afternoon before
staying critically low again tonight. While winds won`t be as
strong as other portions of the district they`ll still breezy
nonetheless. When looking at ERC charts for the Central Coast keep
in mind they`re likely skewed due to rains that fell from Hillary
over the eastern portion of that PSA and not over the Santa Lucia
Range. Therefore, critical fire weather conditions will be
possible over CA517 through at least Sunday afternoon/evening.
Even though winds diminish Sunday evening, the critically low RH
lingers Sunday night and Monday night over the higher elevations.

Elsewhere in the district, no notable changes to ongoing
forecast. Red Flag Warnings go into effect later this
afternoon/evening as the offshore flow event really kicks in
allowing for better downward momentum transfer with lower
elevations experiencing critical fire weather conditions.
