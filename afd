...New UPDATE...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 111 AM PDT Sat Oct 19 2024

Red Flag conditions continue today due to an inside slider weather
pattern.

&&

.UPDATE...
Issued at 907 AM PDT Sat Oct 19 2024

Forecast remains on track this morning with focus on fire weather
concerns. Winds have eased somewhat from yesterday, but a very dry
airmass remains in place with current RH values in the teens to
low 20 percent range. There were numerous small fires yesterday
afternoon that have been contained, but the risk for additional
ignitions continues today. Any fire that does start has the
potential to spread rapidly with the breezy winds and near record
fuel values. Avoid any activities that could spark a wildfire
today.

&&

.SHORT TERM...
(Today) Issued at 111 AM PDT Sat Oct 19 2024

Red Flag conditions will continue through the day as the pressure
gradient between high pressure in the Great Basin and low pressure
in the Desert Southwest continues to support offshore flow. While
winds are forecast to decrease through the day, they will
continue to prevail out of the northeast, promoting compressional
warming and rapid drying. Do not let lower wind speeds fool you
into thinking that the fire weather threat is over, wind speed is
only one factor. Relative humidity is another factor and it will
continue to be poor. There were at least six new fire starts
across the Bay Area and Central Coast Friday. Every effort should
be made to prevent a wildfire spark always, but especially
today.

&&

.LONG TERM...
(Tonight through Friday) Issued at 111 AM PDT Sat Oct 19 2024

The offshore pressure gradient will weaken and reverse tonight as
the cutoff low responsible for the inside slider exits to the
northeast. Building surface high pressure across the west will
result in a gradual warmup to 10-20 degrees above normal by
Wednesday. A surface low pressure system and an associated cold
front will trek into the Pacific Northwest Thursday. This will bring
renewed chances of beneficial rainfall of up to 40% to the Bay
Area, but as is normal for this time of year, probability of
precipitation decreases from north to south.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 429 AM PDT Sat Oct 19 2024

VFR through the TAF period with LLWS across the SF Bay Area through
the next couple of hours, as light surface winds give way to
widespread northeasterly flow aloft, with speeds up to 30-40 knots.
Along the Central Coast, confidence in LLWS is lower as flow aloft
is somewhat weaker. LLWS concerns diminish through the morning hours
with light offshore flow through the late morning, followed by
onshore winds developing in the afternoon. Light offshore flow
retuens this evening and through the night.

Vicinity of SFO... VFR through the TAF period. LLWS continues
through the early morning hours with northeast winds aloft around 25-
35 knots, with surface winds remaining light from the west-
northwest. LLWS diminishes by 15Z with breezy onshore winds this
afternoon and evening, diminishing overnight.

SFO Bridge Approach... Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals... VFR through the TAF period. Light offshore
flow continues through the morning hours with onshore winds
developing this afternoon and evening before light offshore flow
returns overnight.

&&

.MARINE...
(Today through Thursday)
Issued at 407 AM PDT Sat Oct 19 2024

Expect gusty northwest winds to linger this morning over the
waters with some gale-force gusts in the northern outer waters.
Winds will diminish into the afternoon and evening with wave
heights abating to 5-7 ft by Sunday. Similar conditions are
expected to persist through the week.

&&

.FIRE WEATHER...
Issued at 407 AM PDT Sat Oct 19 2024

Red Flag conditions continue to be observed across the region this
morning with multiple weather stations recording relative
humidity as low as 11% and wind gusts as high as 35-50 mph, Mt.
St. Helena recorded the strongest gust at 76 mph. While
northeasterly winds will decrease through the day, poor daytime
relative humidity will still support elevated fire weather
conditions. A Red Flag Warning is in effect through 5 PM Saturday
for the Bay Area and Central Coast with the exception of coastal
Marin, Monterey, and Sonoma Counties. Sustained northeasterly
winds largely on the order of 25-35 mph can be expected with gusts
to 50 mph, and isolated gusts to 65 mph across the highest
terrain and ridgetops and through gaps and passes. Every
precaution should be taken to prevent a wildfire spark always,
but especially today.

&&

.MTR WATCHES/WARNINGS/ADVISORIES...
CA...Red Flag Warning until 5 PM PDT this afternoon for CAZ006-
     502>504-506-508>510-512>518-528-529.
