.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 143 AM PST Sun Jan 28 2024

Near record warm today and tomorrow with temps well above average.
Impactful storm system still on track for Wednesday with
widespread moderate-to-heavy rainfall.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and Monday)
Issued at 143 AM PST Sun Jan 28 2024

Broad ridge over the Western US with near record high temps across
the area today and tomorrow. Cloudy conditions may inhibit daytime
highs a bit, but it will still be unseasonably warm, nonetheless.
Expect temps in the upper 60s to mid-70s across the board while
portions of the Salinas Valley have about a 10% chance of seeing
80 degrees.

.LONG TERM...
(Tuesday through Saturday)
Issued at 143 AM PST Sun Jan 28 2024

The forecast remains on track for a deep upper low to move into
our area beginning late Tuesday as a robust Pacific jet digs the
trough to the SE while the downstream ridge over the US vacates
to the NE. Ensemble guidance continues to show agreement in this
scenario in which a surface trough extending from a deep parent
surface low near British Columbia will move through the Bay Area
and Central Coast on Wednesday. At this point, it is a high
confidence forecast that we will see periods of moderate-to-
heavy rainfall with this frontal passage on Wednesday, but any
potential for a stalling system is still slim at this point.
After the main frontal passage, we do remain in a wet and active
pattern into the weekend where we will see rounds of lighter
scattered showers.

Since we are expecting the most impactful rain to fall during a 24
hour period with the initial frontal passage, it may be better to
look at the exceedance probabilities during that time period
rather than putting too much focus on the total rainfall
throughout the week. The highest rainfall rates are currently
progged to occur beginning Wednesday morning for the North Bay,
spreading southward through the day. At this time there is
very high confidence (95%) that higher elevations of the North
Bay and other coastal ranges will see at least 2" in 24 hours, and
high confidence (70-90%) that the Sonoma coast range, Santa Cruz
Mtns, and Big Sur coast see at least 3" in 24 hours. For lower
elevation and urban areas, at least an inch in 24 hours appears
likely outside of the typical rainshadowed Santa Clara and Salinas
valleys, while at least 2" in 24 hours is likely for the North Bay
valleys and Santa Cruz proper. Additional rainfall is expected as
moisture lingers into the weekend, but the period from Wednesday
morning to Thursday morning appears the most impactful at the
moment. For the total period from Wednesday through Friday,
coastal ranges are likely to pick up 4-5", 2-4" elsewhere in the
North Bay, up to 2" for the city of SF, the East Bay, and other
lower elevation population centers, and around 1-1.5" for the
Santa Clara and Salinas Valleys.

In terms of impacts, soils are near saturation and well primed
from the previous storm cycle. Any heavy rainfall will have no
problem running off into creeks, streams, and roadways. The good
news is that our main stem rivers are doing well and can accept
quite a bit of runoff before becoming problematic. A notable
change with this update is the increase in the chance that main
stem rivers rise above flood stage. There is now about a 10-30%
chance of main stem rivers reaching minor flood stage Thursday and
Friday, with the higher end of those probabilities being for the
North Bay rivers. Otherwise, the most likely impacts look to be
stream and urban flooding, numerous shallow landslides along steep
slopes. Winds will also likely be an issue with the main frontal
passage Wednesday with high confidence in gusts over 40 mph along
exposed coastal locations and ridgetops. There is a slight chance
in isolated gusts to 50 mph along the Big Sur coast and ridge of
the Santa Cruz Mtns. Generally 30-40 mph gusts elsewhere. It is
likely that we will be dealing with sporadic downed trees and
powerlines as well.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 324 AM PST Sun Jan 28 2024

Some fog possible at STS later this morning, depending on the
strength of offshore flow from the Mayacamas that so far have kept
dew point depressions just high enough to prevent widespread fog
formation. Strong drainage flow is also being reported at APC,
and is expected to persist through the morning. Confidence in SJC
seeing MVFR visibilities later this morning has decreased
somewhat, but decided to hold off on pushing the terminal to VFR
for the TAF period. Otherwise generally VFR with high clouds and
light winds through the end of the TAF period.

Vicinity of SFO... Low confidence (up to 20-30% probability) for
some stratus and mist to develop over the SF Bay early Monday
morning. Otherwise, generally VFR with high clouds and light
winds.

SFO Bridge Approach... Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals... Breezy drainage flows expected through the
morning hours, especially at SNS. Otherwise, generally VFR with high
clouds and light winds.

.MARINE...
(Today through Friday)
Issued at 324 AM PST Sun Jan 28 2024

Light to gentle winds continue into the weekend before shifting
southerly and building early next week ahead of the next weather
system, which will bring widespread rain across the coastal waters
midweek. Light moderate period westerly swells will persist
through the early portion of next week. By midweek next week, a
larger westerly swell will build across the waters, posing a
hazard to small craft vessels.
