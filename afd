...New AVIATION...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 239 AM PST Thu Jan 25 2024

Drying conditions return Thursday and continue throughout the
upcoming weekend, aside from a slight chance of rainfall across the
North Bay through late week. Above normal temperatures late this
weekend into early next week.

&&

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 239 AM PST Thu Jan 25 2024

Drier conditions develop today with temperatures struggling to reach
the upper 50s to lower 60s (cooler in the region`s peaks) in wake of
yesterday`s frontal passage. Tonight, expect temperatures to cool
into the mid/upper 40s across much of the Bay Area and into the mid
30s across the interior portions of the Central Coast.

&&

.LONG TERM...
(Friday through Wednesday)
Issued at 239 AM PST Thu Jan 25 2024

Light rain will be possible over the far northern portions of the
North Bay on Friday and Saturday, but rainfall is expected to be
0.10" or less during this timeframe.

A gradual warming trend will kick off Friday and continue into the
upcoming weekend. A more robust warm up is expected by Sunday and
will continue through about Tuesday as a ridge of high pressure
builds over the region. By Sunday, most interior areas will warm
into the low/mid 70s. It`s possible a few records may be tied
and/or broken during this time period.

Forecast ensembles continue to paint a wet picture by mid-to-late
next week. However, the specifics with regards to the impacts and
rainfall amounts remain difficult to nail down at this time.
Regardless, the region can expect another round of rain to move
through the region by the middle of next week. Lots of uncertainty
remains, which will be fine tuned in the coming days.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 325 AM PST Thu Jan 25 2024

VFR-MVFR skies with patchy fog across the interior valleys.
Confidence in clearing times for stratus is low but expect generally
VFR conditions and light winds by the afternoon. A frontal system
grazes the region overnight into Friday morning, but not expecting
any ceilings below MVFR at worst, and any associated rain should be
limited to the North Bay and comes just after the end of the 24-hour
TAF period.

Vicinity of SFO... MVFR ceilings will clear by the afternoon, with
light winds through the TAF period, onshore during the day turning
offshore overnight. Not expecting any rain nor any sub-VFR
ceilings from the frontal system tonight and Friday morning.

SFO Bridge Approach... Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals... MVFR conditions continue through the
morning. Light onshore winds develop in the afternoon, turning
offshore overnight.

Clear skies and light northwest breezes prevail today, with some
breezy winds in the coastal jet regions. Possible light rain will
return over the northern outer waters Friday into the weekend. A
westerly swell will come through the waters today and create
hazards for small craft in the outer waters through the evening
hours.
