...New UPDATE, MARINE...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 142 AM PDT Thu Oct 24 2024

Dry airmass and elevated fire weather concerns continue today.
Conditions improve Friday as an upper low approaches and moisture
increases. Rain chances late this weekend. Extended period remains
active.

&&

.UPDATE...
Issued at 859 AM PDT Thu Oct 24 2024

Mostly clear skies continue this morning with generally light
offshore flow. The fire weather snooper showed some winds at
higher elevation are overperforming the forecast, with several
stations gusting into the mid-20s throughout the Bay Area. To
account for this discrepancy, I analyzed the current observations
against various high-resolution guidance. The most appropriate
blend came out to the max of HRRR and WRF, and that was carried
out through the next 24 hours when the winds should diminish. With
offshore winds and low humidity, the result is another day of
moderate fire danger in the North Bay mountains, Diablo Range and
Santa Cruz mountains. This change didn`t have much of an effect of
the low-lands, where it will still be a very nice day.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 142 AM PDT Thu Oct 24 2024

Light offshore winds underway this morning with the highest gusts
mostly confined above 1500 feet. As of writing, Mt. Diablo and Mt.
St. Helena are the two winners with gusts in the mid-30s mph. RH
across the region has thankfully not reached critical levels,
whereas most locations that are experiencing offshore winds are in
the 20-30% range. SFO-WMC gradient sitting around -5.5 mb
(negative = offshore-oriented), and is forecast to bottom out
right around this issuance...gradually increasing (decreasing
offshore wind potential) through today. Even though the winds are
expected to decrease and become more onshore tonight, conditions
will still be relatively dry, as the best RH improvements don`t
arrive until the weekend.

.LONG TERM...
(Friday through Wednesday)
Issued at 142 AM PDT Thu Oct 24 2024

If you`ve been following along with the "uncertainty saga" from
the previous couple of days, I have better news for you this
morning. Keep reading to find out! Conditions Friday and Saturday
appear fairly quiet and represent a transition state as a deep
upper low moves out of the Gulf of Alaska. There is a cut off low
several hundred miles offshore that will linger and eventually get
caught up in this deeper Gulf of Alaska low. However, as it passes
through in the form of a transient shortwave trough late Friday,
we will see the marine layer start to deepen and humidity start
to climb. Not too much other sensible weather out of this initial
shortwave aside from maybe some high clouds. The real story comes
in by Sunday when the deep upper low approaches the PNW and digs
southward at the mercy of a 120 kt meridional jet upstream from
the base of the trough. This is where the "uncertainty saga" takes
a turn. Ensemble guidance is finally converging on a solution with
reasonable confidence to start talking about specifics. The ECMWF
ensemble system has started coming in wetter (trending more in
line with the GFS ensemble system), and cluster analysis
advertises moderate-to-high confidence in the track and position
of the upper low Sunday into Monday. What does this mean for
sensible weather? Rain! No, not for everyone. Calm down, San Jose.
The north-south cut off for measurable rainfall in the current
forecast is right around the SF Bay, and the Santa Cruz mountains
will likely see some light amounts as well due to the additional
help from orographic forcing. Points south of the bay will likely
struggle to see much, while points north could see a tenth of an
inch or two. The highest amounts are forecasted in the North Bay
counties, ranging from 0.10" to around 0.50" by Sunday night...higher
amounts as you go north and along coastal ranges. Beyond Sunday
and into the middle of the week, this is where uncertainty takes
another stand. Confidence is high that we will remain in an active
pattern through at least the 1st of the month, but rain chances
with the evolution of this system and the trajectory of future
systems remain up in the air. Nothing stark to point at for now
beyond Sunday/Monday, but there is a small chance we could pick up
some additional rainfall through midweek.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 411 AM PDT Thu Oct 24 2024

VFR through the TAF period across the region. Light offshore flow
continues through the morning, followed by light to breezy onshore
winds in the afternoon and evening. Light winds, possibly offshore,
return overnight.

Vicinity of SFO... VFR through the TAF period. Light offshore winds
this morning with breezy onshore flow resuming during the afternoon
and evening.

SFO Bridge Approach... Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals... VFR through the TAF period. Light offshore
flow through the morning with breezy northwest flow expected in the
afternoon and evening hours.

&&

.MARINE...
(Today through Tuesday)
Issued at 859 AM PDT Thu Oct 24 2024

Expect breezy north and northwest winds to linger into the weekend
and increase in the late weekend. Significant wave  heights in the
outer waters become moderate today through Friday  morning with a
gradual building trend beginning Friday afternoon  with
significant wave heights of 10-12 feet expected in the outer
waters Monday.

&&

.FIRE WEATHER...
Issued at 334 PM PDT Wed Oct 23 2024

Near critical fire weather conditions will exist over portions of
the Bay Area and Central Coast through at least Thursday due to
breezy offshore flow and lower humidity. Surface high pressure is
on track to build over E OR/N NV/S ID tonight with low pressure
remaining along the CA coast. This orientation will allow for
offshore flow to develop. Model guidance initially downplayed the
potential for offshore, but yesterday and today guidance suggest
offshore from SFO-WMC gradient to be -9 to -11 mb. Not a big
gradient, but impactful nonetheless. Local WRF model captures the
offshore flow late tonight and early Thursday with NE winds 10-20
mph with gusts 30 mph (locally 40+mph Mt St Helena). Marginal
humidity recovery 1,000 feet as well with recovery early in the
night then drying late as peak offshore flow kicks in. Offshore
gradient eases Thursday day, but low humidity remains. Regions for
most critical conditions will be North Bay Mts and East Bay
Hills.

North Ops GACC also has highlighted the Diablo/Santa Cruz zone
for very dry conditions through Thursday as well.
