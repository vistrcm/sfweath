Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service San Francisco CA
442 AM PDT Tue Aug 13 2024

...New SYNOPSIS, SHORT TERM, LONG TERM, AVIATION, MARINE...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 420 AM PDT Tue Aug 13 2024

Temperatures at or just below normal continue through this week,
as well as breezy onshore flow and a fairly pleasant pattern.

&&

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 420 AM PDT Tue Aug 13 2024

Mostly clear skies across the area this morning in the wake of
progressive upper level trough. High temperatures today will
generally be a few degrees warmer than yesterday, particularly in
the interface between `marine` and `inland` areas, such as the Bay
shoreline and the areas within a few miles of the coast.
Otherwise, coastal and further inland temps remain about the same.
Patchy stratus looks to return again tonight, but will be limited
due to another weak, progressive upper-level trough approaching.

&&

.LONG TERM...
(Wednesday through Monday)
Issued at 420 AM PDT Tue Aug 13 2024

The pattern through the rest of the forecast period generally
depicts a pattern that would favor these progressive troughs, thus
keeping temps moderated right around or even below seasonal
normals. Temperatures are expected to slide a few degrees lower
through the middle of the week, but no real sensible change in
store. The main weather story at the moment would be the gusty
onshore winds that develop each afternoon during peak heating.
These winds won`t be widespread, but mostly limited to coastal
areas, and locations near gaps, passes, and NW-SE oriented
valleys. Not expected to be a major fire weather threat thanks to
good moisture supply and the winds diminishing each night, but
still a factor to keep in mind as we near the climatological peak
of dry fuels over the next couple of months.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 420 AM PDT Tue Aug 13 2024

Satellite continues to show clear skies for most terminals this
morning. Expect terminals that are currently clear to remain VFR
through the remainder of the TAF period, whereas Monterey Bay
terminals and KOAK currently seeing CIGs from stratus are likely to
clear to VFR near the 16Z hour. Breezy onshore winds, generally W/NW
but for the North Bay terminals are expected this afternoon. Winds
ease into the nighttime to become light. Stratus returns late for
Monterey Bay and KOAK, bringing MVFR CIGs.

Vicinity of SFO...VFR through the TAF period. Winds increase out of
the W/NW this afternoon to become moderate, with a few gusts
reaching into the 20 knot range. Winds then diminish into the
nighttime.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...CIGs will likely continue to oscillate
between MVFR/IFR this morning as they hover near the 1000` mark.
However, towards 16Z if not sooner, clearing to VFR is expected.
Winds increase to become breezy in the afternoon. Low confidence on
whether stratus will make a return Wednesday morning, though
thoughts are that if any CIG is to form, it will likely be within
MVFR territory.

&&

.MARINE...
(Today through Sunday)
Issued at 420 AM PDT Tue Aug 13 2024

Northwesterly winds continue through the week. Winds will be
predominantly fresh, though some gusts may reach to become strong.
Moderate northwesterly swell and light southerly swell continue to
move through the waters.
