...New UPDATE...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 132 AM PDT Sun Jul 21 2024

Another day of temperatures cooling slightly and a deeper marine
layer, followed by another warm up through this week. A Heat
Advisory and Excessive Heat Warning has been issued for inland
areas, in effect Monday morning through Wednesday night.

.UPDATE...
Issued at 909 AM PDT Sun Jul 21 2024

Drizzlefest this morning with a "No Sky July" start to our Sunday
around the Bay Area and Central Coast. Marine layer remaining
persistent around 1,000 feet with decent inland valley coverage.
Even thought automates gages didn`t pick up much precip this
morning numerous reports of heavy drizzle and wet roads were
received around the Monterey Bay region. Over the last hour the
inland marine layer is already retreating back to the coast.
Clearing will be slow inside SF Bay and may struggle to clear at
all along the Monterey Bay Coast.

No update needed for the short term forecast. Biggest weather
impacts for the upcoming work week will be ongoing heat related
hazards and very low potential for thunderstorms.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 132 AM PDT Sun Jul 21 2024

A deeper marine layer this morning to about 1000-1500 feet, per
the vertical profilers. This is allowing cooler overnight temps
reaching further inland, and much cooler temps reaching some parts
of higher elevation areas. For example, most locations are
running about 4-5 degrees cooler than 24 hours ago, while
locations above about 1000 feet are running 10-20 degrees cooler.
Temps will still heat up nicely this afternoon across the area,
generally running a couple of degrees cooler than yesterday.
However, this just goes to show how much a subtle deepening of the
marine layer can do for overnight relief from the heat at these
higher elevations. Due to the departing shortwave trough and 500
mb heights rising once again, today will be the last day before
temperatures start to rise yet again through the early part of the
week.

.LONG TERM...
(Monday through Saturday)
Issued at 132 AM PDT Sun Jul 21 2024

First, let`s talk about the heat. An Excessive Heat Warning has
been issued for far inland areas of the East Bay, eastern Santa
Clara county, and interior Monterey and San Benito counties. These
are areas where overnight recovery is a concern, where highs will
be near the 100s and lows may struggle to get below about 72. A
Heat Advisory has been issued for the inland North Bay, Santa Cruz
Mtns, Santa Clara Valley, and the southern Salinas Valley. These
are areas that will be hot with highs in the 90s to near 100, but
will see better overnight cooling thanks to the marine layer
remaining mostly intact and returning to inland valleys overnight.
All heat-related highlights are valid from Monday morning until
Wednesday night. Confidence that Tuesday and Wednesday will be the
peak of the heat is on the higher side, with temps starting to
come down a bit by Thursday. As we get into the event, there is
the possibility of extending heat highlights through Thursday, but
will need to wait to gain more confidence on how much temps will
cool through the latter half of the week. Guidance continues to
advertise at-or-below normal temps by next weekend.

Now, let`s talk about thunderstorms. The juxtaposition of the
broad high over the Great Basin and a weak upper low set to move
up the southern West Coast this week will aid in advecting some
monsoonal moisture from the south. How close the upper low passes
relative to the coast could be the moderating factor in how much
of the upper level instability overlaps with the moisture. Current
guidance advertises the low a little far out at sea, which limits
the upper level cooling and puts a hamper on 700-500 mb lapse
rates, thus, limiting elevated convection potential. However,
there will remain some degree of marginal instability as the plume
of moisture advects across our area, so we can`t rule out a dry
thunderstorm or two, particularly Tuesday evening into Wednesday.
For now, the chance is very low, but non-zero.
