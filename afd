.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 326 AM PST Fri Dec 13 2024

Impactful rain returns Friday evening into Saturday with
widespread gusty to strong winds and minor flooding concerns for
the North Bay. Conditions dry out temporarily during the day on
Sunday but light rain is expected to return late Sunday into
Monday.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 326 AM PST Fri Dec 13 2024

Key Messages:

- Next round of impactful rainfall starts to push through this
evening into Saturday and will be accompanied with gusty south winds
throughout the area and minor flooding in the North Bay.
- Gusty south winds begin Friday night and continue into Saturday,
especially along our coastal areas.
- Another round of generally light rain comes late Sunday into
Monday.
- Coastal flooding concerns today through Sunday due to a
combination of high surf and king tides.

KMUX shows scattered light showers continuing across the Bay Area
and Central Coast with more widespread showers located just
offshore. Precipitation totals through early to mid morning will
remain fairly low with most locations seeing a few hundredths to a
few tenths of an inch. Heading into the mid to late morning, we will
start to see a more widespread band of showers gradually move into
the coastal waters with accumulation totals increasing as a weak low
pressure system approaches the northern CA coast at the same time as
a stronger low pressure system approaches the PNW. This band of
showers will reach the North Bay by late morning/early afternoon,
gradually spread into the rest of the Bay Area throughout the late
afternoon/evening, and reach the Central Coast overnight Friday into
Saturday. The most intense rain is continuing to trend overnight
Friday into Saturday with the highest totals across far northern
Sonoma County. Between Friday and Saturday, we are looking at about
2-3" across most of the North Bay with locally higher totals between
3-5" across the North Bay coastal and interior mountains. For the
rest of the Bay Area, totals will range from 0.5-1" with totals
between 1-1.25" across the coastal mountain ranges. Totals have
continued to trend downwards for the Central Coast with generally
less than 0.5" expected everywhere except the Santa Lucia Range
where higher totals between 1-1.5" are possible. The WPC has issued
a slight risk of excessive rainfall across the majority of the North
Bay on Friday and on Saturday. This essentially means there is a
higher risk of flooding due to heavy rainfall. As such, a Flood
Watch will go into effect at 2 PM this afternoon (Friday) for the
North Bay and continue through Sunday. Although drier conditions are
expected on Sunday, river flooding will peak after the heavy
rainfall ends with several large North Bay Rivers set to crest on
Sunday.

Winds will strengthen throughout the day on Friday as the surface
pressure gradient tightens in response to the approaching low
pressure system. NBM guidance continues to be more conservative with
forecast wind speeds/gusts but WRF, ECMWF, and GFS guidance are all
coming into consensus for winds to meet high end Wind Advisories
across the interior and High Wind Warning criteria along the
coastline. A combination of Wind Advisories and High Wind Warnings
(primarily coastal areas and East Bay Hills) are set to go into
effect beginning late this afternoon and continue into Saturday.
Wondering what this translates to? We are looking at widespread
gusts between 30 to 45 mph possible across the interior while gusts
between 50 to 55 mph are possible along the coast and East Bay
Hills. The strongest winds and heaviest precipitation will occur
ahead of cold frontal passage overnight Friday into Saturday. With
both rain and wind concerns set to increase throughout the day on
Friday, take some time Friday morning to make sure your gutters are
clear and leave extra time to reach your destination while driving.
In particular, conditions may start to deteriorate just in time for
the Friday evening commute and worsen throughout the evening.
Especially for residents of the North Bay, if you`re able to avoid
unnecessary travel Friday evening do so.

.LONG TERM...
(Saturday through Thursday)
Issued at 326 AM PST Fri Dec 13 2024

Moderate to heavy rain will continue through the morning on Saturday
with the heaviest rain falling Friday night into Saturday (as
discussed in the Short Term). There is a slight (10-20%) chance of
thunderstorms early to mid morning on Saturday. ECMWF guidance shows
decent CAPE values between 100-300 J/kg directly along the coastline
early tomorrow morning with slightly higher totals over the coastal
waters. Current guidance suggests that if thunderstorms do develop
the most likely timing will be between 5 AM to 11 AM which roughly
correlates to when the cold front will be approaching/moving through
the region. Both thunderstorm and rain chances will taper off by
late Saturday morning with showers becoming more scattered in nature
after cold frontal passage occurs (late Saturday morning/early
Saturday afternoon).

Weak shortwave ridging is set to develop Sunday, allowing us to dry
out for a day, before another shortwave trough brings returned
rainfall chances on Monday. While totals are still fluctuating, the
consensus is that this storm will bring lower amounts of
precipitation than our storm today and tomorrow. In general, the
highest totals will be close to an inch in the North Bay and
generally less than half an inch elsewhere across the Bay Area and
Central Coast. Tuesday through Friday, drier conditions look to
prevail as ridging redevelops over the West Coast. This will allow
us to dry out ahead of peak holiday travel time and finish up any
last minute outdoors decorations. Daytime high temperatures will be
fairly chilly in the 50s to low 60s for the first part of the week
but a slight warming trend (low to mid 60s) will take place
beginning midweek as ridging builds. Cold mornings will return
beginning Sunday with Frost Advisories likely needed across portions
of the North Bay and interior Central Coast.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 505 AM PST Fri Dec 13 2024

The next round of rain is approaching the region and ahead of it,
cigs have bounced around MVFR for much of the Bay Area. Guidance
suggest lowered cig, and perhaps vis at times, for the North Bay
throughout much of the TAF period, while areas in the East Bay and
near San Francisco flirt with MVFR through the morning and
potentially reach VFR by late morning early afternoon. Farther
south, into the Central Coast, VFR conditions are expected to
prevail. The caveat to all of this, of course, is whether or not
rain impacts terminals. The latest CAMs and hi-res guidance shows
the best chances for rain being over the North Bay today, but they
could see some drier or more spotty conditions late morning into the
afternoon. The more substantial part of this weather system looks to
arrive late this evening into Saturday morning. Look for increasing
winds and chances for rain, especially after 0Z-6Z tonight.

Vicinity of SFO...MVFR cigs have been observed and will likely
continue through mid to late morning. The question then becomes
whether or not KSFO and surrounding TAF sites are able to go VFR for
a stretch of time this afternoon. Opted to go the slightly more
optimistic route, with VFR conditions appearing around 18Z and then
lasting through 6Z. This of course could change if precip is able to
fill in around the Bay Area. Should this happen look rain would
reduce cigs and vis. Now, looking to tonight... Confidence has
increased in the wind forecast for the Bay Area. For now, kept the
TAFs holding 34kt gusts after 6Z but there is a decent shot at
getting stronger gusts of 40-45kt winds from 9Z-15Z. Opted to hold
on the Airport Weather Warning to see if timing can be more
solidified this morning.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...Cigs have generally been VFR overnight and
have started flirt or enter MVFR territory for a few hours this
morning. Conditions should improve after sunrise, but should stray
showers make it this far south, reduced cig and vis are possible.
Winds increase late tonight ahead of the stronger part of the storm
system.

.MARINE...
(Today through Wednesday)
Issued at 505 AM PST Fri Dec 13 2024

The next round of rain is entering the waters, and eventually
winds will begin to increase as well. Near gale to gale force
gusts are expected by this afternoon as a stronger storm system
moves into our area. This will bring another round of higher waves
and rain into the weekend. Storm force gusts up to 50 kt, perhaps
55 kt, will be possible starting late tonight and continuing into
late Saturday morning. Dry weather returns for Sunday then
another low brings rain to the coastal waters and bays Monday.

.BEACHES...
Issued at 350 AM PST Thu Dec 12 2024

Previous forecast generally still on track. Still expecting a
larger swell well offshore currently to enter the northern waters
this afternoon. People should use caution if they venture to the
beaches/coastline/bay shoreline through the upcoming weekend.

Previous details: There will be multiple hazards across the Bays,
Pacific Ocean, and their associated beaches as three storm
systems take aim at the West Coast and King Tides return. A
Coastal Flood Advisory has been issued from 6 AM Thursday through
1 PM Monday along the bayshore of the San Francisco Bay and San
Pablo Bay with the highest tides: 6.74 ft at 8:12 am Thursday,
6.98 ft at 8:54 am Friday, 7.07 ft at 9:37 am Saturday, 7.02 ft at
10:22 am Sunday, and 6.82 ft at 11:08 am Monday. These very high
tides in tandem with long period northwesterly swell will allow
for large sets of waves to run a lot farther up the beaches. A
High Surf Advisory has been issued for 1 PM Thursday through 4 AM
Friday for all west and northwest facing beaches for breaking
waves of 18-22 feet. Other impacts will be rip current risk,
longshore current risk, gale-force gusts, slight thunderstorm
chances, and widespread rainfall. There are going to be poor
conditions everywhere, especially on the water or at the beach.
