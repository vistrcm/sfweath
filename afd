.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 109 AM PDT Thu Mar 21 2024

Some model guidance is suggesting fog will develop in the North
Bay later this morning. While the winds are light and a shallow
marine layer is in place, low cloud cover will limit radiational
cooling. For example, Santa Rosa is currently 5 degrees warmer
than this time yesterday. For this reason, the forecast was
adjusted to only mention a brief period of patchy fog before 9 AM.
Otherwise coastal stratus will mix out by noon, allowing for
another pleasant afternoon. A ridge axis extending from high
pressure west of the Baja Peninsula will keep winds light and
temperatures above normal. Enjoy this final day of warm and calm
conditions before the pattern changes on Friday.

Several Bay Area residents posted fantastic sunset pictures
Wednesday evening and there was a request for another sunset
forecast today. The basics of a good sunset are pretty straight-
forward. You want some clouds to reflect the changing light
conditions, but they can`t be too low or thick that they block the
setting sun. The perfect set-up would be a mix of high
cirrostratus and a few mid-level altocumulus clouds overhead, with
clearing near the western horizon. It looks very likely that we
will have the cirrus ahead of Friday`s cold front. The only
concern is whether the thicker rain clouds will stay beyond the
horizon, allowing enough sunlight in to illuminate the high
clouds. The models are split here, but HRRR did a great job with
the cloud cover yesterday and is showing good sunset conditions
today. Overall it looks like there is a good chance for a repeat
of yesterday`s sunset and I`ll be planning my evening run to pass
Asilomar State Beach around 7 PM.

.LONG TERM...
(Friday through Wednesday)
Issued at 109 AM PDT Thu Mar 21 2024

A cold front will move through the Bay Area Friday. We have been
saying that all week, but there have been some changes to the
forecast recently. The front looks to arrive later than previously
thought. Rain is now expected to begin in the North Bay around
mid-day and in the early evening for the Central Coast. In
addition to rain, strong southerly winds will precede frontal
passage. After the front passes, winds will shift to a westerly
direction and the rain will gradually transition from steady, warm
sector rain, to more convective showers on Saturday and Sunday.
Some of these showers may be strong and there is an increasing
chance for thunderstorms this weekend. The temperature will also
drop noticeably behind the cold front. High temperatures have
been in the upper 60s to low 70s this week, but will drop to the
mid 50s to low 60s this weekend. Outside of any thunderstorms,
rain totals for the weekend are looking mostly beneficial with
0.5-1.0" expected for most of the Bay Area.

Beyond Sunday, the rain will taper off, but temperatures will
remain cooler than normal. The next cold front will bring another
round of beneficial rain to the area mid-week.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 454 AM PDT Thu Mar 21 2024

VFR to MVFR across the board. Nighttime microphysics shows a round
of stratus moving into the Bay Area. Confidence remains low that fog
will develop at STS due to overcast low level cloud cover but
guidance continues to hint that it is possible. The nighttime
microphysics product shows some clearing of stratus in the vicinity
of STS and the Siri PG&E Alert Camera shows show fog starting to
develop along the Russian River. If low level cloud cover at STS
clears out, radiational cooling will increase and potentially allow
for fog development between 13-17Z.

Elsewhere, ceiling heights have been alternating between VFR and
MVFR as stratus moves in. Ceiling heights  are leaning towards VFR
at most stations but may temporarily develop MVFR ceilings. VFR will
return to all stations by mid morning before transitioning to MVFR
towards the end of the TAF period ahead of an incoming cold front.
Winds will stay light and variable overnight with moderate onshore
flow returning during the day before weakening and transitioning
southerly overnight. Looking past the end of this TAF period, rain
chances will start to increase across the Bay Area after 12Z on
Friday and after 18Z on Friday for the Central Coast.

Vicinity of SFO...MVFR to VFR. Stratus entering the SF Peninsula is
causing ceilings to fluctuate between VFR and MVFR. While VFR
ceilings are expected to prevail, MVFR ceilings may temporarily
develop between 12 to 16Z. Winds will stay light and variable
through mid morning when moderate onshore flow returns. By early
tomorrow morning, winds will turn southerly ahead of an approaching
cold front with showers starting to approach SFO between 12-18Z.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...VFR conditions will prevail through the
late evening when MVFR conditions will return early tomorrow
morning. Stratus is expected to reach MRY and SNS by 12-13Z with
ceiling heights close to 3000 ft expected. Temporary MVFR CIGs may
develop but VFR CIGs will prevail. Light, variable winds continue
through the early morning before moderate onshore winds return. MVFR
ceilings and southerly winds will develop late tomorrow night ahead
of an approaching cold front. Rain chances increase after the end of
this TAF period.

.MARINE...
(Today through Tuesday)
Issued at 239 AM PDT Thu Mar 21 2024

Light to moderate winds will continue through Thursday. An
approaching low pressure system will bring increased rain chances
and breezy to gusty westerly to southerly winds starting late
Thursday through the weekend. The strongest winds and highest
thunderstorm potential (10 to 20 percent) will occur over the
weekend. Wave heights will gradually increase through the weekend
before diminishing during the start of the work week. A new long
period northwesterly swell train will arrive Thursday as the
previous moderate period northwesterly swell diminishes.
