.UPDATE...
Issued at 845 AM PDT Fri Sep 19 2025

Morning satellite imagery shows a comma-esque cloud field over
NorCal. The cloud structure is tied to the upper level longwave
pattern; a positively tilted upper level trough with an embedded
upper low off CA coast or a cut-off low with a secondary upper
low over NorCal depending on how you slice it. Either way, the
secondary upper low and reflected surface low continues to
generate clouds and shower activity across NorCal. The counter-
clockwise circulation is allowing for a few showers to pivot
through the Bay Area this morning. Did a quick update to the
forecast earlier this morning to included these showers.

For the rest of the day, we`ll see a mix of sun and clouds this
afternoon. Enough residual moisture and daytime heating may allow
for a few showers this afternoon, but mainly over interior
Central Coast.

No other updates at this time.

.SHORT TERM...
Issued at 343 AM PDT Fri Sep 19 2025
(Today and tonight)

Met watch tonight includes keeping an eye on the convective showers
that have either developed in our service area or moved in from the
Valley. The good news is that lightning hasn`t really been detected
in our neck of the woods, and has generally been confined to our
north. Showers are expected to linger throughout the day for
portions of the Bay Area and Central Coast, which may include an
isolated rumble of thunder or two. Rain chances should gradually
diminish into the afternoon and evening.

.LONG TERM...
Issued at 343 AM PDT Fri Sep 19 2025
(Saturday through Thursday)

The upper level pattern is will gradually shift this weekend, with
an upper level trough deepening off the southern coast of CA and
upper level ridging trying to nose in Sunday into early next week.
This should lead to a gradual warming trend through much of the
forecast period; however, ridging gives way to the formerly
aforementioned upper level trough becoming a closed low and moving
into southern CA. As of right now, the forecast looks to be dry into
early next week, with perhaps some cumulus or a rogue shower popping
up over the terrain. The next chance for showers or isolated
thunderstorms looks to be Tuesday into Wednesday.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 513 AM PDT Fri Sep 19 2025

Showers linger around the region into the mid morning. Spotty and
inconsistent low CIGs are forming across the area with some
scattered mid-level clouds. Conditions will improve by mid to
late morning with CIGs potentially taking longer to clear along
the Monterey Bay Peninsula than along the SF Bay/SF Peninsula.
Widespread VFR returns in the afternoon with scattering mid-level
clouds and moderate winds. Winds reduce into the night with CIGS
returning to the coast. MVFR/IFR CIGS become widespread into the
late night and into Saturday morning.

Vicinity of SFO...MVFR CIGs are affecting the SF Bay with some
light shower activity in the area. CIGS erode around 19z as more
moderate and breezy winds build. These winds reduce into the
evening as some low clouds begin to filter into the SFO Bay. These
clouds won`t fill over SFO until early Saturday morning.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...Spotty light rain chances linger into the
mid morning. Low clouds linger through the morning, but clear by
the early afternoon. Stratus looks to return by the late evening
for MRY, but won`t reach SNS until the late night.
