.PREV DISCUSSION...

SHORT TERM...
(Rest of Today through Friday)
Issued at 155 PM PDT Thu May 11 2023

The upper flow pattern will become increasingly meridional as an
upper level ridge builds across the western US and Canada. This
will promote warm and dry conditions across the region with
surface high pressure over the eastern Pacific and thermal
troughing through the Central Valley. Afternoons should be sunny
and mild with morning clouds clearing back towards the coast. Some
late night and early morning fog is also possible, with the
greatest potential for the North Bay valleys. Lows tonight will
dip into the mid to upper 40s, with lower 50s for the SF Peninsula
and along the Big Sur coast. Highs on Friday will reach the 60s
and 70s near the coasts with lower 80s for the warmer inland
valleys.

LONG TERM...
(Saturday through Wednesday)
Issued at 1235 PM PDT Thu May 11 2023

A robust upper ridge will center from the Pacific Northwest through
western Canada this weekend. By early next week the ridge will be
punctured by a weak upper low meandering from the Great Basin
towards the Pacific Northwest. At present it appears the low will be
too far away to spark any convection over our area although showers
and storms may fire over the Sierra and Cascades. Otherwise the main
story is temperatures and they will be on the warm side. The heat
looks to peak this weekend with the typically warmer inland valleys
climbing into the 80s to around 90 for highs. Much like the recent
heat in April this will not be a long-lived event nor are we
expecting records. That said, temperatures this weekend will still
be a good 10-15 degrees above normal with a moderate HeatRisk for
inland areas. So definitely a good idea to take heat related
precautions especially if you have outdoor plans. Increase water
intake, take breaks in the shade, check on your neighbors, and never
leave pets or children inside of locked vehicles. Looking beyond the
weekend the upper pattern is still supportive of large scale ridging
so seasonal to warm temperatures will prevail with dry conditions.

.AVIATION...
(00Z TAFS)
Issued at 425 PM PDT Thu May 11 2023

Lingering patches of MVFR stratus are slowly eroding on the
western San Mateo Peninsula and in the area around MRY. Generally
northwesterly flow continues through the day with gusts up to 20
knots. MVFR-IFR stratus builds again across the region tonight,
with the main SF Bay terminals socked in by midnight. Moderate
confidence (30-40% probability) of fog development at STS
overnight. Stratus should clear around 17-19Z with breezy
northwest flow resuming Friday morning.

Vicinity of SFO...VFR for the rest of the day with breezy northwest
winds gusting to 25 knots. Winds diminish overnight as IFR stratus
comes over the terminal by midnight. Stratus clears around 18-19Z
and northwesterly winds gusting to 25 knots resume Friday afternoon.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...MVFR stratus lingers around MRY with any
clearing only sticking around for a few hours at most. Stratus
builds again around 3Z with greater coverage around 9-10Z. In terms
of stratus burnoff Friday morning, high confidence (at least 90%
probability) for SNS and low to moderate confidence (20-30%
probabilitY) for MRY (Clearing expected around 18-19Z). Breezy
northwest winds, gusting to 20 knots, continue today and after a
break overnight, will resume tomorrow.

&&

.MARINE...as of 09:15 PM PDT Thursday...Moderate to fresh
conditions out of the north will dominate the coastal waters
through the weekend as high pressure builds over the area. Breezy
winds will work their way into the Bay in the afternoons. In
addition a long period southerly swell will be present in the
waters over the next several days creating a shoaling hazard over
near shore shoals.
