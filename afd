...New SYNOPSIS, SHORT TERM, LONG TERM...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 1202 PM PDT Sat Mar 22 2025

A warming trend begins Sunday, with temperatures climbing as much
as 20 degrees above normal from Monday - Tuesday. A weak
disturbance will bring cooler weather and some light rain later in
the week.

.SHORT TERM...
(This evening through Sunday)
Issued at 1202 PM PDT Sat Mar 22 2025

We were a little surprised by the Cazadareo S-band profiler this
morning, which showed rain reaching the ground around 10 AM - 12
PM. KMUX shows decent returns in Sonoma County, and the Santa Rosa
airport was reporting light rain as of 1153 AM. While there isn`t
much support in the model guidance, this light rain makes sense
when considering the very high moisture discovered on the 12Z
sounding (0.98" PW), combined with the short wave trough
currently moving through the Bay Area. The radar shows this rain
is losing organization with decreasing latitude, but we will
probably still get some a few drops south of the Golden Gate and
in the East Bay this afternoon. Even the more organized rain in
the North Bay is more of a novelty, with very little, if any
accumulation expected. Through the afternoon and evening, the
trough will move inland. This will kick off a period of ridge
building that will last through Sunday. That means we`ll have
decreasing cloud cover overnight and a beautiful, warm day on
Sunday. Albeit with some moderate wind along the coast.

&&

.LONG TERM...
(Sunday night through next Friday)
Issued at 1202 PM PDT Sat Mar 22 2025

By Monday morning, there`s high confidence that the 850 mb
temperature will climb to around 15C, or roughly the 95th
percentile for this time of year. At the same time, the ridge axis
will move inland, allowing offshore winds to develop. The warm
air mass, combined with adiabatic heating from downslope flow,
could help some coastal sites challenge daily max temperature
records on Monday and Tuesday. Most areas are expected to be in
the upper 70s to mid 80s from Monday-Tuesday, and the forecast has
slowly been trending warmer. The SFO-WMC gradient is expected to
drop to around -5 mb, which will keep the offshore winds gentle.
In fact, the synoptic forcing may be overpowered by a sea breeze
in the afternoon, especially along the immediate coast. If you`re
going to the beach, beware of the cold water (low to mid-50s),
sneaker wave risk, and don`t forget to bring a light jacket, as
the sea breeze wind shift could bring a chill in the afternoon.
Overnight temperatures will drop into the upper 40s or low 50s, so
it`s a good idea to open the windows at night for those without
air conditioning.

By Wednesday we will start to get some SW flow on the southern
periphery of a storm targeting the Pacific Northwest. This will be
followed by a fast-moving shortwave late Thursday or early Friday.
These disturbances will increase cloud cover, cool things off,
and bring some light rain and moderate wind to the Bay Area
through Thursday. In the extended range, the ensembles are
sticking to a potential atmospheric river which could stall and bring
significant rain from 3/31-4/2. Uncertainty remains high with
timing, intensity, targeted location, and impacts, but the trend
has added a bit of confidence that something notable will happen.
Be sure to stay tuned to the forecast as information will become
more clear as we get closer to the event.

.AVIATION...
(18Z TAFS)
Issued at 1044 AM PDT Sat Mar 22 2025

Mixed bag of conditions today depending on where you are. A
transient shortwave trough is kicking off light showers and
increased cloudiness invof North Bay terminals. Added VCSH to
account for these light, brief showers. Bay Area terminals can
expect some increased cloudiness as this wave moves through as
well, but shower activity is less certain further south.
Currently expecting most terminals to clear to VFR this afternoon,
but still remain under mixed skies with mid/high level clouds.
Conditions look to improve overnight with a drying trend and skies
clearing out.

Vicinity of SFO...MVFR cigs this morning will likely give way to
VFR mixed skies this afternoon, but the degree of impact from the
aforementioned trough is uncertain. Very slight chance that KSFO
holds on the MVFR cigs through the 20Z hour. Will continue to
monitor for adjustments and the need for VCSH. Some patchy cigs
building back in tonight with high confidence of VFR through much
of Sunday.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...Mostly clear conditions today as VFR
prevails through this evening. Not expecting the aforementioned
showers to make it this far south. However, there is a better
chance for MVFR/IFR cigs invof Monterey Bay overnight tonight into
Sunday morning.

.MARINE...
(Today through Thursday)
Issued at 1044 AM PDT Sat Mar 22 2025

The gradient between subtropical high pressure over the NE Pacific
and low pressure near the CA/AZ border is supporting a fresh NW
breeze in the southern waters and a gentle NW breeze in the
northern waters. As this gradient tightens over the next 24 hours,
the fresh breeze will expand throughout the coastal waters and
persist through Monday. Moderate seas will build to very rough by
Thursday due westerly swell from a strong offshore gale.

&&

.BEACHES...
Issued at 450 AM PDT Sat Mar 22 2025

Long period swell will arrive as early as Sunday morning,
bringing an increased risk for sneaker waves through Tuesday.
While the swell height will remain moderate (below 10 feet), the
dominant period will exceed 15 seconds from the NW. These
conditions make sneaker waves more likely. Sneaker waves get their
name because the unexpectedly run farther up the beach than
normal. With warm weather and good surfing conditions, the
exposure to this hazard will likely be higher than normal with
more people expected at the beach. The most important thing is to
be aware of this hazard and to never turn your back on the ocean.
