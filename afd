.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 307 AM PDT Tue Jun 27 2023

Near to below normal temperatures will prevail throughout Tuesday
followed by a warming trend beginning midweek. Hot and dry
conditions are then anticipated across the interior by the end of
the week and into the upcoming weekend.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 307 AM PDT Tue Jun 27 2023

Overall weather conditions are similar to those 24 hours ago with
temperatures running +/- a few degrees. Additionally, stratus has
spread well inland into the region`s valleys given a well-defined
marine layer between 1600-2000 ft in depth. As such, also
expecting patchy drizzle in the region`s favored upslope regions,
again similar to yesterday morning. Expecting inland cloud cover
to dissipate beginning after sunrise with many coastal locations
holding on the mostly cloudy sky conditions much of the day. With
that, temperatures will warm into the low 60s to low 70s near the
coast with 70s to lower 80s inland.

Overnight, not expecting similar conditions as the pattern both in
the boundary layer and aloft do not change much. One thing we may
see is slightly more compression of the marine layer as troughing
begins to be replaced by riding. Thus, expect typical return of
stratus back inland and temperatures cooling into the 50s.

.LONG TERM...
(Wednesday through Monday)
Issued at 307 AM PDT Tue Jun 27 2023

The much anticipated warming trend will begin ever so slightly on
Wednesday with more widespread low/mid 80s across the interior.
In response to building high pressure aloft, temperatures will
tick upward through the remainder of the week. By Friday, interior
areas have a >60% probability of seeing temperatures exceed 90
deg F with the warmest day anticipated to be on Saturday. The
region`s typical hot spots have a 50-70% probability of seeing the
thermometer reach between 100-105 deg F over the weekend.
Meanwhile, persistent onshore flow and its marine influences will
keep conditions much cooler at the coast, generally in the upper
60s to mid 70s with readings in the 80s in the warmer
coastal/bayshore locations. While these warm/hot temperatures are
not unheard of this time of year, it will be a departure from the
unseasonably cool conditions we have had thus far. Thus, HeatRisk
will reach moderate levels for the aforementioned interior areas
from Friday into Sunday. Folks should be reminded the importance
of hydration and to seek cooling during afternoon peak heating.
Also, remember to never leave people or pets unattended in
vehicles.

The high pressure aloft will begin to weaken and potentially
replaced by troughing as we head into early next week and into
Independence Day. Thus, cooling will occur with temperatures
dropping back to near seasonal averages across the interior.
However, grasses across the region will dry out even further in
response to the warm/hot weekend ahead which heightens the concerns
regarding fire incidents. Therefore, it is strongly advised that
residents take necessary precautions to avoid actions that may
initiate fires.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 423 AM PDT Tue Jun 27 2023

IFR conditions being observed early this morning for coastal
terminals while MVFR persists for further inland terminals. Cigs
will lift by mid morning, improving to MVFR before VFR later in the
afternoon. Onshore winds will continue today, becoming breezy in the
afternoon with gusts up to 25 knots possible SF Bay terminals
through the evening. Low clouds will return this evening. As high
pressure builds in over the E Pacific, expecting marine layer to
continue to slowly compress, lending to higher confidence of IFR
cigs again tonight.

Vicinity of SFO...IFR cigs continue through 15z with cloud deck
around 800-1000 feet AGL. Light rain was observed earlier at KOAK,
so drizzle possible through 15z as well. Cigs will lift to MVFR
which will persist through 19z. Moderate confidence that SFO sees
clearing to VFR this afternoon, and if the case, will be brief as
low clouds will return again early in the evening. W/NW winds
increase this afternoon gusting up to 25 knots.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...IFR-MVFR cigs will continue through much
of the taf period. Low to moderate confidence that KSNS sees
brief clearing this afternoon. KMRY likely will stay under BKN low
clouds through the taf period, improving to MVFR this afternoon
then becoming IFR later tonight. Onshore winds prevail, becoming
breezy during the afternoon.

.MARINE...
(Today through Sunday)
Issued at 307 AM PDT Tue Jun 27 2023

Northerly winds will persist through the week, remaining strong
to gusty, strengthening during the afternoon and evening hours
each day. During the evenings where winds are strongest,
occasional, low end gale force gusts possible across the northern
waters. Expect these strong breezes to create steep wind waves,
creating hazardous conditions for small craft. Mixed seas continue
with longer period southwest swell and moderate period northwest
swell continuing through the end of the week.
