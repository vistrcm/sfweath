Sky condition is clear (allowing improved radiative cooling vs cloud
cover 24 hours ago) except for few-scattered thin high clouds and
patchy morning mist or fog along the immediate coastline within a
marine layer varying from a few to several hundred feet deep North
Bay to 1600 feet deep over the north Central Coast.

The advertised Heat Advisory goes into effect today for the North
Bay and the East Bay (the advisory expanding to include areas of
the South Bay, interior Monterey county including the southern
Salinas Valley and San Benito county Wednesday-Thursday).

Here are some heat safety tips:

* Stay hydrated and drink plenty of fluids.

* Reduce time spent outdoors or stay in the shade.
* Never leave people or pets unattended in vehicles.
* Use sunscreen if going to the coast or the pool.

Highs today will be mainly above to well above early June normal
high temperatures. Highs will be coolest along the immediate
coastline/beaches with 70s to a few warmer spots not far from the
beaches in the lower 80s, bayside highs will be 80 to 90 with
lower 90s just away from the SF Bay. Farthest inland highs today

(Wednesday through Monday)
Issued at 247 AM PDT Tue Jun 4 2024

As mentioned, the heat advisory continues inland areas Wednesday
and Thursday. Warm to hot daytime highs, above to well above June
normal highs - hottest inland with 90s to lower 100s, nearer the
coast 80s and 90s, and 70s/80 at the beaches. Hot weather will
result in elevated fire weather conditions at least through
Thursday. Improving chances of patchy night and morning coastal
stratus and fog redeveloping later in the week. The NAM forecasts
the SFO-SAC pressure gradient (westerly winds) prevailing Thursday
afternoon and evening, however it still make take an extra day or
two for the afternoon sea breeze to bring some relief farther inland.

A high pressure system is forecast to remain nearly stationary over
the west late this week into next week, surrounded by low pressure
systems of various strength. Weak upper level troughing may reach
California over the weekend, the daily sea breeze likely during
then bringing relief at least partially inland each afternoon and
evening.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 431 AM PDT Tue Jun 4 2024

VFR except for a patch or two of stratus and fog /LIFR-IFR/ along
the immediate coastline this morning. The NAM forecasts the ACV-SFO
pressure gradient to strengthen to nearly 9 mb by later today, the
UKI-STS pressure gradient strong at 2 mb to 3 mb. Local influxes of
cooler marine air will continue nearest the immediate coastline,
for example statistical guidance is forecasting a gusty west wind
to around 30 knots at KSFO this afternoon and evening. Additionally,
the leading edge of stratus and fog approx 300 miles northwest of
the Bay Area where surface dewpoint temps are higher is forecast
to reach our coastline late tonight and Wednesday morning per
recent HREF output; coastal waters sea surface temperatures remain
chilly which favors coastal stratus and fog.

Vicinity of SFO...VFR. Light west wind this morning, increasing to
22 to 32 knots beginning 21z and continuing to mid-late evening.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...VFR. Light and variable winds this morning,
becoming west to northwest winds 5 to 12 knots during the day.
Patchy stratus and/or fog /LIFR-IFR/ early Wednesday morning.

.MARINE...
(Today through Sunday)
Issued at 252 AM PDT Tue Jun 4 2024

Breezy to gusty north and northwest winds affect all of the
waters through the mid week. Meanwhile, large NW swell will arrive
in the coastal waters of Northern and Central California. These
rough seas will last through Thursday. Conditions will then
gradually improve going into the weekend.

&&

.BEACHES...
Issued at 859 PM PDT Mon Jun 3 2024

A Beach Hazards Statement is in effect from Wednesday morning
through Thursday evening.

A moderate-rough NW swell will arrive Wednesday and create large
breaking waves and an increased risk for sneaker waves. Breaking
waves will reach as high as 15-20 ft, especially along steep
beaches. Sneaker waves can run over 100 ft up a dry beach, pulling
people in the water from rocks, jetties, and beaches. Inexperienced
swimmers should stay out of the water. Observe the ocean for 20
minutes before relaxing on the beach. The hot weather inland will
lead to more people visiting the beach this week. Know where
lifeguards are, obey their instructions, and never turn your back
on the ocean!
