.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 250 AM PST Tue Mar 4 2025

We`ve been keeping an eye on the approaching and weakening cold
front that will kick off the mid week rain chances. The warm sector
and higher clouds are building into the area ahead of the front,
making for a warmer and cloudier morning.

The cold front looks to loose significant momentum and moisture in
the outer marine zones in the late morning. By the time the rain
band makes landfall: expect fairly good chances for rain along the
coast through the day, but very light rain, that will not add up to
much. Initial rain chances will fail to make it too far inland, but
there will be a second surge of rain chances later into Tuesday
night and look to last through Thursday.

.LONG TERM...
(Wednesday through Monday)
Issued at 250 AM PST Tue Mar 4 2025

The parent low and associated upper level trough of Tuesday`s cold
front make their way down the coast and moves inland over the SF Bay
Wednesday. This will place scattered shower activity across the Bay
Area through late Thursday. The southern edge of this low manages to
pull in a plume of moisture left off shore by Tuesdays cold front
and push it into the Big Sur Coast, offering more moderate rainfall
rates, with the potential for moments of higher rates. The
orientation of this whole system will keep rain totals light for the
North Bay and totals increase the farther south you are in the CWA.
Which means it`ll be one of the rare events that San Jose will see
more rain than Santa Rosa. ( ~0.5" to ~0.15" respectively)

As of the current forecast, the Tues-Thurs rains add up to:

0.10 to 0.30" for the interior North Bay

0.30" 0.55" for the Bay Area

0.55" to 1.00" for the San Mateo Coast and the southern Santa Clara
Valley as well as Santa Cruz, Monterey, and San Benito counties.

1.00" to 1.20" for the Santa Cruz Mtns

1.20" to 1.75" for the Santa Lucias and Big Sur.

The last few rains from the mid week system exit into Thursday
night.

But we`re not done with rain yet, as longer term models continue to
show the potential for the upper level pattern to turn into a
conveyer belt of low pressure systems starting Sunday. Some of the
extended forecast guidance shows signs that next week`s rains could
be more impactful than what we`re seeing and will see for this week.
But there is still some ironing-out needed to be done when a
forecast gets that far into the extended. Be sure to keep checking
back in for updates!
