...New UPDATE, MARINE...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 325 AM PDT Tue Jul 16 2024

Quiet weather with pleasant seasonal temperatures continues today
with a gradual but steady warm up beginning tomorrow that extends
into the weekend.

&&

.UPDATE...
Issued at 900 AM PDT Tue Jul 16 2024

Inland temperatures this morning are running about the same as
yesterday with a +/- 1 to 2 degree difference. The marine layer is
fairly deep today (Fort Ord Profiler shows a depth of 3000 ft) with
stratus widespread across inland and coastal areas. Stratus is
expected to clear by late morning for most inland areas but may
persist slightly longer directly along the coastline. Seasonal to
slightly below average temperatures continue today with the forecast
warming trend on track to begin by mid to late week. Highs for
inland regions and elevated terrain will largely be in the upper 70s
to low 90s. Areas closer to the coast will see cooler temperatures
with highs ranging from the low 60s to low 70s.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 325 AM PDT Tue Jul 16 2024

Not much change in the short term forecast, however slower
progression overnight of marine stratus over coastal locations and
nearby interior valleys does add uncertainty to todays forecasted
high temperatures, a trend that will need to be watched by the
day shift. Upper level shortwave ridging tomorrow will result in
warmer temperatures (approx 3-5 degree increase) away from the
marine layer influence under mostly sunny skies.

&&

.LONG TERM...
(Wednesday through Monday)
Issued at 325 AM PDT Tue Jul 16 2024

The gradual but steady increase in temperatures for Thursday and
beyond is the result of a shift and expansion west of the high
pressure system responsible for the recent heat wave, back over
our area for the end of this week into the weekend. Both ensemble
and deterministic extended guidance indicate the warming trend as
the dome of high pressure works back in our direction, with good
consensus that widespread extreme heat is unlikely in our area.
However, the typically warm spots, like elevated inland areas will
once again see triple digit heat by the end of the work week and
beyond.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 427 AM PDT Tue Jul 16 2024

Currently seeing a mixed bag of VFR-MVFR at the terminals as stratus
is very slowly starting to move and expand inland. There still
remains moderate-to-high confidence that all terminals will develop
MVFR ceilings this morning. Widespread VFR is expected to prevail by
early this afternoon. Winds will remain onshore through the TAF
period.

Vicinity of SFO...Currently VFR with westerly flow. Stratus will
begin impacting the terminal shortly as it is starting to expand
north from the San Mateo Bridge Approach and east through the San
Bruno Gap. The terminal is expected to improve to VFR by late-
morning with another MVFR ceiling slated to impact the terminal
overnight. Winds will prevail out of the west through the TAF
period.

SFO Bridge Approach...Low clouds are already impacting the San
Mateo Bridge Approach with clearing expected to be similar to the
terminal between 17Z and 18Z.

Monterey Bay Terminals...Currently VFR with easterly flow at MRY and
VFR and calm at SNS. Winds will prevail out of the west/northwest
through the TAF period. Low-end MVFR to IFR ceilings are expected to
impact the terminals this morning with VFR prevailing by this
afternoon.

&&

.MARINE...
(Today through Sunday)
Issued at 900 AM PDT Tue Jul 16 2024

Light southerly breezes will transition to gentle northwesterly
breezes by this afternoon as the subtropical high becomes the
dominant feature and begins to strengthen. The pressure gradient
will begin tightening tomorrow, allowing for northwesterly wind to
increase to a fresh NW breeze with strong gusts. Significant wave
heights will build to rough by Wednesday

.MTR WATCHES/WARNINGS/ADVISORIES...
