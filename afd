.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 04:52 AM PDT Saturday

A Red Flag Warning for isolated dry thunderstorms combined
with dry fuels is in effect until noon today for portions of
interior Monterey county and San Benito county.

&&

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 04:55 AM PDT Saturday

Near term concerns include monitoring high based showers and
isolated wet and dry thunderstorms moving up from the southwest
across the coastal waters and San Luis Obispo County reaching
southern and central Monterey and San Benito Counties early this
morning. Geostationary Lightning Mapper is somewhat active to the
south, plus have had a report of lightning more recently at
Greenfield in Monterey County, including so far a non-wetting rain
< 0.10” reaching the ground with the gauge reporting 0.01” in the
same location. Good to see rain is reaching the ground which is
what the ECMWF and GFS have been forecasting over multiple runs,
wet weather assisted by strengthening divergence with the
subtropical jet stream and increasing precipitable water. It’s
much quieter to the north across the remainder of the forecast
area this morning. Also monitoring coastal stratus and fog per
satellite and observations, visibilities to a half to a quarter
mile in fog are reported along the Monterey Bay this morning. Will
be looking into issuing a dense fog advisory for Monterey Bay and
northern Salinas Valley this morning as well.

Because there’s a mix of wet and dry thunderstorms, will go ahead
and update the Fire Weather Watch to a Red Flag Warning valid
until 12 noon today. The higher resolution mesoscale models show
a gradual decrease in most unstable convective potential energy
within the next couple hours or so, the mean wind flow including
high level subtropical jet stream winds should otherwise help
keep showers moving quickly to the northeast through morning. If
convective parameters last longer today, the day shift can extend
the Red Flag Warning longer if needed.

.LONG TERM...
(Sunday through Friday)
Issued at 04:52 AM PDT Saturday

Warm daytime highs Sunday carryover into Monday then cooling
begins Tuesday with an upper level trough moving from the
northwest. Daytime high temperatures near to slightly below mid
September normals during the period.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 550 AM PDT Sat Sep 9 2023

LIFR conditions across KSTS/KWVI/KMRY/KSNS as dense fog with visbys
around a quarter to a half mile persist. Dense fog should dissipate
by 16z today but IFR cigs may persist through 17z. SF Bay Area
terminals remain clear as stratus stays confined to the coastline.
Breezy NW winds return this afternoon across terminals. Likely
looking at another night of low clouds and patchy, dense fog staying
confined to coastal areas.

Vicinity of SFO…Low clouds staying confined to the western portion
of the SF Peninsula, but given breezy NW winds, tempo included for
IFR cigs through 16z in the case stratus makes it through the San
Bruno gap into sunrise. NW winds will become breezy to gusty again
this afternoon with gusts of 25 knots possible.

SFO Bridge Approach…Bridge approach is clear and will likely stay
cloud free through the morning.

Monterey Bay Terminals…LIFR conditions persist with reduced visbys
around a quarter to a half statute miles being observed at
KMRY/KWVI/KSNS. Visbys will improve after 16z and IFR cigs will last
until 17z. Small chance that a stray shower moves over KMRY terminal
this afternoon. Sea breeze redevelops this afternoon with low clouds
returning this evening around 03-04z.


&&

.MARINE...
(Today through next Wednesday)
Issued at 04:52 AM PDT Saturday

More widespread fresh to strong north-northwesterly winds will
develop this weekend into early next week, especially near the
coastal jets. Stronger winds this weekend will result in steeper
wind waves through next week, which may become hazardous for small
craft vessels. A 4-6 ft, 15-17 second southerly swell generated
from distant hurricane Jova will impact the waters today through
Monday.

&&

.FIRE WEATHER...
Issued at 04:55 AM PDT Saturday

First and foremost a Red Flag Warning has been issued for fire
weather zones 517 and 518 until noon today for isolated
thunderstorms. The reason for the fire weather concerns are
a combination of dry fuels over the higher terrain and a low-end
chance for dry lightning (t-storms with precip less than 0.10”).
Let’s first take a look at the fuels…the fine fuels are dry per
automated sensors and anecdotally per recent grass/veg fires. For
larger fuels, the fuels charts for the Central Coast group maybe a
little misleading as they’re skewed wet due to rains associated
with Tropical Cyclone Hillary (late August). Zones 517/518 largely
escaped the rains from Hillary. Additionally, the Central Coast
group has also been impacted by the marine layer, but a large
portion of 517/518 have been above the marine layer(especially
interior portions saw no impact). Now for the meteorology…All eyes
turn toward Hurricane Jova spinning SW of Baja. While the
official NHC track keeps it harmlessly over the sea it’s the
moisture associated with it that could lead to
thunderstorms/showers over the Central Coast and the Sierra this
weekend. With an upper level trough to the N and high pressure to
the E steering flow aloft is from the S to SW. This flow will help
to pull tropical moisture over the region late tonight and early
Saturday. The leading edge of the moisture can already be seen
advecting into SoCal this afternoon. As higher PWAT moves north
weak upper level jet support will help to destabilize the
atmosphere. Forecast models suggest an increase in MUCAPE (some
point soundings are impressive) with little to no CINH, modified
TT at critical values, and marginal lapse rates. Would like to see
steeper lapse rates aloft, but they’re high enough for some lift.
Forecast soundings continue to advertise rather dry air over the
lower levels adding confidence of virga/weak showers with little
precip. Lastly, some of the parameters on ensemble model guidance
paint a swath of lightning potential over the Central Coast
Saturday. While this event isn’t a slam dunk and not even close to
the 2008 event, enough of a signal is present to warrant dry
thunderstorms (15-20%).

.BEACHES...
Issued at 04:52 AM PDT Saturday

Larger southerly swell of 3 to 4 feet at 15 to 16 seconds will
arrive Saturday morning. This swell originated from Hurricane
Jova and could bring an increased risk of dangerous rip currents
as well as elevated surf, particularly for south facing beaches,
including Santa Cruz. Largest breaking waves of 4 to 8 feet are
most likely where south facing beaches have a steeper slope. As a
result, a Beach Hazards Statement is in effect for the Monterey
Bay and Big Sur coasts Saturday morning through Sunday morning.
While more swell energy will be near the Big Sur Coast down into
southern California, south facing beaches further north (Mavericks
Beach, Stinson Beach, Drakes Beach, etc.) may still experience
more dangerous rip currents this weekend.
