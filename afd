 - Another day of above normal temperatures before slight cooling
   through the weekend.

.SHORT TERM...
Issued at 209 AM PST Thu Feb 5 2026
(Today through Friday)

GOES nighttime microphysics imagery has very weak signatures of
low clouds and fog in pockets of valley locations this morning.
KSTS has had moments of reporting visibility down as low as 1/2
mile, but given the lack of fog on webcams it must be fairly
shallow and localized. As temperatures continue to cool toward day
break, localized pockets of fog may be possible, however,
confidence in dense fog is low at this time and will be monitored
closely.

The region remains under the influence of an upper level high
that is centered near the northern Nevada/southwestern Idaho
border along with a localized area of lower pressure almost 300
miles southeast of San Diego, as analyzed by SPC mesoanalysis.
Clear skies dominate the area with light south to southeasterly
winds. Minimum temperatures were nudged slightly warmer than the
blend this morning for the Salinas and Santa Clara Valleys given
the low level thermal ridge and the chance for downsloping winds
warming temperatures slightly.

Once again looking at satellite imagery, a noticeable cloud bank
out over the ocean is slowly drifting eastward toward the
California coastline. This is associated with a 850-700 mb trough
that is expected to continue to move east-southeast toward the
California coast and phase with the previously mentioned low
southeast of San Diego. This trough will drive cooler air
advection which will limit temperatures to the 60s on Friday, with
isolated far inland areas barely touching 70. Lastly, the NAM is
showing a localized 700 mb vort maxima associated with the
remnants of the San Diego low that drifts toward the Big Sur
coastline on Friday as it phases with the incoming trough. With
the increased moisture being lifted upslope in conjunction with
this vort max, it cannot be completely ruled out that some light
rain/sprinkles develop along the Big Sur coast on Friday. However,
PoPs were limited to below 15 percent currently given the lack of
consistency across the model suite to have any confidence in
timing and occurrence.

.LONG TERM...
Issued at 209 AM PST Thu Feb 5 2026
(Friday night through Wednesday)

A weak ridge is expected to redevelop on Saturday, but the
(relatively) cooler upper air will remain. Temperatures are
expected to be around 5 degrees above normal, but still cooler
than they have been this past week. Other than some partly cloudy
skies in the afternoons, dry conditions are expected for most of
the weekend.

A longwave trough is expected to traverse the northeast Pacific
over the weekend and move toward the British Columbia coastline by
Sunday night. A weak, shortwave trough is expected to eject away
from the parent wave and descend down the western coastline
through Sunday evening. Ensembles continue to highlight the higher
QPF in the Pacific northwest, but just enough moisture should
move southward to provide light rain in the North Bay in the
evening, with a 15 to 25 percent chance of moving southward
overnight.

Beyond Monday morning, another more robust trough is expected to
drop southward from the northeast Pacific. While ensembles are
showing fairly good agreement with a system moving in next week,
there is still a lot of uncertainty in the details. That being
said, it looks like a pattern change that can lead to slightly
wetter and cooler/more seasonable temperatures is expected.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 347 AM PST Thu Feb 5 2026

VFR continues except for patchy morning fog /LIFR-IFR/. High and
mid level cloud layers increase later today, tonight and Friday
helping to lower the probability of radiative cooling to saturation
near ground level i.e. limiting patchy fog development this time
Friday morning. Surface pressure gradients (and winds) remain
directed offshore 7.9 mb WMC-SFO and 2.3 mb SAC-SFO this morning,
however these gradients are forecast to weaken later today, tonight
and Friday.

Vicinity of SFO...VFR. Light southeast to east wind becoming
north-northwest late in the day then light and variable tonight
and Friday morning.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...VFR. Southeast cool air drainage winds
today becoming light and variable mid to late afternoon. Light
southeast winds redevelop tonight and Friday morning.

.MARINE...
(Today through Tuesday)
Issued at 209 AM PST Thu Feb 5 2026

Light south and east winds today will shift to northwest by
Friday. Seas will remain slight to moderate today then rapidly
build into rough seas tonight to Saturday. Winds will increase on
Sunday ahead of an incoming cold front from the Pacific Northwest.

.BEACHES...
Issued at 918 PM PST Wed Feb 4 2026

A Beach Hazards Statement is in effect from midnight tonight to 4
AM PST Friday at all Pacific Coast beaches, then upgrading to a
High Surf Advisory through 9 PM on Saturday. Westerly swell will
bring an increased risk for sneaker waves and strong rip currents
with breaking waves of 14 to 19 feet, increasing to 17 to 22 feet
on Friday.

Remember to stay off of jetties, piers, rocks, and other waterside
infrastructure, remain out of the water, and never turn your back
on the ocean!
