...New AVIATION, MARINE...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 144 AM PDT Tue Oct 15 2024

Relatively quiet weather today as shortwave ridging continues to
dominate. An inside slider event will result in critical fire
weather conditions Thursday through the weekend.

&&

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 144 AM PDT Tue Oct 15 2024

Shortwave ridging will result in near normal temperatures and a
compressed/shallow marine layer through the day. The pattern
begins to change tonight as troughing from a deep upper-level low
in Canada and an associated cold front drops into the area. With
no location expected to receive more than 0.05" inches of
precipitation, this will do nothing to damper the critical fire
weather conditions expected beginning Thursday.

&&

.LONG TERM...
(Wednesday through Monday)
Issued at 144 AM PDT Tue Oct 15 2024

Confidence is increasing in an inside slider event as 60% of global
ensemble members continue to trend towards a stronger, further west
cutoff low solution, this is a reasonable worst case scenario. The
biggest contributors to uncertainty at this time lie in the location
and strength of the cutoff low. As the deep upper-level low digs
into the Great Basin Thursday, strong northerly winds will develop
across the region. Fortunately for fire weather concerns the wind on
Thursday will not yet have an easterly component. This changes as
the upper-level low becomes a cutoff low and digs further south
Friday and winds become northeasterly/offshore, promoting rapid
drying and compressional warming. Relative humidity recovery and
retention will be poor Thursday through Saturday with Thursday night
into Friday morning and Friday night into Saturday morning being the
windiest timeframes. All of this to say critical fire weather
conditions are going to be prevalent Thursday through Saturday.
Extreme precautions should be taken and extreme fire safety should
be exercised this week.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 425 AM PDT Tue Oct 15 2024

Patchwork stratus this morning, with the major Bay Area commercial
terminals (SFO, OAK, SJC) enjoying a clear window. The North Bay
is dealing with IFR and below visibility and ceilings which will
persist through mid-morning. Winds will stay moderate across the
area during the TAF period and may flip to offshore overnight.
High clouds will begin to roll in towards the end of the TAF
period, signaling a disturbance that will cause the marine layer
to expand and should improve aviation weather conditions tonight.

Vicinity of SFO...Somewhat surprisingly the 3 main Bay Area
terminals are still VFR this morning. Guidance is still suggesting
a sunrise surprise will form in the SF Bay and expand in all
directions, even reaching as far as SJC. Since the guidance was
too aggressive with the marine layer stratus so far this morning,
the TAFs are more optimistic and keep all 3 sites VFR through the
day. Otherwise the typical moderate to strong onshore winds will
develop at SFO this afternoon. Looking beyond the TAF period,
there is a good chance for near gale force gusts at SFO on
Thursday afternoon and/or evening as a cold front pushes through.

SFO Bridge Approach...Currently VFR, though a small cloud deck in
the East Bay is expanding over the bridge and may impact the
approach through the morning hours.

Monterey Bay Terminals...LIFR ceilings at both MRY and SNS, with
visibility dropping at both sites. Both sites will be in the junk
through mid morning before a few hours of VFR conditions in the
afternoon. An early return of IFR or worse stratus is expected
before the sun sets.

.MARINE...
(Today through Sunday)
Issued at 425 AM PDT Tue Oct 15 2024

Rough to very rough seas continue across the exposed waters, with
buoys reporting significant wave heights of 10 to 13 feet in a NW
swell, and a fresh to strong NW breeze. Conditions will gradually
improve through Wednesday as the long period swell abates. This
reprieve will be short lived as conditions deteriorate again by
Thursday. A stronger system will bring the possibility for gale
force gusts and rebuild rough seas across the coastal waters.

&&

.FIRE WEATHER...
Issued at 149 AM PDT Tue Oct 15 2024

A Fire Weather Watch is in effect from 11 AM Thursday until 8 PM
Saturday. Normal temperatures, excellent relative humidity
recoveries, and onshore flow will keep fire weather concerns at
ease through Wednesday. Fire weather concerns will be high
Thursday through the weekend as an inside slider event comes to
town. While fuels are near average, they are expected to dry out
as the week progresses. Northerly winds will develop Thursday as
a deep upper-level low digs into the Great Basin. As this digs
further south and becomes a cutoff low, winds will become
northeasterly/offshore. These winds will lead to rapid drying,
compressional warming, poor relative humidity recovery and
retention as low as 15%, and a nonexistent marine layer. The
windiest timeframes will be Thursday night into Friday morning and
Friday night into Saturday morning with winds largely on the
order of 20-30 mph with gusts to 40 mph, isolated gusts to 50 mph
across the highest terrain and ridgetops and through gaps and
passes.

.BEACHES...
Issued at 850 PM PDT Sun Oct 13 2024

Long period northwesterly swell of 13-17 seconds with wave heights
approaching 10 feet will result in a moderate risk of sneaker waves
across all Pacific Coast beaches through at least Wednesday. Large
waves can sweep across the beach without warning, pulling people
into the sea from rocks, jetties, and beaches. Beachgoers should
always remember to observe the ocean for 20 minutes before relaxing
near the water, keep your pets on a leash and away from the water,
and never turn your back on the ocean.
