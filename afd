(and beyond) across portions of the interior Central Coast.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 316 AM PDT Tue Oct 1 2024

Our entire forecast area is under either an Excessive Heat Warning
or Heat Advisory today. A building area of high pressure over open
water to our west will slowly migrate ESE across our area over the
next few days. Albeit light, but steady low to mid level offshore
flow today into early tomorrow will nullify any marine layer effects
allowing for many locations, including coastal areas, to realize
some of their highest temperatures of the year thus far. Overnight
lows across elevated inland areas will be unusually high with an
active thermal belt maintaining overnight temperatures in the mid
70s to mid 80s. Coastal locations will still be well above normal
too, but less impactful - mainly in the low to mid 60s by early
Wednesday morning. Temperatures on Wednesday will back off
slightly over our coastal communities from todays highs, but are
mostly higher everywhere else, thus Moderate to Extreme HeatRisk
will continue area wide into tomorrow as well. Please read the
following for heat safety information:

Heat is the number 1 weather related killer in the United States.
Unfortunately lives will be at risk during this heat wave. Follow
these tips to protect yourself, your loved ones, and your animals.

-Stay inside in an air conditioned environment between 10am and 8pm.
-Suspend unnecessary outdoor activities during the extreme heat, but
if you must be outdoors, take frequent breaks in the shade  or AC
and drink cool water.
-Know the signs and symptoms of Heat Exhaustion vs. Heat Stroke!
Heat Stroke can be deadly if not treated immediately by a medical
professional. Call 911 if you suspect someone is suffering from Heat
Stroke.
-Wear a lifejacket, swim near a lifeguard, and check conditions
before entering the water if going to a river or ocean to cool off.
Rivers and the ocean are extremely cold, and Cold Water Shock can
turn into paralysis and drowning if you are not careful.
-Use a cool and damp towel on your body if you do not have AC and
are feeling hot. Or, take a cool shower or bath.
-Do not leave kids or pets in a parked car.
-Ensure pets and livestock have access to shade and water.

.LONG TERM...
(Wednesday through Monday)
Issued at 316 AM PDT Tue Oct 1 2024

As the upper ridge slowly shifts ESE farther inland by Thursday,
we`ll see a shift in the low to mid-level wind fields. Closer to the
coast, weak onshore flow will return by Thursday behind the ESE
pivoting ridge axis, providing only slight relief from the still
unusually high temps closer to the shoreline. However, the
overnight thermal belts inland and daytime downsloping winds will
keep temperatures in the mid 90s to 110 for most of our interior
locations away and/or above the rebuilding marine layer. Triple
digit heat continues for many inland locations well into the
weekend, along with increasing fire weather concerns as fuels
continue to dry and surface winds gradually increase on the back
side of the shifting dome of high pressure.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 431 AM PDT Tue Oct 1 2024

VFR through the TAF period. High pressure in tandem with light
offshore winds continues to suppress and erode the marine layer.
Therefore, high confidence on no CIGs developing through the TAF
period. However, models are beginning to hint at a return of stratus
out of the south late today and into Wednesday morning. At this time
though, highest confidence is that any stratus that does manage to
form Wednesday morning will be unlikely to advect very far inland
before any moisture is sapped and eroded, preventing cloud
formation.

Otherwise, winds generally light and offshore this morning, but turn
to become generally W/NW this afternoon around 10-12 knots for most
terminals. Winds ease to become light once more into the night.

Vicinity of SFO...VFR through the TAF period. High confidence. Light
E/NE winds will develop this morning, but in the afternoon, winds
turn to become northwesterly and breezy around 14 knots.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...VFR conditions persist through the
remainder of the TAF period. Stratus will begin to creep up the
Monterey coastline this afternoon, though is not expected to cause
CIG formation at area terminals. NW winds will increase in the
afternoon to around 8-12 knots. Winds then diminish and become light
in the late night tonight. FEW low clouds may manage to develop over
the terminal early Wednesday morning as stratus continues to push
northwards.

.MARINE...
(Tonight through next Sunday)
Issued at 1042 PM PDT Mon Sep 30 2024

Fresh to strong northwesterly winds continue over the far
northern outer waters while moderate to fresh winds persist
elsewhere. By Tuesday, northwesterly winds will weaken to moderate
to fresh across the entire coastal waters. Significant wave
heights continue to abate over the outer waters but are expected
to build to 10 to 13 feet again midweek. Fresh to strong
northwesterly winds are expected to redevelop across the outer
waters early Wednesday with unsettled conditions persisting
through late Thursday.

.FIRE WEATHER...
Issued at 316 AM PDT Tue Oct 1 2024

...Near critical fire weather concerns through the late week area
wide, as temperatures rise well above average and humidities reduce
allowing fuels to dry to critical levels. A FIRE WEATHER WATCH has
been issued for portions of Monterey Co Wednesday and Thursday for
critical fire conditions possible as winds increase through that
area...

Temperatures continue to climb today and tomorrow with poor humidity
recoveries and low humidity retention in the interior. The minimum
RH will drop into the low teens or high single digits, with poor
overnight recoveries (around 20%) in the thermal belt. Overall winds
speeds are expected to remain gentle to moderate, with some
potential for breezier and gusty winds for interior mountains. The
extended forecast shows some cooling in the late week but there are
signals for impactful heat through the end of the work week,
especially inland - along with breezier winds across higher
elevations, and the usual gaps and passes.
