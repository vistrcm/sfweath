...New AVIATION...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 257 AM PST Tue Nov 14 2023

The first batch of rain arrives this morning a front moves through
the area. The front`s parent low pulls west and reduces
rain chances later tonight. Another round of rain and storm
chances return Wednesday with increase rain amounts. The full low
pressure system moves over land Friday, offering widespread
showery  into the weekend.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 257 AM PST Tue Nov 14 2023

The first round of rain is moving into the area, which will mean
a morning of light rain and drizzle around the SF Bay and Monterey
Bay, with better chances for rain focused on the North Bay. The
changing momentum of this front`s parent low will have the front
lift to the north, then west later into the day, causing rain
chances to stay focused on the North Bay through the afternoon and
then move back over the sea into the evening. The overnight
forecast package calls for the following rainfall amounts between
now and midnight tonight:

0.10" or less: Monterey Bay, Santa Clara Valley, Interior East Bay

0.11" to 0.30": San Francisco, San Mateo Coast, Oakland, Higher
elevations of the Santa Cruz Mtns, East Bay Hills, Interior Napa Co

0.31" to 0.50": Most of the North Bay

0.51" and Up: Northwestern Sonoma Co, High peaks in Northern Sonoma
Co.

A few of the highest peaks on the Sonoma Coast could near the inch
mark.

.LONG TERM...
(Wednesday through Monday)
Issued at 257 AM PST Tue Nov 14 2023

The mid to long term forecast will continue to make adjustments on
the changing momentum of this low that is churning due west of the
CWA. Recent model and ensemble updates have picked up the multiple
rotations in the low fairly well, but continue to struggle what
those will do to the system`s momentum. This has been one of the
bigger obstacles for this forecast update, capturing how these
rotations will affect the system as a whole.

The current official forecast calls for an unorganized rain band to
push into the Bay Area and Central Coast from the Southwest,
offering widespread rain chances Wednesday evening. The models and
national blend entertain some slight chances for thunderstorms over
the ocean that will approach the coast into Wednesday night. This
band will result in moderate rainfall, but poor organization of the
band may offer locally higher rates, specifically on higher peaks on
the central coast. Most areas are forecasted between 0.20" to 0.50"
starting Wednesday evening through Thursday evening, with coastal
mountains ranging 0.50" to 0.80" and a few high peaks along Big Sur
seeing around an inch.

Thursday and Friday have the low finally moving eastward and inland.
Again, the models and ensemble members are struggling with the
overall momentum change of this low. This means timing and impact
agreement is poor. The current forecast calls for showery and
drizzly conditions through Thursday and into Friday morning. The low
will collect additional moisture from the south and push it into the
Central Coast, resulting in strong rain chances and elevated
rainfall. The rain band looks to spread across the CWA along with
the low center moving inland, allowing for widespread showers and
spotty areas of locally increased rain amounts. Showers weaken
Saturday but linger until early Sunday morning.

Confidence in the short to midterm forecast is good, but this low
pressure has already proven itself to be a challenge to forecast
for. While confidence is good that it will continue to rain into the
weekend, much can change with the timing and the areas that see the
most amount of rain, specifically Friday and Saturday. Please be
prepared and be sure to keep checking in on the forecast as it
develops. Be safe friends!

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 425 AM PST Tue Nov 14 2023

At this time, radar imagery shows showers passing over much of the
North Bay, with just a few scattered showers appearing over the SF
peninsula. Mid to high level clouds are present throughout most
terminals, though conditions are VFR and expected to remain so
through the TAF period. Despite VFR conditions expected through much
of the TAF period, mid to high level clouds will continue to filter
through the region through the day. Shower activity diminishes into
the late morning to early afternoon today for most terminals, with
winds turning to become more W/SW into the afternoon and breezy.
Into the evening hours, winds begin to decrease and slowly turn to
become more S/SE.

Vicinity of SFO...Rain is currently being reported at SFO, though
conditions are VFR and expected to remain so through the TAF period,
with shower activity decreasing into the late morning. Mid to high
level clouds will remain through the TAF period. Current light SE
winds increase but turn to become more SW through the late morning
and early afternoon with max wind speeds out of the SW around 12
knots. Into the evening, SW winds decrease to become light.

SFO Bridge Approach... Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...Currently VFR, not expecting showers to
impact the terminals, though high clouds will be present through the
TAF period. Current breezy SE winds at KSNS are around 16 knots, and
are expected to ease only slightly into the day, slowly turning to
become NW into the late afternoon. Moderate SE drainage winds return
into the late night for both KSNS and KMRY with some hints at low
clouds developing near the KMRY terminal.

.MARINE...
(Today through Sunday)
Issued at 257 AM PST Tue Nov 14 2023

Fresh to strong southerly flow continues to build across  the
waters with locally gusty winds expected through the day. Gale
fore gust will build in the northern outer waters. Expect
deteriorating marine conditions this week as the low pressure
system brings rain and isolated thunderstorms to the region.
Hazardous winds and seas are possible for small craft operators at
times so stay current with the latest forecast information.
