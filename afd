.SHORT TERM...
Issued at 1203 AM PST Mon Jan 5 2026
(Today and tonight)

In a word, wet. The next organized band of showers will move
through with the passage of a cold front today. The current radar
data shows a pretty well-behaved warm sector rain band coming into
range. There have been a few lightning strikes over the ocean
behind the front near a mature extratoprical cyclone. It`s unclear
if the convection will be as deep over land where the instability
is weaker, but this low pressure system will enhance the rain to
some degree this afternoon. The North Bay will be hit the hardest
today, with 1-2" expected in the lower elevations, and up to 4" in
the mountains. The rain will start there as early as 2 AM, and
continue off-and-on through the entire day. Minor urban and small
stream flooding is expected, and there is a slight chance for the
larger rivers to reach minor flood stage. The rest of the Bay
Area will get less rain. There`s quite a bit of disagreement
between the models on how much less, with high resolution guidance
much drier than global models. Outside of the North Bay we could
get anywhere from less than 1/10" or up to 3". The ECMWF ensemble
spread ranges from 0.25" to 2.5" at SFO. That`s a significant
amount of uncertainty to put in the short term section, but with
the heavier line of showers expected to stall somewhere along the
coast, it makes sense. The IQR is more reasonable at 1-1.5", but
the outlier members are just as likely as any other solution in
the ensemble. Cut-off low pressure systems are hard to forecast
because there is nothing obvious moving them along. It`s like a
toddler in a candy store that just let go of their parent`s hand.
Nobody knows what will happen. The exact track of this drifting
feature will have a big influence on the rain totals today. The
system should drift somewhere near the coast of the Bay Area this
afternoon before becoming vertically stacked, drifting south, and
weakening overnight. This will coincide with the passage of a
sharp trough in the jet stream, flipping upper level winds nearly
180 degrees from SW to NE. That changes everything for the rest
of the week.

.LONG TERM...
Issued at 1203 AM PST Mon Jan 5 2026
(Tuesday through Sunday)

In a word, dry. As the upper level winds flip to northerly
following passage of the trough axis, drier, more stable air will
start to move in. Tuesday is a transition day between the wet
stormy pattern we`ve had for the last week, and much drier weather
that arrives in earnest Wednesday. Before we get there, don`t be
surprised to see a couple showers on Tuesday, but nothing
comparable to the last few days. There shouldn`t be any more
flooding concerns, especially after the sun comes up. A weak
trough will move through on Wednesday, but shouldn`t bring more
than clouds. By Thursday, a 500 mb ridge will build and the skies
will clear. The PW will drop below 0.4" (25th percentile), where
it could stay for the next 2 weeks. The clear skies will bring
cold morning temperatures with interior areas dropping into the
30s for the first time since late December. An inside slider
pattern could develop and will bring some offshore winds this
weekend before another ridge builds next week.
