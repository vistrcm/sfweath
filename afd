.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 304 AM PDT Wed Jul 19 2023

Onshore winds are ushering stratus and fog farther inland this
morning, along with a few patches of light drizzle. Most locations
across the forecast area are cooler this morning compared to Tuesday
morning. Stratus and fog will mix out back to the coastline today,
daytime temperatures warming up to near mid July normal interior,
however remaining cooler than normal near the bays and along the
coast. Periodic wildfire smoke and hazy conditions from a wildfire
in southwestern Oregon will stick around in the Bay Area today. Warm
to hot weather continues inland, peaking Friday and Saturday, with
above normal temperatures on tap during the weekend otherwise a
cooling trend develops early to mid next week.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 439 AM PDT Wed Jul 19 2023

The marine layer depth is 1600 feet at Bodega Bay and Fort Ord,
nearly 1000 feet deep at Point Sur. The current onshore SFO-SAC
2.7 mb pressure gradient continues strongest (overnight) compared
to ACV-SFO 1.2 mb and SMX-SFO 0.4 mb; closely monitoring pressure
gradients helps determine how the atmosphere will initiate or get
air in motion. Onshore winds are prevailing and ushering stratus
and fog farther inland at this hour compared to early Tuesday
morning. Model forecasts have hinted at patchy light drizzle
forming this morning as well, and it was added to grid forecasts
for the immediate coastline until about late morning. 24 hour
trends show most locations even far inland are feeling cooler
temperatures this morning. Recent deterministic and statistical
model output have scaled back temperatures a degree or two mainly
over the North Bay today; updated grids to reflect a little cooler
on the daytime highs. Also, the Flat Fire in southwestern OR is
sending smoke toward the Bay Area, more smoke and hazy conditions
likely arriving in the afternoon per recent HRRR and RAP model
wildfire smoke forecasts. Once the marine layer stratus and fog
mix out back to the coastline daytime temperatures will climb to
near mid July normal far inland and remain a few degrees below
normal near the bays and coast. Coastal stratus and fog moves back
inland tonight, a few patches of light drizzle may redevelop, but
will leave it to later shifts to decide if needing to reintroduce
patchy light drizzle tonight.

.LONG TERM...
(Thursday through Tuesday)
Issued at 439 AM PDT Wed Jul 19 2023

The center of a strong 500 mb high pressure system with geopotential
heights ~ 600 decameters remains anchored over TX, NM, AZ and below
normal 500 mb heights (low pressure systems) are located to the
northwest through northeast of this high. The large scale northern
hemisphere pattern continues unsteady with a large rotation rate
of ~ 6 long wave troughs. Over the western & southern CONUS the
aforementioned high will begin retrogressing and by Friday and
Saturday the center of the 500 mb high will have reached AZ and
NV. Sinking, compressing, warming air with the 500 mb high will
edge closer to our forecast area, however it won`t be quite as
strong as it was recently w/r/t 500 mb heights and 850 mb
temperatures, though still near the max moving averages on Oakland
upper air climatology in mid July. Ongoing large scale conditions
continue to favor plenty of northwest winds over the coastal
waters, cold water upwelling, periodic lower level cool air
advection and plenty of water vapor to keep the natural air
conditioner i.e. the marine layer stratus and fog in rather good
shape despite the recent and temporary interruption.

In response to increasingly warmer 925 mb and 850 mb temperatures
during the late week, peaking on Friday and Saturday, surface
daytime highs will respond by warming up ~ 10F compared to today.
This will produce a little more widespread 90s to lower 100s
inland locations, while at the coast and near the bays daytime
highs will be more in the range of mid 60s to 70s, a few lower
80s. With coastal natural air conditioning continuing, heat risks
will be little or none immediate coast to minor inland around the
Bay Shoreline and northern Salinas Valley for example. Heat risks
farthest inland valleys and mountains will be mainly moderate.
Forecast highs Friday and Saturday are currently below the daily
record highs; many records still exist from a 1917 heat wave and
more recently in a 2006 heat wave. On Sunday, a cool down for
inland areas commences since the aforementioned high pressure
system will advance again toward the east with weak 500 mb
troughing developing over northern California.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 535 AM PDT Wed Jul 19 2023

IFR CIGs prevailing this early morning with light winds as marine
stratus intrudes far inland. Clearing to VFR expected towards 16-18Z
for most terminals as stratus mixes out, and lasting through the
evening. Skies generally clear, though maybe a bit hazy particularly
in the North Bay terminals due to transport of smoke from southern
Oregon wildfires into the region by northwesterly winds. That being
said, skies expected to remain in VFR visibility ranges throughout
the day until stratus makes a return in the late evening to reduce
CIGs to MVFR-IFR conditions. Winds generally W/NW increasing into
the afternoon to become breezy around 12-15 knots.

Vicinity of SFO...Clearing expected to VFR in the late morning
around 16-18Z with low to moderate confidence on the exact timing.
As of 16Z, 51% chance of MVFR CIGs, by 17Z, only a 36% chance of
MVFR CIGs. W/NW winds increase into the afternoon with gusts up to
21 knots, then decreasing into the late night. Moderate confidence
(55% probability) that IFR CIGs develop again late Wednesday night
into early Thursday morning. Smoke transport into the region may
bring hazy conditions this afternoon, but still expecting VFR
conditions to prevail until stratus makes a return in the late night
of Wednesday.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO, haze may reduce visibilities
slightly.

Monterey Bay Terminals...LIFR stratus and fog this morning expected
to clear late towards 19Z for KMRY to MVFR and lasting through the
evening (55% chance) before CIGs reduce to IFR and LIFR once again.
High confidence in VFR conditions developing in the early afternoon
at KSNS, though low at KMRY. Winds W/NW up to 12 knots. Stratus
building in again early Wednesday evening with IFR ceilings at KMRY
around 2-3Z, becoming LIFR in the late night.

.MARINE...
(Today through Monday)
Issued at 304 AM PDT Wed Jul 19 2023

Northwest winds persist over the coastal and outer waters with
gusty conditions increasing into the afternoons and early evening
before decreasing, including the SF Bay and Delta. Towards the
weekend, building surface high pressure over the eastern Pacific
will lead to increased northwesterly winds, at times gusting to
gale force conditions. Wind waves will create hazardous conditions
for small craft operators. Light southerly swell persists this
week.

     Thursday for PZZ530.
