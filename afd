...New UPDATE, MARINE...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 310 AM PDT Fri Apr 5 2024

Nasty weather continues today with more rain, wind, and cold. The
weekend will be mostly dry, but the cold will stick around before
a steady warming trend kicks off early next week.

&&

.UPDATE...
Issued at 945 AM PDT Fri Apr 5 2024

Popcorn city on the weather radar this morning. Widely scattered
showers continue to develop over the coastal waters and Central
Coast (Monterey Bay Region). These showers are being fuel by a
weak upper level ripple rotating around the departing upper low to
the east. NUCAPS satellite sounding profiler pass from earlier
this morning indicated a rather unstable airmass over the
coastal/offshore waters. Solid surface CAPE (convective
potential) with little CINH (inhibition). Also of note are low
freezing level and low wet bulb zero heights. As a result, these
showers are small, but pack a punch with downpours of heavy rain
and small hail. A few reports indicating hail covering the ground.
Given the low freezing level precip falling over the higher
terrain is snow. This is confirmed by looking at webcams in the
Santa Lucia range above Big Sur.

For the rest of the day, showers with hail and possible (10-20%)
thunderstorms through at least this afternoon. By that point,
moisture aloft becomes more limited as it moves eastward despite
some lingering instability.

No update needed...will be watching the radar closely through the
afternoon.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 310 AM PDT Fri Apr 5 2024

A cold start to the morning as temperatures have dropped into the
lower 40s and upper 30s across the area. There are some scattered
showers south of the SF Bay this morning, with more numerous
coverage over the coastal waters. The cold air mass remains in
place, and the weather today will be similar to yesterday with
rain showers, small hail, high elevation snow, strong wind and
cold temperatures. The good news is the breaks between the showers
will be longer and the sun may make an appearance here and there.

The big question today is if thunderstorms will develop. The low
pressure has pushed inland and is now centered over the central
Valley. This is reinforcing strong northerly flow over the Bay
Area and keeping the middle atmosphere very cold. This cold air
aloft will continue to support steep lapse rates and instability,
particularly over the relatively warm water. The difference today
is that there is no low pressure system moving through to help
trigger the convection. Instead, we will have to rely on diurnal
heating to get any action over land. The reason the forecast is
challenging today is that there looks to be plenty of sun breaks
to warm the surface, but by the late afternoon, the guidance is
suggesting the moisture tap will be quite weak after a day of
sustained northerly flow behind the low.

.LONG TERM...
(Saturday through Thursday)
Issued at 310 AM PDT Fri Apr 5 2024

As the low continues to exit stage right, the rain will stop and
the clouds will begin to clear. This clearing, combined with the
very cold airmass, will lead to some near-record low temperatures
on Saturday morning. Most areas away from the coast and Bay will
see temperatures in the 30s, with some of the hills and mountains
expected to get below freezing. Saturday morning will be the start
of a long warming trend that will last for the next 5-7 days with
no real chance for precipitation.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 416 AM PDT Fri Apr 5 2024

Showers persist through this morning mainly affecting terminals
south of the Bay Area. Expecting another round of showers for the
Bay Area terminals this afternoon. MVFR cigs through much of the
morning hours for terminals near shower activity, becoming VFR
into the afternoon. Gusty NW winds to 20-25 kts this afternoon,
diminishing late tonight. Skies clear and conditions calm
overnight tonight.

Vicinity of SFO...Intermittent MVFR cigs through this morning
associated with shower activity. Expecting showers to increase in
coverage this afternoon around the Bay Area. Gusty NW winds 25-30
kts this afternoon through the San Bruno Gap, diminishing into the
overnight hours. Skies clear and conditions calm overnight into
Saturday morning.

SFO Approach Bridge...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...SHRA expected to persist through this
morning with MVFR cigs. Gusty NW winds to 25 kts through midday.
Showers gradually come to an end this afternoon with skies
clearing overnight tonight.

.MARINE...
(Today through Wednesday)
Issued at 859 AM PDT Fri Apr 5 2024

Scattered rain showers and strong northwesterly breezes will
continue today. There is still a 35% chance for thunderstorms
this morning with chances diminishing into the afternoon.
Thunderstorms will pose a threat for lightning, locally heavy
rainfall and gusty winds, as well as copious amounts of small hail
due to how cold the air mass still is from the exiting low
pressure system. Winds will diminish into the weekend as the
pressure gradient relaxes and high pressure begins to build in.
