.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 313 AM PDT Sun Mar 9 2025

Pleasant weather today, under mostly sunny skies. Cooling trend sets
in Monday with increasing rain chances beginning late Tuesday night.
Gusty winds and periods of heavy rainfall are expected Wednesday

.UPDATE...
Issued at 823 AM PDT Sun Mar 9 2025

Mostly clear skies and light winds overnight led to an ideal
situation for radiational cooling. Temperatures this morning were
chilly with widespread 30s to low 40s with a handful of spots in
the 40s to 50(coast/hills). Satellite imagery and webcams showed
some patchy fog/low clouds along portions of the immediate
coast,especially Pt Reyes region northward. Temperatures this
afternoon will be a tad cooler than Saturday, but still pleasant
and in the upper 50s to upper 60s. If you have a chance to get
outside today, do so an enjoy the weather before active weather
returns.

Today`s forecast focus will be on rain returning to the region
midweek.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 313 AM PDT Sun Mar 9 2025

Quiet weather today under mostly sunny skies and near normal
temperatures. A deepening area of low pressure approximately a
thousand miles southwest of the Central Coast will gradually move
east toward SOCAL over the next couple of days. Temperatures on
Monday will be slightly cooler than today with increasing cloud
cover as the upper level disturbance passes by our area to the
south.

&&

.LONG TERM...
(Monday through Saturday)
Issued at 313 AM PDT Sun Mar 9 2025

An active and amplified long wave synoptic pattern will result in
multiple rounds of rainfall impacting our area through the extended
forecast. The forecast track of the first disturbance has trended
south over the past couple of days, and a drier forecast to start
the upcoming work week. However, confidence is increasing for a
developing atmospheric river to bring increasing rain chances
beginning late Tuesday with periods of heavy rainfall possible
during the day Wednesday, along with gusty winds and building surf.
The Weather Prediction Center has most of our area in an Excessive
Rainfall Outlook for Wednesday into early Thursday. The active
pattern continues for the end of the upcoming work week into next
weekend when another deepening trough takes aim at our region.

Issued at 439 AM PDT Sun Mar 9 2025

Currently VFR at all terminals with high confidence in VFR through
the TAF period. Winds will be light through the morning, developing
a southerly/southwesterly regime by late-morning as supported by a
shortwave trough off of Point Conception and the parent low in the
Gulf of Alaska. Winds return to light and diurnal flow tonight with
an increase in high clouds from said systems.

Vicinity of SFO...Currently VFR with westerly flow with high
confidence in VFR through the TAF period. Winds will be light
through the morning, increasing out of the south this afternoon.
Light diurnal flow will return tonight.

Monterey Bay Terminals...Currently VFR with drainage flow at both
terminals with high confidence in VFR through the TAF period.
Southwesterly winds will prevail at MRY between late-morning and
evening while SNS will remain terrain blocked and thus resume
diurnal flow in the form of the sea breeze. Light drainage flow will
return to both terminals tonight.
