...New AVIATION, MARINE...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 100 AM PDT Mon Apr 8 2024

Warm up on the way through this week with above normal temps. Wet
weather expected once again by this weekend as a new storm system
approaches.

&&

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 100 AM PDT Mon Apr 8 2024

Temperatures near seasonal normals today as the upper low
responsible for the last several days of rain and wind finally
moves away. A broad high pressure ridge begins to build in its
wake today, kicking off the warming trend into the middle part of
the week. Low temperatures tonight will also be a few degrees
warmer than the previous couple of nights.

Regarding the eclipse... The partial solar eclipse will be
viewable throughout the Bay Area, peaking around 11:16 local time.
Skies will be clear, but remember, a partial solar eclipse is only
viewable using certified eye protection or some means of image
projection such as a pinhole projector. Another interesting way to
view the partial eclipse safely is to look at the shadows cast by
tree leaves. The small spaces between the leaves act as an
aperture, similar to a pinhole projector, and will cast the shape
of the eclipsed sun onto the ground. For live viewing of the total
eclipse, visit nasa.gov.

.LONG TERM...
(Tuesday through Sunday)
Issued at 100 AM PDT Mon Apr 8 2024

Warm temperatures and clear conditions continue through Thursday
with temps 10-15 degrees above seasonal normals Wednesday and
Thursday. Wednesday looks to be the warmest by a slim margin,
where there is high confidence that afternoon highs will be in the
upper 70s to lower 80s inland, and upper 60s to lower 70s along
the coast. Inland areas across the region will see minor Heat Risk
through Thursday, which means that individuals who are extremely
sensitive to heat may experience heat-related illness outdoors.
While the magnitude of the high temperatures themselves don`t seem
impactful, the human body can be taken by surprise with a quick
warm up such as this one, especially the first one of the season.

By Friday, a cooling trend begins as the next deep upper low moves
into the Pacific Northwest. High temperatures Friday look to be at
or just below seasonal normals. The next story after the
temperatures will be the rain. Ensemble guidance has come to a bit
of a better agreement and a little more bullish on rainfall with
this forecast update. Have increased PoPs Friday night through
Saturday to be more in line with medium range ensembles. ECMWF
Extreme Forecast Index just barely advertising an area of high QPF
across the central part of the state. Therefore, not expecting
anything that would cause concern for major flooding at this
point, but definitely some notable precip for mid-April. Current
forecast calls for a drying trend Sunday into early next week.
However, ensemble cluster analysis showing a range of solutions
from a progressive open wave to a slower closed low through the
weekend, so will need more refinement in the forecast before
placing any confidence on amounts and when we dry out afterwards.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 424 AM PDT Mon Apr 8 2024

Mostly VFR today, with a few high clouds and moderate onshore
winds in the afternoon. All visibility issues have been removed
from the 12Z TAFs as the early morning observations confirm dry
air is in place and sunrise is only a couple hours away. There is
still a very slight chance for STS VIS to drop before 15Z or so,
but not enough to include a tempo line.

Vicinity of SFO...VFR through the TAF period. Gusty onshore flow
will reach 20-25 kts at SFO this afternoon. OAK will be more
protected from these WNW winds.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...A small patch of MVFR clouds have
developed over MRY and the ceiling may last for several more
hours. Since the coverage is so localized, there`s a decent chance
it goes scattered much sooner than the TAF suggests (17Z). After
a clear afternoon, patchy MVFR or IFR ceilings are expected to
return overnight.

&&

.MARINE...
(Today through Saturday)
Issued at 424 AM PDT Mon Apr 8 2024

Strong northwest breezes continue through the forecast period
over the waters, diminishing to a gentle to moderate breeze
during the overnight periods in the coastal waters. Dry conditions
prevail through much of the week. A new low pressure system moves
into the area by late week, bringing the next round of widespread
rainfall and near gale force gusts by the end of the week.
