.UPDATE...
Issued at 930 AM PDT Mon Jul 21 2025

The 12Z OAK sounding showed the marine layer has deepened to around
2500 feet with widespread stratus across the Bay Area and Central
Coast. Pretty good coastal drizzle was observed this morning with up
to 0.06" reported across the Bay Area and 0.03" across the Central
Coast. Some offshore clearing is starting to be seen on satellite
with stratus to clear by late this morning. As has been emphasized
over the past few days, winds have picked up along the coast and
across the East Bay Hills. Notably, the Altamont Pass Raws has seen
a peak gust of 50 mph since midnight while most other sites are
peaking between 30 to 40 mph. Winds will stay gusty through the
remainder of today before easing late tonight through Tuesday
morning.

.SHORT TERM...
Issued at 1221 AM PDT Mon Jul 21 2025
(Today and tonight)

The marine layer is deepening as strong onshore winds funnel
through inland gaps and passes. Altamont Pass is reporting WSW
winds gusting to near 50 mph. Fortunately the relative humidity
is quite high tonight, keeping fire danger suppressed. The SFO-
SAC gradient was +3.4 mb at midnight, on a decreasing trend. That
should allow the winds to ease through the morning hours before
the typical diurnal gradient rebuilds this afternoon. The WRF
Ensemble mean builds the gradient back up to +4.3 mb late
afternoon/early evening which should bring similar strength wind
gusts through early Tuesday morning. The deep marine layer, high
relative humidity and strong onshore winds will enhance orographic
lift along the coastal mountains, and there`s a good chance for
drizzle during the morning commute along HWY-1 and the northern
reaches of I-280/HWY-101. Otherwise it will be cooler than
yesterday, with meager clearing in the afternoon and max
temperatures 5-15 degrees below normal.

.LONG TERM...
Issued at 1221 AM PDT Mon Jul 21 2025
(Tuesday through Sunday)

In short, the cool troughing pattern is here to stay. At 500 mb, a
positively tilted trough will likely spawn a cut-off low
Wednesday which will then linger a few days before being picked up
by a more robust troughing pattern this weekend. In the medium
term, this will lead to a relaxed pressure gradient and pretty
benign conditions through the work week. The 850 mb temperature
was last measured at near the 75th percentile for this time of
year (21.8 C). As the trough develops this benchmark will fall,
and there is a 90% chance that it stays below the 25th percentile
(16.5 C) from Tuesday - Thursday. That means cool, cloudy weather
for those in the marine layer and continued comfortable conditions
for those further inland. Later in the week, a high pressure
ridge will gradually build over the desert SW. This will bring a
heat wave to the our neighboring states, and NWS Tuscon is
advertising a 90% chance of temperatures hitting 105 degrees in
their home city next Sunday (7/27). There is no indication that
this ridge will move anywhere near the Bay Area, but the gradient
will increase substantially between our deepening trough offshore
and the building ridge to our SE. This pattern will support 500 mb
winds up to 50 kts from the SW, and should bring another round of
breezy surface winds next weekend. This prolonged cool period is
helping suppress wildfire potential and the Energy Release
Component is either below average or forecast to fall below
average this week for all regions across the Bay Area and Central
Coast.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 551 AM PDT Mon Jul 21 2025

Stratus /MVFR-IFR/ moving inland on onshore winds through morning,
mixing out this afternoon to VFR-MVFR except stratus is likely to
persist along the immediate coastline today. Stratus /MVFR-IFR/
moves inland tonight and Tuesday morning.

Vicinity of SFO...Stratus /MVFR-IFR/ scattering out by 21z today,
stratus returning by 03z this evening. West wind 10 to 15 knots
except 15 to 25 knots in the afternoon and early evening.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...Stratus /MVFR-IFR/ for much if not all
today nearest the bay, KSNS has the best chance of mixing out to
VFR by 19z today. Stratus /MVFR/ moving inland tonight and Tuesday
morning. Onshore winds 5 to 15 knots.

.MARINE...
(Today through Saturday)
Issued at 930 AM PDT Mon Jul 21 2025

Moderate breezes are expected today, resulting in hazardous
boating conditions for smaller vessels in the northern San
Francisco and  San Pablo Bays and across the northern outer
waters. Slight to  moderate seas persist through the remainder of
the forecast period. Winds ease Tuesday through late week.

.CLIMATE...
Issued at 1221 AM PDT Mon Jul 21 2025

This Summer has been cooler than average and that trend will
continue for at least another week. I decided it was a good time
to add a climate section here to compare just how different this
Summer has been than last year. I created a simple head-to-head
scoring system to add days above/below normal weighted by how far
above/below normal they were. For example, if the maximum
temperature was 2 degrees below normal on Saturday and 3 degrees
above normal on Sunday, the score would be 2-3. I focused on max
temperature at San Jose from June 1 - July 20. Meteorological
Summer starts June 1st and San Jose is a good mixture of some
marine layer influence and inland heat depending on the day.
Again, I just made this scoring system up tonight, so hopefully it
makes sense. The results are pretty interesting, particularly
when compared with last year.

2025: Cold: 168, Warm:  36
2024: Cold:  30, Warm: 302
