.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 220 AM PDT Thu Jun 15 2023

Morning low clouds clearing back to the coast afternoon and
evening hours. Temperatures running near to slightly below normal
today through Saturday. Onshore winds increase Sunday with
increasing clouds. Cooler temperatures Monday as an unseasonably
strong upper low passes north of the area. Temperatures remain
near to slightly below normal much of next week with dry weather.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 220 AM PDT Thu Jun 15 2023

Marine layer around 2000 feet this morning with widespread low
clouds across the Bay Area and Central coast early this morning
though coverage overall is a little less extensive than yesterday
morning. In particular there is less coverage over the offshore
coastal waters as strong northerly winds are blowing off Cape
Mendocino with little or no stratus north of Cloverdale. Similar
to the last few days most inland areas will see sunshine with
temps in the 70s this afternoon with 80s for the far interior
valleys while coastal areas will be in the 60s.

Marine layer should stay around 2000 feet deep tonight though it
may compress slightly as high pressure offshore tries to build.
Either way expect low clouds to push inland this evening with lows
in the 50s tonight and 60s in the hills above the inversion
layer.

.LONG TERM...
(Friday through Wednesday)
Issued at 220 AM PDT Thu Jun 15 2023

Continued seasonably mild Friday and Saturday with no big day over
day changes in the weather. Marine layer should stay steady
between 1500-2000 feet as high pressure over the East Pac tries to
briefly nose over the region. Expect night and morning low clouds
followed by sunny afternoons. Seasonal temperatures with highs
70s and lower 80s inland with 60s coastside.

An unseasonably deep trough will drop from the Pacific Northwest
into far Northern California by Sunday. We`ll see increasing
northwest/onshore winds as early as Saturday night that should
bring a push of cooler air and possible marine stratus. The peak
of the cooling will occur Monday with daytime highs only in the
70s inland with cool 60s coast and hills as the trough will
likely mix out the marine inversion layer. Temperatures will
slowly rebound back to near normal Tuesday through Wednesday. EFI
data supports the idea of cool daytime highs and overnight lows
along with stronger than normal onshore winds along the coastline.

Long range ensembles and clusters continue to advertise a general
trough along the West Coast keeping temps on the cool side of
normal. No precip for the Bay Area but continued above normal
precip chances for the mountains of California through the end of
the month.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 425 AM PDT Thu Jun 15 2023

Widespread MVFR and localized IFR cigs being observed early this
morning. Nighttime satellite imagery shows some isolated pockets
of drier air over SFO and SJC, making cigs more intermittent in
these spots. Breezy drainage flow also being observed at SJC. VFR
conditions will return between 17-18z with the exception of
Monterey Bay terminals scattering out later in the afternoon.
Onshore winds will become breezy again during the afternoon with
gusts of 15-22 knots possible for coastal terminals. Persistent
marine layer and steady onshore flow will result in the return of
MVFR cigs tonight.

Vicinity of SFO...Intermittent VFR and MVFR with drier air over
the San Bruno gap currently. MVFR cigs will likely manifest as
the morning progresses, persisting through 17z. Light SW winds
currently but will shift NE late morning before onshore NW flow
kicks in fully in the later afternoon with gusts up to 22 knots.
Westerly winds diminish in the evening and MVFR cigs return after
07z.

SFO Bridge Approach...Bridge approach, according to satellite,
looks to have a more robust cloud deck keeping low ceilings socked
in.

Monterey Bay Terminals...IFR cigs will persist through early
morning before lifting to MVFR levels. VFR conditions possible
after 20-21z but will be short-lived as MVFR cigs return after
01z. Onshore flow expected this afternoon with moments of stronger
gusts in the afternoon.

.MARINE...
(Today through Tuesday)
Issued at 213 AM PDT Thu Jun 15 2023

Northerly winds remain gusty across the northern and outer waters
but will diminish this afternoon before increasing again later in
the evening. In addition, gusty afternoon and evening winds each
day across the San Francisco Bay mainly north of the Bay Bridge
and through the Delta. Seas will be a mix of long period southerly
swell and shorter period NW swell.
