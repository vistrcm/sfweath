...New AVIATION...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 250 AM PST Wed Jan 10 2024

Additional scattered rainfall across much of the area today. Cold
overnight temps last through Friday with Frost/Freeze potential
for inland areas. Rain chances again for Saturday.

&&

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 250 AM PST Wed Jan 10 2024

Deja Vu from yesterday morning...light showers currently entering
the North Bay and northern waters this morning will spread
southward across the area through today. Overall, rainfall does
look to be more widespread than yesterday, but still scattered in
nature. Amounts are expected to be mostly beneficial as the
scattered showers last into the evening hours, bringing many
locations about 0.1-0.25" with up to 0.5" in some of the favored
northwest flow upslope locations...such as the Diablo Range, Mt.
Tam, and the northern portions Santa Lucia Highlands. Valley
locations that will favor downslope in this flow pattern will see
much less rainfall...areas such as Santa Rosa and the southern
half of Monterey county. Shower activity gradually comes to an end
tonight by about midnight as large scale subsidence sets in behind
the trough.

Cold temps once again tonight into Thursday morning, a few degrees
colder than last night. It`s looking increasingly likely that
temps will get down to around the freezing mark in the North and
East Bay valleys.

.LONG TERM...
(Thursday through Tuesday)
Issued at 250 AM PST Wed Jan 10 2024

Drying out Thursday and Friday as a ridge of high pressure builds
off the southern West Coast, with a robust stream of moisture
continuing into the Pacific Northwest. Still an appreciable amount
of uncertainty with the extent of any rainfall on Saturday, but
all eyes are on a rather transient and vigorous shortwave trough
progged to move through the Northwest and join the broad parent
upper low that will then be over the central US/Midwest. Ensemble
guidance strongly supports that this will not be an overly
impactful system. However, a slight shift would greatly impact how
far south higher rainfall totals reach. Since the shortwave is
expected to remain progressive, this does look to be another
mostly beneficial event with only minor, localized impacts.

Drying out once again Sunday as ridging builds back in. Additional
light rain chances again by Tuesday as we remain in an active
pattern.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 419 AM PST Wed Jan 10 2024

VFR across the region at this time. However, into the later morning
hours today, conditions become MVFR as low CIGs develop with
approaching rain showers. Winds will be strong and gusty out of the
W/NW, with gusts up to around 25 knots generally. Into the late
night tonight to the early morning of Thursday, winds slowly
decrease to become less gusty, but remain elevated for many
locations between 7-12 knots overnight. It is not until beyond the
current TAF period that winds are expected to become light (6 knots
and below). CIGs also return to VFR into the late night tonight for
many terminals, with just scattered high clouds present into
Thursday morning.


Vicinity of SFO...MVFR CIGs to develop into the later morning, and
last into the late afternoon. Rain showers are expected to be
scattered today, but have left rain chances in the TAF through at
least 01Z Thursday. Rain overall expected to be light, though
showers may reduce visibilities at times. Winds today strong and
gusty out of the W/NW are expected to almost reach AWW criteria for
the terminal, with gusts currently up to 34 knots in the TAF. This
will be something to keep a close eye on in the late afternoon
today. VFR returns in the evening hours of Wednesday. It is not
until the early to mid morning of Thursday that winds are expected
to drop below 10 knots.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...VFR through the late morning today,
becoming MVFR near noon as low CIGs approach the terminals and rain
chances begin. Winds out of the NW and gusty up to 20 knots
Wednesday afternoon and evening. VFR returns into Thursday morning
as NW winds begin to weaken to 10-12 knots.

.MARINE...
(Today through Monday)
Issued at 250 AM PST Wed Jan 10 2024

Winds are out of the northwest and fresh to strong, causing
hazardous conditions for small craft through at least Thursday
morning. Gale force winds are expected to develop this afternoon
over the far southern waters. Light rain remains possible over
much  of the waters until early late Wednesday night to early
Thursday  morning as a weak system moves through. As rain chances
fade into  Thursday, winds begin to decrease to become moderate.
Moderate  period northwest swell with wave heights of 14-17 feet
continues to  move through the waters. Towards the beginning of
next week, a new  longer period northwest swell train begins to
enter the waters.

.BEACHES...
Issued at 830 PM PST Tue Jan 9 2024

King Tides peak Wednesday through Friday this week. This may
result in minor flooding of vulnerable bayside locations during
high tide cycles. A moderate-period northwest swell will also
arrive around mid week, and the combination of elevated surf and
higher tides could lead to minor oceanside flooding as well. The
most likely time for potential impacts is during the mid morning
to mid afternoon hours from mid to late week. Impacts from this
event should not be as severe as those experienced on December
28-30.

The predicted high tide levels and times for San Francisco are as
follows:

Wednesday January 10: 6.80 ft at 942 AM
Thursday January 11: 6.92 ft at 1030 AM
Friday January 11: 6.88 ft at 1119 AM
