.UPDATE...
Issued at 905 AM PDT Fri Aug 8 2025

Quick update to the forecast this morning to increase fog coverage
and intensity around Monterey Bay region, southern Santa Clara
Valley, and Hollister vicinity. Another morning of a shallow
marine layer led to patchy drizzle and pockets of dense fog.
Hourly trends have shown some improvement. No other updates
needed. Away from the coast/bays it will be another hot one. A few
degrees hotter than yesterday in fact.

Morning satellite imagery also shows some upper level smoke from
the Gifford fire sneaking into southern Monterey county. This will
be the case through this afternoon, including some smoke over
interior San Benito county as well.

.SHORT TERM...
Issued at 428 AM PDT Fri Aug 8 2025
(Today and tonight)

Satellite imagery this morning paints a different picture compared
to yesterday. The main feature being the intrusion of stratus along
the Central Coast and its interior valleys, while stratus hugs
Marin, San Francisco, and San Mateo counties. The marine layer looks
to be around 1000ft based of the Fort Ord profiler which matches
some of the guidance for this morning. Farther north it appears to
be closer to 500-1000ft, which is likely why we haven`t seen stratus
seep into the North Bay this morning. With the marine layer being
shallow, expect stratus to retreat to the coast leaving much of the
area with sunny skies by mid to late morning. These conditions
combined with high pressure building into the region will lead to
warmer conditions today. For those inland and less influenced by the
marine layer, look for temperatures to soar into the 90s, with
interior locations of East Bay, Napa, San Benito, and Monterey
potentially cracking 100 degrees. Moderate HeatRisk is a bit more
widespread given the slight increase in temperatures for these
areas. With that being said, like yesterday I said in yesterday`s
extended discussion, if you`re going to be outdoors, be sure to
practice heat safety. Some pro tips include: wearing sunscreen,
taking breaks, staying hydrated, and looking before you lock your
vehicle.

.LONG TERM...
Issued at 428 AM PDT Fri Aug 8 2025
(Saturday through Thursday)

Upper level ridging builds over the weekend and holds into early
next week. Patches of Moderate HeatRisk are expected for portions of
the East, South, and North Bay while Minor HeatRisk is expected
elsewhere. For those who have to work or are looking to enjoy the
outdoors, be sure to practice heat safety. Wear sunscreen, take
breaks, hydrate, and look before you lock your vehicle.
Additionally, if you`re seeking relief at the beach be mindful of an
energetic surf zone with increased rip currents and sneaker waves.

The ridge looks to break down Tuesday into Wednesday, as an upper
level trough drops in from the north. This will lead to decreasing
temperatures,  for interior locations.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 435 AM PDT Fri Aug 8 2025

Currently a mixed bag of LIFR-VFR at the terminals with a marine
layer of about 1,400 feet. High confidence in widespread VFR by the
afternoon with low stratus sticking close to the coast. With very
little change in the overall pattern through the TAF period,
expect similar conditions tonight as what is underway.

Vicinity of SFO...Currently MVFR with westerly flow. A very generous
MVFR ceiling is being reported with a majority of the stratus
hugging the San Francisco Peninsula Coast. High confidence (80%) on
VFR prevailing through the TAF period. Winds will back (turn
counterclockwise) through the morning before the afternoon sea
breeze kicks in.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...Currently LIFR with southerly flow at MRY
and IFR and calm at SNS. High confidence (75%) on ceilings on the
cusp of LIFR/IFR returning to both terminals tonight.

&&

.MARINE...
(Today through Wednesday)
Issued at 905 AM PDT Fri Aug 8 2025

Fresh to strong northwesterly breezes will wane through Saturday
morning with a gentle to moderate breeze prevailing through
Tuesday. Moderate to rough seas over the weekend will abate to
widespread moderate seas by Monday.

&&

.FIRE WEATHER...
Issued at 920 AM PDT Fri Aug 8 2025

Solid nocturnal drying over the highest peaks last night. Chews
Ridge in the Santa Lucia range above Big Sur "recovered" early in
the night then steadily dropped below 20% by 4 AM. Needless to
say, areas like that would be consider poor on humidity recovery.
Thankfully, winds were not overly strong, just some low end gusts.

That being said, expect elevated fire weather concerns to persist
through Monday given interior heat, low humidity, and daily
afternoon wind gusts. Finer fuel/grass/veg fires seems most
likely.
