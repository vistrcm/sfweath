...New AVIATION...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 251 AM PDT Sat Mar 16 2024

Dry weather conditions and above average temperatures will prevail
through the middle of the upcoming week. Then, unsettled conditions
are projected to return by late week.

&&

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 251 AM PDT Sat Mar 16 2024

Generally light winds have returned to the region early this morning
and will turn more northwesterly by tonight. Otherwise, afternoon
temperatures will range from the low-to-mid 70s across the interior
with mid-to-upper 60s at the coast. Low temperatures tonight will
range from the mid-to-upper 40s to lower 50s near the immediate
coast.

&&

.LONG TERM...
(Sunday through Friday)
Issued at 251 AM PDT Sat Mar 16 2024

High pressure remains in control through midweek and will result in
afternoon temperatures in low-to-mid 70s across the interior with
mid-to-upper 60s at the coast. Lows will generally be in the mid-to-
upper 40s to near 50F at the coast.

Cooler, unsettled weather returns late in the upcoming week and will
continue into the weekend as an upper level trough moves through the
region. However, at this time, rainfall amounts appear to be light
with no widespread flooding concerns.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 417 AM PDT Sat Mar 16 2024

VFR through the day, with light to breezy onshore flow developing in
the afternoon and evening. Model data suggests a low to moderate
confidence (20-50% probability) of widespread marine layer stratus
developing late tonight into Sunday morning. However, significant
spread continues in the model data and confidence is not high enough
to assign ceilings to any terminal at this time. Any ceilings that
do form should dissipate after the end of the 24-hour TAF period.

Vicinity of SFO... VFR conditions today with breezy west winds
developing this afternoon and evening. Marine layer stratus could
develop Sunday morning, but will curve around the East Bay shore
after coming through the Golden Gate. Thus, timing and development
of stratus is still uncertain at SFO. In addition to significant
spread in the model data, have elected to keep SFO at a SCT clouds
at this time. OAK could see a ceiling develop as early as the late
evening hours.

SFO Bridge Approach... Potential for marine layer stratus to impact
the approach path before being observed at the SFO terminal.
Otherwise similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals... VFR through the afternoon, with breezy
offshore drainage flow turning onshore by the afternoon. Low to
moderate confidence (20-50% probability) that marine layer stratus
builds back in later this evening.

&&

.MARINE...
(Today through Thursday)
Issued at 251 AM PDT Sat Mar 16 2024

Gentle breezes continue into early next week as high pressure
lingers over the northeastern Pacific. A moderate to long period
northwest swell is currently propagating through the waters and
will slowly diminish into the work week ahead of another moderate
to long period northwest swell.
