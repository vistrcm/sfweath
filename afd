...New AVIATION...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 310 AM PDT Fri Aug 25 2023

Night and morning clouds clearing to the coast each afternoon will
continue into the weekend. Temperatures will cool slightly today,
but a warming and drying trend will develop over the weekend and
continue through the middle of next week.

&&

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 320 AM PDT Fri Aug 25 2023

Solid deepening of the marine layer overnight per satellite fog
product and profilers. Depth is wavering roughly 2,000- 2,500
feet. The inland push of clouds is also impressive with much of
the inland valleys covered in a clouds. Another thing to note
overnight are the warm temperatures. Despite the deep marine layer
and onshore flow temperatures are rather mild overnight with many
lower elevations struggle to drop into the 50s. Above normal sea
surface temperatures along the coast/bays are currently in the
60s, which is likely leading to the mild overnight temperatures.
For some folks it will feel uncomfortable tonight into Friday
morning thanks to yesterday`s warmth followed by the warmer night
time temperatures.

Given the depth and coverage of clouds overnight thinning will be
a little slower today. Additionally, temperatures today will be a
little cooler than Thursday with highs in the upper 60s to mid 70s
coast/bays and a mix of mid 80s to near 90 inland.

Friday night will be a repeat - low marine layer clouds moving
inland with milder overnight lows.

.LONG TERM...
(Saturday through Thursday)
Issued at 347 AM PDT Fri Aug 25 2023

A shift in the longwave pattern will also give us a shift in the
weather during the long term. An upper low currently spinning off
the NorCal/OR Coast will retrograde ever so slightly while
drifting slowly northward. The large and expansive upper level
ridge of high pressure to the east will begin marching its way
westward. The retreating low and building high will kick off a
gradual warming and drying trend beginning Saturday and peaking
the middle of next week. By next weekend 850mb temperatures reach
the middle 20s deg C, which will translate to above normal
temperatures. Highs will generally be in the upper 60s to lower
80s for coast/bays and upper 80s to lower 100s inland. Needless to
say, Heat Risk will also increase next Monday through Wednesday,
but only peak in the Moderate category. The building ridge will
help to compress the marine layer, which could fade by next
Tuesday/Wednesday with the ridge centered overhead. Additionally,
the pattern shift will help to re- establish stronger northwest
winds by Sunday/Monday. In fact, the latest ensemble guidance and
ECMWF Extreme Forecast Index highlight well above normal
northwest winds over the waters next Tuesday/Wednesday. The
increased northwest surface flow will likely knockdown the above
normal sea surface temperatures.
