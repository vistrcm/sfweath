...New AVIATION...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 301 AM PDT Mon Jul 24 2023

Upper level trough will dig along the West Coast into Monday and
remain in place through the work week. Expect cooler conditions
today and further cooling in the mid to late week. Increasing
onshore flow will foster the development of overnight and morning
low clouds.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 301 AM PDT Mon Jul 24 2023

Here`s a sight for sore eyes: low clouds moving into the SF Bay
as morning begins! This is an indicator of a more robust marine
layer and increased onshore flow. The Monterey Bay had an Otter
Eddy earlier in the night that has since collapsed and allow for
widespread cloud cover to fill around the Monterey Bay and Salinas
Valley. Coastal and bay cloud cover will be slow to exit but
should thin slightly before noon today, leading into a mild
afternoon with near average highs expected.

.LONG TERM...
(Tuesday through Sunday)
Issued at 301 AM PDT Mon Jul 24 2023

The overnight forecast package has added some fine adjustments to
the slight warm up for interior areas on Tuesday. This will be short-
lived as a short-wave trough will increase onshore flow and allow
cooler air move farther inland Wednesday. This makes for a cooler
end of the week and weekend with highs failing to exceed the upper
90s CWA-wide.

The pattern of onshore flow doesn`t look to end anytime soon
according to the longer term models and ensembles. This means near
average temperatures, good humidity recoveries, and a persistent
marine layer is favored as we continue into August.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 438 AM PDT Mon Jul 24 2023

A mix of VFR and LIFR with a chance that KOAK ceilings may become
MVFR heights this morning as satellite shows stratus building
along the coast and spilling over through the San Bruno gap. Since
models conflict on ceiling height for KOAK, TEMPOs were placed
and will be monitored for any necessary amendments. Any stratus
formed over terminals is expected to clear near 16-18Z this
morning. The marine layer is expected to return tonight along the
coast, creating possible MVFR ceilings near KOAK and allowing for
IFR and LIFR ceilings to form again near Monterey Bay. Otherwise,
expect VFR to prevail through the TAF period for the remainder of
the TAF sites. Onshore winds are expected to become breezy up to
12-19 knots this afternoon with a return of light to moderate
winds tonight.

Vicinity of SFO...VFR continues with high confidence that VFR will
prevail through the TAF period with occasional few clouds passing
over the terminal. Expect onshore winds to become gusty and breezy
near the afternoon up to 25-26 knots then diminishing towards the
night.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...LIFR with a expectation that ceilings with
lift and improve to VFR near 17-18Z. Stratus is expected to rebuild
along the coast creating IFR to LIFR conditions over the terminals.
Winds are expected to remain light to moderate for KMRY through the
TAF period, while KSNS is expected to become breezy this
afternoon.

.MARINE...
(Today through Saturday)
Issued at 301 AM PDT Mon Jul 24 2023

Fresh to strong northwest winds continue over the local waters
through the middle part of the workweek. Gale to near-gale force
gusts are possible near coastal jet regions. Wind waves will
create hazardous conditions for small craft operators. Light
southerly swell persists through the week, with a northwest swell
arriving towards mid week.
