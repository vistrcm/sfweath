...New UPDATE...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 247 AM PDT Sat Apr 20 2024

Slight warming trend across the interior through Monday with
diminishing marine influences near the coast. Potential
drizzle/light rain chances mid-to-late next week.

&&

.UPDATE...
Issued at 838 AM PDT Sat Apr 20 2024

Morning satellite imagery definitely has a summer esque vibe to
it. Shallow marine layer has led to stratus along portions of the
coastal waters and much of the inland valleys this morning. Fort
Ord/Bodega Bay profilers and KOAK sounding put the depth closer to
1200-1400 feet. Interesting to note that stratus is a little more
broken up around SF Bay, which is likely due to passing mid-high
level clouds overhead. These clouds may be limiting the amount of
cooling at the top of the marine layer and thus disrupting the
stratus deck. Similar to summer the marine layer/stratus deck will
linger through 10 AM before giving way to sunshine. As noted
below temps this afternoon will top out in the upper 70s to lower
80s in the warmest inland locations. Given the time of year these
temperatures will yield minor Heat Risk concerns. Regardless, if
you have outdoor plans today wear sunscreen and have adequate
hydration.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 247 AM PDT Sat Apr 20 2024

Expecting patchy coastal drizzle in the favored upslope regions
this morning with conditions improving by late morning. This is as
the marine layer remains around 1,000 feet in depth and will mix
out by the afternoon. Inland temperatures are expected to reach
the mid-to- upper 70s with coastal areas in the low 60s to low 70s
this afternoon. Winds will be on the increase by this afternoon
and will become breezy with northwest gusts between 25-35 mph near
the coast, the coastal hills, and higher peaks across the region.
Overnight, temperatures will largely cool into the upper 40s to
lower 50s.

.LONG TERM...
(Sunday through Friday)
Issued at 247 AM PDT Sat Apr 20 2024

Sunday and Monday will continue to be warm inland with
temperatures more likely to reach the lower 80s across the
interior. Meanwhile, coastal areas will peak in the low 60s to low
70s as the marine influence begins to diminish. By Tuesday,
conditions cool as a well- advertised upper level low approaches
and moves through the region. Cooler, unsettled weather will
continue through late week with increased cloud cover and
potential for light rainfall. Most likely scenario will be drizzle
near the coast and in the hills with possible light rain
elsewhere.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 509 AM PDT Sat Apr 20 2024

Satellite imagery shows stratus blanketing much off the central
coast of California. Many coastal and bay shore terminals this
morning are reporting LIFR/IFR CIGs as a result. Clearing of
stratus and a return to VFR is expected into the later morning
today, generally between 15-17Z as daytime heating begins and
clouds begin to mix out. Winds to be onshore and moderate today,
with gusts up to around 20 to 25 knots for terminals near coastal
gaps. Wind then slowly eases into the late night tonight to early
morning of Sunday. As winds begin to ease in the lower levels,
some wind shear may be present in the evening for the North Bay
terminals. With winds providing turbulent mixing, stratus is not
expected to make a robust return Sunday morning. A few near-shore
locations may see FEW low clouds form, but confidence is low at
this time for a widespread return of stratus.



Vicinity of SFO...MVFR conditions last through sunrise. Models seem
to have good agreement in stratus beginning to dissipate around the
15-16Z hour. Confidence in clearing near this timeframe is moderate.
Otherwise, expect a return of VFR in the morning today with winds
increasing out of W/NW to become moderate this afternoon and
evening, gusting up to around 25 knots. Winds slowly dissipate into
the late night. VFR persists through the end of the TAF period.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...LIFR/IFR conditions persist through the
morning. Stratus expected to begin to lift and mix out towards
17/18Z, bringing a return of VFR conditions. VFR lasts through the
remainder of the TAF period. Breezy winds out of the W/NW in the
afternoon and evening today.

.MARINE...
(Today through Thursday)
Issued at 247 AM PDT Sat Apr 20 2024

Northerly winds build into the afternoon today to become fresh to
strong across much of the waters through early Monday morning.
Gale force gusts are expected over the far northern outer waters
in this same time period, but begin to diminish late Sunday night.
Northwest swell builds Sunday as gusty conditions continue but
looks to diminish towards the middle part of the next week. Light
southerly swell continues to move through the waters this weekend
and through the upcoming work week.
