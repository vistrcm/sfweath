...New AVIATION...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 239 AM PDT Tue Oct 10 2023

Another round of light rain coming through today as a second cold
front passes through the region. Dry conditions for the next couple
of days with the next chances of rain towards the weekend.

&&

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 239 AM PDT Tue Oct 10 2023

Low- to mid-level cloud cover as seen on the satellite fog
difference product is keeping the region somewhat warmer than this
time last night, with temperatures across the region predominantly
in the 60s as of the time of writing. Still expecting lows to drop
into the mid 50s to the low 60s for most, with temperatures into the
low 50s in the North Bay and southern Monterey and San Benito
counties. High temperatures will be somewhat below average today, as
the inland valleys rise to the mid 60s to low 70s while coastal
regions top out at the low 60s. The main driver will be a second
cold front that will bring another shot of rain to the region,
primarily the North Bay. As with yesterday, rainfall totals will not
be impressive, with the higher elevations of the North Bay topping
out at a tenth to two tenths of an inch, and the Sonoma Valley and
San Mateo Peninsula receiving a few hundredths of an inch. The rest
of the region will be lucky to receive even one to two hundredths of
an inch of rain.

.LONG TERM...
(Wednesday through Monday)
Issued at 239 AM PDT Tue Oct 10 2023

After the cold front passes, the weather remains dry, at least
through early Friday, as temperatures slowly recover to seasonal
averages. By Thursday, inland valleys will see highs from the upper
70s to lower 80s, the Bayshore recording highs in the mid 70s, and
the coasts seeing temperatures from the mid 60s to the low 70s.

The next chance for rain comes to the state later on Friday, as a
developing upper level trough approaches the western United States.
While ensemble models currently have the brunt of the impacts aimed
towards the Pacific Northwest, our region could still get fringe
impacts from the system, and confidence is low as to the system`s
timing and placement. Thus any attempt at diagnosing specific
rainfall patterns and totals is premature at this stage. The initial
impacts should move into the range of reliable model data throughout
the week, so stay tuned as we refine the forecast.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 433 AM PDT Tue Oct 10 2023

the mixing of low to mid clouds is lingering but there is clearing
to the north which will spread south through the morning. Expect
widespread MVFR CIGs into the morning ahead of this north to south
clearing with pockets of IFR. Winds remain light through the
morning. CIGs lift and thin from north to south starting in the
early morning with widespread VFR expected around noon. The next
front enters the region late this afternoon bringing MVFR CIGs
and drizzle chances to the North Bay. Those chances spread farther
south in the late afternoon and through that evening. Behind the
front brings breezy winds and VFR.


Vicinity of SFO...MFVR lasts into mid morning with light winds.
Moderate westerly winds build into the late morning with VFR
conditions lasting into the late afternoon. The next front will move
into the SF Bay late this afternoon, brining MVFR CIGs as well as
drizzle and mist. These precip chances last into the night before
conditions clear behind the front.


SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO

Monterey Bay Terminals...MVFR/IFR around the Monterey Bay last until
the late morning with some areas of mist. Winds will remain light
before moderate westerly winds build before noon as skies clear.
Drizzle and mist chances return into the evening as MVFR CIGs move
into the area along a cold front. Expect clearing to take place
later into the night.

.MARINE...
(Today through Sunday)
Issued at 239 AM PDT Tue Oct 10 2023

Stronger westerly winds develop this afternoon as another front
passes through the area. Expect some chances for light rain and
building breezes across the waters into the night. Gusts increase
overnight, leading to gale criteria in the southern waters.
Elevated seas are expected as a 9 to 11 foot moderate period
northwest  swell arrives on Wednesday. The combined winds and seas
will  result in hazardous conditions for small craft operators for
mid  to late week.
