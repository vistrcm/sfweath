...New SYNOPSIS, SHORT TERM, LONG TERM, AVIATION, MARINE...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 408 AM PST Mon Nov 25 2024

Wet weather continues with rain chances increasing across the region
throughout the day. Tomorrow, rain should become more showery
tomorrow and then gradually taper of from north to south as we head
into Wednesday morning. Unfortunately, showers try to sneak back
into the forecast for Turkey Day, around a 15-30% chance for the
Central Coast, San Francisco Peninsula, and portions of the East and
South Bays. Dry weather returns for the weekend.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and Tuesday Night)
Issued at 408 AM PST Mon Nov 25 2024

The forecast looks to remain on track with rain spreading over the
Central Coast and showers skirting over the North Bay. Rain chances
will continue to increase throughout the day as we tap into some
moisture. Bay Area rainfall totals through Tue night remain around
0.25-0.5" inches while the Central Coast generally ranges from 1.0-
2.0", locally up to 2.0-5.0" inches in the Monterey and San Benito
mountains. Precip will begin to wind down Tuesday, from north to
south on Tuesday as low pressure moves onshore. Showers eventually
taper off for the Central Coast late Tuesday night into Wednesday
morning. In addition to the rain, southerly winds will increase
today with gusts generally around 20-30 mph. Winds decrease late
tonight and into early Tuesday morning.

.LONG TERM...
(Wednesday through Sunday)
Issued at 408 AM PST Mon Nov 25 2024

Showers should gradually come to an end early Wednesday morning.
Surface high pressure develops. This should keep us dry through
Wednesday and perhaps Thursday. NBM guidance kept some showers in
the forecast for Central Coast, sneaking up to the San Francisco
Peninsula, South Bay, and portions of the East Bay. The good news is
that the various ensembles generally favor drier weather, with few
members showing showers. The 15-30% chance of rain seems like a safe
bet for the forecast, and we could even seen chances diminish.
Higher chances for showers will be on Friday as a weak disturbance
passes by on Friday. Beyond that, clusters and ensembles show strong
ridging building over the west leading to dry weather for the end of
Nov and beginning of Dec.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 408 AM PST Mon Nov 25 2024

The next storm system lurking off the coast is already spreading
CIGS and precip across the region.  More of a classic S flow event
thus far with some precip and higher cigs. 12Z TAFs will have a
mixed bag of MVFR to VFR conditions through the period.  VCSH to -RA
is a good way to convey precip as precip will be with in 10 miles of
the airport at times to raining on the terminal.  Southerly flow
will be gusty as times as well. Some improvement at tail end
of 30 hr tafs. Overall confidence is medium to low.

Vicinity of SFO...SE flow with light rain expected through the AM
rush.  Definitely not favorable with wet runways and SE winds. Winds
will be 10kt, but could reach 15kt (20-30%). Low conf, but will
allow for a wind shift this afternoon to NE as low gets closer to
coast. Winds then shift westerly by this evening. Def low
confidence on wind direction.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...MVFR to VFR for much of the TAF pd.  The
real highlight will be SE flow, very gusty at times for SNS.  Gusts
up to 30 kt possible.

&&

.MARINE...
(Today through Saturday)
Issued at 408 AM PST Mon Nov 25 2024

A low pressure system spinning off the Central Coast will bring
gusty southerly winds and rain to the coastal waters on Monday.
Winds will be strongest south of Monterey Bay with occasional gale
force gusts up to 40 kt. The stronger winds will result in steep
wind waves and erratic seas. Winds will quickly weaken Monday
night as the storm exits the region. Unsettled weather will
continue for much of the upcoming week.

.MTR WATCHES/WARNINGS/ADVISORIES...
CA...None.
PZ...Small Craft Advisory from 9 AM this morning to 9 PM PST this
     evening for Mry Bay.
