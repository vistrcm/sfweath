...New AVIATION...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 312 AM PDT Sun Jul 23 2023

A cooling trend begins today and continues into Monday. More
cooling into the mid and late week and a trough patten deepens.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 312 AM PDT Sun Jul 23 2023

The changing pattern and movement of higher clouds looks to be
preventing much in the way of fog formation this morning. But the
forecast team is more excited about what the pattern change will
bring! While the coast will only see modest changes in temperature,
the interior areas will finally see some relief from the heat.
Sunday marks the first day of a quick cooling trend, with interior
areas shedding 5 to 10 degrees for afternoon highs, and in a few
locations, overnight lows.

As the new troughing pattern begins to deepen for the west coast,
things will continue to cool into Monday.

.LONG TERM...
(Monday through Saturday)
Issued at 312 AM PDT Sun Jul 23 2023

The pattern for the next work week has only seen slight changes
within the last few model updates but a trend of additional cooling
is starting to reveal itself for the mid to late week.

Expect further cooling on Monday for the inland areas with Tuesday
seeing fairly similar numbers as Monday both in highs and lows. The
additional onshore flow of a short-wave trough will call for more of
that cool marine air to move inland Wednesday and Thursday. This is
setting Thursday up to be the coolest day of the week overall with
highs failing to exceed the upper 90s CWA-wide. The increased marine
influence will also help with overnight humidity recoveries, easing
some of the recent fire concerns.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 439 AM PDT Sun Jul 23 2023

VFR conditions continues to prevail with high confidence that
ceilings will remain VFR throughout the TAF period for all terminals
north of Monterey Bay and KOAK. Fog and other visibility issues are
no longer a concern as much as it was the previous mornings. Models
show that Monterey Bay is expected to see some stratus pushing over
the terminals but moderate confidence it will lower to IFR this
morning. If stratus occurs this morning, expect clearing for all
terminals near 16-17Z with a return of stratus early tomorrow
morning as the marine layer returns near the coast as cooler
temperatures from the weather pattern change creates favorable
conditions for stratus. Most terminals is expected to remain VFR but
KOAK and Monterey Bay terminals may experience MVFR/IFR ceilings
early tomorrow morning. Onshore winds are expected to become breezy
up to 12-19 knots towards the afternoon with a return to light to
moderate winds tonight.

Vicinity of SFO...High confidence that VFR will prevail through
the TAF period with winds increasing this afternoon with chances
of gusty winds up to 25 knots. Occasional high clouds may funnel
through over the terminals, but no indication of any flight
category changes. Winds will return to moderate tonight.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...VFR currently with uncertainty if IFR
ceilings will develop as the pattern change has delayed the return
of stratus more than anticipated. If stratus occurs, expect near 14Z
this morning with a clearing near 16-17Z. Moderate confidence of
timing and height of ceilings returning tonight but expect IFR
ceilings near 09-10Z tonight.

.MARINE...
(Today through Friday)
Issued at 312 AM PDT Sun Jul 23 2023

Fresh to strong northwesterly winds persist over the coastal and
outer waters through early next week. Strong and gusty winds,
occasionally gusting to near-gale force, are expected for the
remainder of the weekend, especially over the outer waters and
coastal jet regions. Wind waves will create hazardous conditions
for small craft operators. Light southerly swell persists through
the week, with a light northerly swell arriving towards Wednesday
of next week. Visibility reductions in dense fog are likely,
especially during the overnight and early morning hours.
