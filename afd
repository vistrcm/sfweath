...New AVIATION, MARINE...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 240 AM PDT Fri Nov 3 2023

One last dry day in store Friday before rain returns to the North
Bay Saturday. Some light rain will likely propagate as far south
as Santa Cruz County by Sunday. Rain chances remain in the
forecast through Tuesday.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 240 AM PDT Fri Nov 3 2023

A shallow marine layer is developing along the coast as onshore
winds finally make a return after several days of dry offshore
flow. This is causing 5-10 degree higher early morning
temperatures and dew points across the Bay Area compared to 24
hours ago. Abundant sunshine will continue to keep afternoon
temperatures above the seasonal normal, with coastal areas
reaching the mid 70s and inland valleys in the low 80s.

.LONG TERM...
(Saturday through Thursday)
Issued at 240 AM PDT Fri Nov 3 2023

An approaching cold front will bring light rain to the North Bay
beginning Saturday afternoon. As the front gradually progresses
south, light rain will move through the Peninsula and East Bay,
and may reach as far south as the Monterey Bay by Sunday. The
forecast has been trending towards a later arrival, and less rain
overall for the weekend event.

The jet stream will shift south early next week and looks to be
directly over the Bay Area by Tuesday. This will bring periods of
rain and moderate wind through Tuesday, and colder temperatures
by mid-week. While the uncertainty is still pretty high, Wed-Thu
look dry before another system may bring more rain Fri-Sat.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 402 AM PDT Fri Nov 3 2023

VFR through the day today as larger scale ridging continues and a
weak shortwave trough moves out of the area. Skies will mostly clear
of high clouds today as the trough moves away. Winds this afternoon
returning to onshore and mostly light. Breezy to about 12 kts or so
along coastal and gap areas. Increased moisture ahead of the next
deeper trough tonight will contribute to some degree of CIGs into
Saturday morning. Would expect any CIGs to be in the MVFR range
or above given the approaching trough will deepen the marine
layer. However, confidence in the coverage of CIGs is on the lower
end with high clouds also moving through Saturday morning.

Vicinity of SFO...VFR through today with breezy onshore flow 9-12
kts this afternoon. CIGs look to make a return early Saturday
morning with more consistent cloud cover ahead of an approaching
deeper trough. Confidence in the coverage of CIGs on the lower end
due to contamination from high clouds.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...High clouds continue to move through this
morning, clearing by sunrise or shortly after. Winds light to breezy
onshore this afternoon after light SE drainage flow out of the
Salinas Valley this morning. MVFR CIGs make a return this evening
into Saturday morning.

.MARINE...
(Today through Wednesday)
Issued at 402 AM PDT Fri Nov 3 2023

Northerly winds persist into the weekend, with breezy conditions
in the southern coastal waters through Saturday. A new low
pressure system brings rain chances in the northern waters Friday,
then extending farther south in the late weekend. Light westerly
swell with a moderate period continues through the weekend along
with a light, long period southerly swell in the background.
