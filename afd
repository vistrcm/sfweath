...New UPDATE, MARINE...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 246 AM PDT Tue Sep 10 2024

A gradual cool down today as temperatures cool aloft, before a deep
upper level trough brings breezy winds by Wednesday and Thursday.
Temperatures will continue to run near to below seasonal averages
through the upcoming weekend.

&&

.UPDATE...
Issued at 922 AM PDT Tue Sep 10 2024

Stratus is still covering about 80% of the area with a 3,000 feet
deep marine layer. This stratus will dissipate by this afternoon
giving way to plentiful sunshine and maximum temperatures 5-10
degrees below normal.

The only change made to the forecast this morning was to increase
winds for today and tomorrow. While it does not look like criteria
will be met for a Wind Advisory, winds will continue to be a target
of opportunity for the short term forecast as the ridge breaks down
and an upper-level low skirts across the Pacific Northwest.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 246 AM PDT Tue Sep 10 2024

Low clouds are widespread across the region and into most valley
locations this morning with the potential for coastal drizzle. These
conditions will be slow to dissipate late this morning and into the
early afternoon, eventually clearing back to the coast. This will
result in temperatures across the interior running 7-13 degrees
below average and 3-7 degrees below average near the coast.

Tonight, expecting another around of coastal drizzle as a weak
frontal boundary approaches the region. Temperatures generally fall
into the upper 40`s across the colder interior spots to mid-to-upper
50`s the the warmer interior valleys (Santa Clara Valley).

&&

.LONG TERM...
(Wednesday through Monday)
Issued at 246 AM PDT Tue Sep 10 2024

As the weather system shifts into the Intermountain West, a
tightening pressure gradient will develop resulting in breezy to
gusty winds on Wednesday and Thursday. Northwest winds up to 20-30
mph are expected, with afternoon and evening gusts up to 40-50 mph
across the gaps, passes, and the Salinas Valley. Winds are expected
to be onshore on Wednesday but may become offshore (northerly or
northeasterly) especially in the higher terrain across the Interior
North Bay Mountains and the East Bay Hills by Thursday.

Winds ease on Friday with temperatures at or slightly below seasonal
averages that will last through the upcoming weekend as troughing
remains aloft. By Sunday and into Monday, another upper level trough
will provide slight chances of precipitation across the region,
however we are not currently expecting widespread rainfall at this
time. Stay tuned as we remain 6-7 days out and much can change
between now and then.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 515 AM PDT Tue Sep 10 2024

Widespread stratus and MVFR CIGs across the board. CIGs are higher
than originally forecast with an approaching upper level low
pressure system helping the marine layer to deepen to around 2000-
2500 ft. Confidence is lower that CIGs will lower to IFR heights
everywhere except the North Bay where IFR CIGs persist. Stratus is
expected to clear by late morning for most sites with an early
stratus return expected this evening. Winds are expected to
strengthen heading into afternoon/evening with locally gustier
conditions expected throughout the SF Bay region. Beyond this TAF
period, gustier conditions are expected across the Bay Area and
Central Coast as the upper level low moves inland.

Vicinity of SFO...MVFR CIGs to continue through the late morning
before VFR conditions return during the afternoon/evening. Stratus
and MVFR conditions are expected to return early this evening and
persist through late tomorrow morning. Moderate confidence that CIGs
will stay MVFR tonight but GFSLAMP guidance does indicate some
potential for IFR CIGs. Winds become gustier during the
afternoon/evening with gusts up to 25 knots possible today. Just
after the end of this TAF period, winds are expected to strengthen
at SFO and OAK with gusts between 30 to 35 knots possible. Both HRRR
and RAP guidance show a forecast KSFO-KWMC gradient between 8 to 9
hPa which is supportive of stronger winds developing tomorrow.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...MVFR CIGs are expected to persist through
the TAF period at MRY and briefly clear during the afternoon at SNS.
Confidence is low to moderate that CIGs will persist through the TAF
period at MRY with the NBM and HRRR leaning towards this scenario.
The NAMNEST does indicate a brief period of clearing may be possible
at MRY late this morning (around 18-19Z) but stratus would still
return early around 00-02Z. CIGs tonight are expected to start out
as MVFR and gradually lower to become IFR overnight. Winds stay
onshore through the TAF period with more moderate winds expected
during the afternoon/evening.

&&

.MARINE...
(Today through Sunday)
Issued at 922 AM PDT Tue Sep 10 2024

A series of troughs will keep the coastal waters sporting through
the forecast period. Northwest winds will begin to strengthen
late this morning as an upper level low pressure system approaches
from the north. By Wednesday, this system will bring widespread
moderate and gusty north to northwest winds and rough waves across
the coastal waters. A gale watch has been issued for  possible
gale force gusts across the Monterey Bay and inner  coastal waters
extending from Pigeon Point to Point Pinos  Wednesday morning into
Wednesday afternoon. Unsettled conditions  are expected to
continue through the end of the week with a second upper level low
arriving by the late weekend into early next  week.
