.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 228 AM PST Sun Dec 31 2023

conditions return for New Year`s Day. Unsettled weather will
return by late Tuesday and continue into Wednesday. Another storm
system will arrive by late week.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 259 AM PST Sun Dec 31 2023

The surface to lower levels of the atmosphere are nearly
saturated from recent rain, surface observations show a mix of low
clouds and patchy fog. Surface winds are mainly light, however
some surface winds are occasionally undergoing a little more
mixing precluding fog development. Santa Rosa briefly reported
dense fog overnight, however the visibility has since lifted due
to mixing winds. Similarly, Hollister Airport has reported dense
fog at times. Will continue to monitor observations through
morning for areal fog coverage including potentially dense fog
development. Cloud cover will otherwise increase through morning
with a low pressure trough approaching from offshore, a few showers
redevelop during the day. Showers diminishing before midnight tonight
for New Year 2024.

.LONG TERM...
(Monday through Saturday)
Issued at 259 AM PST Sun Dec 31 2023

There`s good forecast model agreement the next upstream 500 mb
trough approaches our forecast area with rain and wind later
Tuesday and Wednesday. A mix of water vapor from the subtropics
and somewhat drier mid-latitude air pulled into the low pressure
system will still bring another decent round of rain to our
forecast area. This will be a colder low pressure system from the
northwest driven by the polar jet stream which will bring lowering
snow levels to the high mountain country, rain to lower elevations.
More wet weather with another low pressure system from the
northwest arrives late week, though details of timing and rain
amounts remain unclear. With wet, wintry weather lining up, it`s a
good idea to check neighboring NWS offices for weather info &
forecasts if planning travel across the high mountain country.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 336 AM PST Sun Dec 31 2023

A mix of VFR and MVFR with light winds. North Bay may experience
LIFR conditions near 14Z but there is uncertainty as models lack
agreement, will monitor if any adjustments is needed to TAFs.
Light showers are still possible but VFR is expected to prevail
from the afternoon into the remaining TAF period with the
exception of KSTS where possibly MVFR visibility may return
overnight. Winds will continue to remain light and variable
through the TAF period.

Vicinity of SFO...Currently VFR with moments of MVFR ceilings,
therefore TEMPO for MVFR is included in the TAFs until 14Z.
Otherwise, expect VFR through the TAF period. Winds will remain
light through the TAF period. Showers are expected near late
morning/early afternoon.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...A mix of VFR and MVFR with light winds.
Expect VFR conditions closer to the afternoon and prevailing through
the remainder of the TAF period. KSNS will experience moderate to
breezy winds near the late morning/early afternoon, otherwise light
to moderate winds through the TAF period for both terminals.

.MARINE...
(Today through Friday)
Issued at 336 AM PST Sun Dec 31 2023

Wave heights continue to diminish into the morning hours bringing
relatively calm conditions over the waters. Another low pressure
system from the Eastern Pacific moves into Southern California
Sunday and Monday. This will bring light rain and south to
southeasterly winds. The next stronger storm looks to bring gusty
southerly winds, more rain, and rough seas to the coastal waters
midweek next week.
