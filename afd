...Dense Fog North Bay This Morning...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 324 AM PDT Tue Oct 17 2023

Hotter temperatures arrive for mid to late week before cooling
ensues this weekend. Hazardous marine and beach conditions
developing tomorrow with sneaker waves, high surf, and rip
currents a concern for beachgoers. If you have beach plans please
use caution and remember to never turn your back on the ocean.

&&

.UPDATE...
Issued at 508 AM PDT Tue Oct 17 2023

Dense Fog Advisory was issued earlier this morning for the North
Bay coast and valleys. Areas of visibility at or below one quarter
mile will continue this morning. Commuters should allow for extra
travel time in these areas and travel carefully. The Dense Fog
Advisory will continue through 10 AM this morning.

&&

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 324 AM PDT Tue Oct 17 2023

A weak upper trough will progress through the region as a surface
cold front dissipates across northern portions of the Bay Area this
morning. Moisture channel imagery early this morning shows a few
passing high clouds, as low stratus and patchy fog hugs portions of
the coastline. By this afternoon any low clouds should clear back
towards the coast as a light northerly wind regime prevails. Highs
today will top out in the mid 70s to upper 80s inland with mid 60s
to mid 70s along the coast and bays. Light offshore winds will
develop overnight with lows ranging from the mid to upper 50s for
the lower elevations with 60s in the hills.

&&

.LONG TERM...
(Wednesday through Monday)
Issued at 324 AM PDT Tue Oct 17 2023

Wednesday and Thursday:

A mid-level high pressure ridge will nose into the area on Wednesday
before gradually progressing into the Four Corners region by
Thursday. Low level thicknesses will rise appreciably under light
offshore boundary layer winds with a notable uptick in
temperatures. Readings should already be quite mild Wednesday
morning, and given favorable downsloping winds they should rise
rather quickly through mid to late afternoon. There is a decent
potential for coastal temperatures to overperform in this scenario,
and this is well represented within the envelope of available model
guidance. For example, the National Blend of Models 50th percentile
(or `most likely` forecast) max temperatures for downtown San
Francisco are 82 and 87 degrees (for Wednesday and Thursday
respectively), while the 90th percentile values (representing a
`reasonable worst case` scenario) are 87 and 91. Given the daytime
heat there will be some overnight relief as low elevation
temperatures drop into the 50s to around 60. However readings in the
hills should remain elevated on Wednesday night in the 60s and 70s.
This will bring HeatRisk levels into the moderate category across
much of the region with a few pockets of major HeatRisk evolving
for the warmest inland spots by Thursday. Given these trends heat
products may be necessary for some areas by late week. Stay tuned
for updates. Regardless make sure to practice heat safety by
doing the following:

* Stay hydrated and drink plenty of fluids.
* Wear lightweight, light-colored clothing.
* Reduce time spent outdoors or stay in the shade.
* Never leave people or pets unattended in vehicles.

Friday through Monday:

The upper ridge shifts away to our east by late week. This will
bring onshore flow and cooler temperatures to the region. An upper
trough looks to take hold towards early next week with more cloud
cover and perhaps some light rain and/or drizzle returning.
Temperatures should be near to perhaps a touch below normal.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 455 AM PDT Tue Oct 17 2023

IFR-LIFR conditions for the North Bay terminals this morning, with
pockets of IFR around for the remainder of the Bay Area. Improving
to VFR all areas by 16-18Z. VFR continues through the TAF period
for all but the Monterey Bay terminals where BR/FG may redevelop
tonight after 06-08Z.

Vicinity of SFO...Currently VFR at the terminal but with IFR
clouds lurking in the vicinity. Can`t rule out at least transient
IFR clouds at the terminal over the next few hours and TEMPO is in
place for this potential with moderate confidence in ceiling
development. Otherwise outside of short-term concerns VFR
throughout the TAF period with breezy onshore winds this
afternoon.

SFO Bridge Approach...IFR clouds have developed in/near the
approach and should remain a concern through the morning hours.
VFR returns by late morning and should persist through the
remainder of the TAF period.

Monterey Bay Terminals...Currently VFR at the terminals. So far
sub-VFR conditions have failed to develop this morning. Confidence
has increased in prevailing VFR and previous TEMPOs have been
removed. That said can`t rule out transient low cloud/BR
development in the vicinity over the next few hours. Otherwise VFR
into at least early this evening. Low to medium confidence in
FG/BR development late tonight into Wednesday morning with sub-VFR
conditions possible at the terminals.

.MARINE...
(Today through Sunday)
Issued at 324 AM PDT Tue Oct 17 2023

Fresh to strong breezes will continue into tomorrow with near-gale
force gusts possible. Northwest swell at 15-16 seconds will
gradually diminish today before another long period northwest
swell arrives tomorrow. This will bring elevated seas and
hazardous conditions for small craft operators. High surf and
sneaker waves will also be a concern for beachgoers and on
Wednesday into Friday. A Beach Hazards statement is in effect for
these concerns early Wednesday morning through Friday.

&&

.BEACHES...
Issued at 324 AM PDT Tue Oct 17 2023

A long period northwest swell will arrive for mid to late week.
This will bring hazardous conditions for beachgoers in the form of
sneaker waves and large surf. An enhanced risk for rip currents
will also exist. Conditions will deteriorate on Wednesday with the
peak of the wave activity arriving on Thursday. High surf will
persist into Friday before subsiding. Use extreme caution and
remain out of the water to avoid hazardous swimming conditions.
Remember to never turn your back on the ocean.
