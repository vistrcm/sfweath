.SHORT TERM...
Issued at 210 AM PDT Thu Aug 7 2025
(Today and tonight)

No major changes from the last discussion. Broad troughing sits over
the majority of the West Coast this morning, with the closed low
swinging into the PacNW today. To our east, the upper level ridge
over the Four Corners will continue to flatten. Temperatures for
interior locations today may climb a couple degrees higher while
most locations will be similar to yesterday. As noted before, could
still see some haze/smoke nudge into interior San Benito from the
Gifford Fire to the south on Thursday.

.LONG TERM...
Issued at 210 AM PDT Thu Aug 7 2025
(Friday through Wednesday)

Upper level troughing slides to the east late Thursday into Friday,
as the eastern Pacific high builds into the region. This will hold
through the weekend and into early next week. The only real change
noted in the forecast period is that the warmer weather looks to
hold through Monday. Patches of Moderate HeatRisk are expected
for portions of the East, South, and North Bay while Minor
HeatRisk is expected elsewhere. For those who have to work in or
are looking to enjoy the outdoors, be sure to practice heat
safety. Wear sunscreen, take breaks, hydrate, and look before you
lock your vehicle.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 516 AM PDT Thu Aug 7 2025

Confidence is low to moderate in timing of stratus arrival this
morning. The Fort Ord profiler shows the marine layer is compressed
to around 800 feet with stratus intrusions mainly limited to the
coast as of the writing of the 12Z TAFs. Continued to lean towards
at least patchy stratus filtering into the SF Bay and impacting SFO,
OAK, and APC through 16Z. Low confidence that stratus will reach STS
with low confidence in fog development due to the presence of high
clouds overnight. For HAF, MRY, and SNS the more compressed marine
layer may lead to temporary drops in visibility with some potential
for fog to develop. This is most likely for HAF and MRY with other
coastal sites (WVI, OAR) reporting visibilities of
