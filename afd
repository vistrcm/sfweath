...New UPDATE...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 1239 AM PDT Thu Apr 24 2025

Cooler trend continues today into the weekend. Patchy drizzle and
fog are possible within the marine layer clouds. Light rain,
drizzle, and isolated thunderstorms are possible throughout the
region Friday and Saturday.

.UPDATE...
Issued at 945 AM PDT Thu Apr 24 2025

The short term forecast is in good shape with little to no changes
needed. The marine layer remains entrenched across the region with
widespread low stratus. Interestingly enough, mist/fog has been
largely confined to the coast. Similar conditions are anticipated
Friday, with an increasing probability of rain activity this
weekend. We`ll have more details on that this afternoon.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 1239 AM PDT Thu Apr 24 2025

Marine layer stratus has developed across the Bay Area and Central
Coast. The latest data from the Point Sur profiler suggests that the
marine layer has thickened to around 2500-3000 feet, a depth that
would support stratus intrusion well into the interior. Some of the
far interior locations could see some transitory sunshine for a few
hours in the afternoon, but the coastal region and the coastal
valleys should remain socked in through the day.

A cooling trend continues across the region with a strengthening
upper level trough approaching California. High temperatures range
from the lower to middle 60s in the inland valleys, with southern
Monterey County seeing temperatures up to the lower 70s, while the
coasts and the bays see temperatures reach the middle 50s to the
lower 60s. Onshore winds this afternoon will be breezy and gusty,
with gusts of 20-30 mph at the coast and through the gaps and
passes. In some favored regions, particularly Altamont Pass, Pacheco
Pass, and the Mayacamas, the gusty winds could last well into the
evening.

.LONG TERM...
(Friday through Wednesday)
Issued at 1239 AM PDT Thu Apr 24 2025

An upper level low should impact the state on Friday and Saturday,
with the trends for a stronger and more southerly low continuing as
of the latest model outputs. The ensemble model clusters are finally
coming into agreement on the location of the low coming in, if not
the exact strength. As a result, while we`re more confident in where
the rain will fall, there`s still some variation in the exact rain
amount. The current forecast calls for around 0.10-0.25" of rain in
the Monterey Bay region, the Santa Cruz Mountains, and the Salinas
Valley, with rainfall totals as high as 0.5-0.7" in the Santa Lucia
mountains. Elsewhere, rain totals across the Bay Area will be very
light, especially across the North Bay where upper level offshore
flow will limit the precipitation chances, and outside of the
southern and eastern mountains of Santa Clara County, wetting rains
(over 0.1" of rain) are not likely.

We`re also noting an steady increase in the likelihood of
convection across the region. While still slight, the
probabilities of thunderstorms have risen to 10-20%, mainly across
the Central Coast, extending from Friday night through Saturday.
From the previous forecaster: Forecast soundings show a few
hundred J/kg of CAPE across the Central Coast overnight Friday
into Saturday with forecasted CAPE values to peak Saturday
morning. To have a thunderstorm you need four main ingredients:
moisture, instability, lift, and wind shear (speed or
directional). With this system incoming, we have a source of
moisture, a source of lift (cold frontal passage), and some
instability forecast. The questionable ingredient is wind shear.
As of right now during the time of the highest thunderstorm
probabilities (5AM-5PM Saturday), forecast soundings show some
directional wind shear (winds veering with height indicating some
warm air advection is occurring) but not very much speed wind
shear. The surface to 500 mb bulk shear shows much higher speed
shear values located just to our south in San Luis Obispo County
(NWS Los Angeles` CWA). While the current trend for this cut-off
low has been to shift southwards, if the low were to shift just
slightly northward we could potentially see those higher bulk
speed shear values shift into Monterey County. If this were to
occur, it would increase confidence that we may see some
thunderstorms across southern Monterey County given the alignment
of wind shear with our area of moisture, lift, and instability.
It`s worth watching over the next few days to see where this cut-
off low tracks (further south or further north) and how our
thunderstorm risk along the Central Coast changes this weekend.

Ridging should return after the trough moves out, with daytime highs
rebounding to near to slightly above the seasonal averages in the
early and middle part of next week.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 448 AM PDT Thu Apr 24 2025

Widespread MVFR CIGS are affecting the region with IFR CIGs for STS.
Winds stay light to moderate through the morning and increase
slightly into the afternoon. Cloud cover snuggles to erode in the
late morning and into the afternoon, with CIGs scattering in most
areas, but mid level clouds continue to build. MVFR CIGs become
widespread into Thursday evening, with slight reductions in wind.
The next approaching rain system will cause some coastal drizzle and
some shower chances into early Friday.

Vicinity of SFO...MVFR CIGS rise into the afternoon to around 2300
ft AGL before scattering into the late afternoon but mid-level cloud
cover remains. MVFR CIGS return into the evening and last through
much of Friday before some slight lifting as the low pressure system
and light rain chances approach. Expect moderate west winds through
the TAF period.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO

Monterey Bay Terminals...MVFR CIGs last through the late morning
before scattering. West winds increase into the afternoon but reduce
in the early evening and MVFR CIGs re-fill over the terminals.

.MARINE...
(Today through Tuesday)
Issued at 945 AM PDT Thu Apr 24 2025

Expect quiet weather for the rest of today with some light rain
moving across the waters starting Friday morning and lingering
into that night. Strong northwesterly breezes and rough seas
return late Saturday.
