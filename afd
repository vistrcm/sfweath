...New AVIATION, MARINE...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 312 AM PDT Sat Oct 26 2024

Seasonal to warm temperatures continue Saturday before much
cooler, fall like temperatures return Sunday. An approaching low
pressure system will bring light rain to the Bay Area on Sunday
and result in cool, humid, and windy conditions through next week.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 312 AM PDT Sat Oct 26 2024

For the past few days temperatures have been leaning above average
across the Bay Area, however, that all stands to change this weekend
as an upper level low moves inland. Today will be the warmest day
through at least next weekend with temperatures remaining fairly
seasonal in the 60s along the coast and 70s across the interior. The
NBM deterministic forecast continues to trend on the warmer side
(highs in the upper 70s to low 80s inland) in comparison to other
models which trended towards highs in the low to upper 70s across
the interior. Given this, for high temperatures on Saturday we
leaned more towards the solutions supported by the HRRR and WRF
which pulled max temperatures down by a few degrees. Today is a good
day to get any last "changing of the season" chores done as we look
forward to our first real taste of fall on Sunday.

By Saturday night, overcast conditions will return as the marine
layer deepens and spreads inland ahead of the approaching low
pressure system. This cloud cover will help to keep overnight
temperatures Saturday into Sunday slightly higher than they are this
morning. This increased cloud cover will act as a sort of
"insulation" and prevent increased radiational cooling from
occurring (aka trapping more heat at the surface). Low
temperatures Saturday morning will be in the 40s to low 50s across
the region, comparatively, low temperatures Sunday morning will
be around 5 to 8 degrees warmer (widespread mid to upper 50s). For
those interested in how our rain chances are shaping up, let`s
head to the long term discussion.

(Sunday through Friday)
Issued at 312 AM PDT Sat Oct 26 2024

Now for the main attraction, an upper level low will move into the
West Coast beginning Sunday and bring with it elevated rain chances
to portions of the Bay Area. The overall forecast remains generally
the same as earlier, with the highest probability of rain exceeding
0.1" in the North Bay and some potential for light drizzle
(generally less than 0.1") across coastal portions of the Bay Area.
Probabilistic guidance shows a 42% chance of exceeding 0.1" in Santa
Rosa while farther north, near Cloverdale and Sea Ranch, there is
a 60 to 70% chance of exceeding 0.1" of rain on Sunday.
Comparatively, the likelihood of exceeding 0.1" of rain drops to
between 5 to 20% in the East Bay and South Bay as rain chances
decrease moving southward. Looking at QPF cluster analysis shows
most models in agreement with the idea that the highest likelihood
of rain will be in the North Bay. However, it is worth noting
that clusters weighted more heavily towards the GFS suggest at
least some rain (still less than 0.1") could extend into portions
of the South Bay and East Bay. While any rain that does extend
into the San Francisco Peninsula, East Bay, and South Bay will be
light it will still be the wettest day that most areas will have
seen since last spring.

Sunday marks the beginning of our pattern shift with high
temperatures running on average 3 to 5 degrees below normal but a
few sites may be running closer to 5 to 10 degrees below normal.
High temperatures generally look to be in the 60s to low 70s (in the
warmest spots) across the interior next week while closer to the
coast temperatures will be in the upper 50s to low 60s. The caveat
to this forecast is that the NBM has been running warm as the model
is being more heavily weighted to favor warmer temperatures due to
our recent heatwave (early October). The NBM tenth percentile shows
high temperatures slightly cooler in the mid to upper 60s across the
interior next week which is a scenario worth keeping in mind given
the recent NBM warm bias. Gusty winds look likely to develop in the
wake of this low pressure system along the coast, across valleys,
and across mountain gaps/passes through midweek. Both the GFS and
ECMWF keep the pattern fairly active with another weak system moving
through late next week. This system looks to increase precipitation
chances again, but, the setup looks similar to this weekend where
the highest precipitation chances will be in the North Bay and
lower elsewhere.

(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 431 AM PDT Sat Oct 26 2024

VFR is expected to prevail through the forecast period, even as
the marine layer gradually build through the forecast period. A
steady fetch of mid/high level cloud cover from a slow moving Hurricane
Kristy will limit low stratus coverage over the terminals.

Vicinity of SFO...Light and variable winds this morning will
become gusty at times this afternoon, then ease after sunset.
Low marine stratus will hover in vicinity of SFO but struggle to
organize inland as mid/high level clouds stream overhead through
much of the forecast period.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...Low marine stratus that had filled in to
the Salinas Valley late last night was eventually eroded by
mid/level clouds originating from Hurricane Kristy after midnight.
Expect VFR to prevail through the forecast period.

.MARINE...
(Today through Thursday)
Issued at 431 AM PDT Sat Oct 26 2024

Moderate to breezy winds continue through the weekend along
with moderate wave heights before an upper trough moves onshore
across the Pacific Northwest during the day on Sunday. Wave
heights will increase further in response to gusty northerly winds
building into the area. Expect significant wave heights of 10-12
feet to develop over the outer waters by Monday, creating
hazardous conditions for small craft vessels.

.MTR WATCHES/WARNINGS/ADVISORIES...
CA...None.
PZ...Small Craft Advisory from 9 PM Sunday to 9 AM PDT Monday for
     Pigeon Pt to Pt Pinos 10-60 NM-Pt Arena to Pt Reyes 0-10 nm.

     Small Craft Advisory from 3 PM Sunday to 9 AM PDT Monday for Pt
     Arena to Pt Reyes 10-60 NM.
