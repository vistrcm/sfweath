...New AVIATION...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 320 AM PDT Mon May 15 2023

Coastal clouds and inland sunshine are expected today. Mid week
warming is anticipated with above normal temperatures returning
for inland areas. Slight cooling by late week with no meaningful
rain on the horizon.

&&

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 349 AM PDT Mon May 15 2023

Overnight satellite imagery shows a summer-esque marine stratus
layer. Stratus currently covers the coastal waters and extends
across all inland valleys. Profilers put the depth the marine
layer 2,500 to 3,000 feet. The deeper marine layer has also led to
less dense fog this morning. However, some patchy fog and/or
drizzle will be possible. Needless to say, it will take some time
this morning for clouds to dissipate and erode back to the coast.
Despite the cloudy start do expected inland sunshine by this
afternoon. Max temperatures will be at or above seasonal averages
most areas. Highs will be in the upper 50s to near 70 at the
coast/bays and 70s to upper 80s inland.

&&

.LONG TERM...
(Tuesday through Sunday)
Issued at 349 AM PDT Mon May 15 2023

Relatively quiet weather is expected for the long term. High
pressure over the Desert SW will nudge toward Central CA through
mid week. The building high pressure will help to compress, but
not eliminate the marine layer. Additionally 850mb temperatures
will creep back to the upper teens(C). As a result, temperatures
will gradually warm with the hottest days being Tuesday and
Wednesday. Impact will be interior temperatures reaching the mid
80s to lower 90s, which will elevate Heat Risk back to Moderate.
Thereafter, the weak upper level low currently off the SoCal Coast
drifts farther south while a much deeper upper low currently off
PacNW Coast moves eastward. The weakening upper ridge and
approaching upper low will bring subtle cooling the second half
of the work week and into next week. Still watching possible
monsoon intrusion this week, but guidance continues to keep it
well to the east.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 439 AM PDT Mon May 15 2023

Current satellite showing most of the region under stratus this
morning, with a few pockets of clear skies further inland and in
the higher terrain above the marine layer. Terminals expected to
remain socked in through this morning with a well defined marine
layer at around 1500 ft. Clearing slightly later further south
with MVFR-IFR cigs holding on until late morning to midday, but
all in all would expect mixing out by mid-morning for most
elsewhere. Winds become breezy onshore this afternoon, generally
10-15 kts at most. Expect a return of stratus tonight, but lower
confidence on timing as some interaction with mid-to-high clouds
later in the day may affect development.

Vicinity of SFO...Current satellite showing the vicinity of SFO
completely covered by stratus, despite obs showing SCT conditions.
Went ahead and kept BKN prevailing in the TAF based on satellite
and nearby visual obs. Expect clouds to mix out by about the 17Z
hour, with a slight chance of some gradual clearing occuring in
the hours prior. Breezy afternoon with onshore flow 10-15 kts.
Return of stratus tonight expected, but may be hindered by some
interaction with mid-high clouds.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...IFR cigs through this morning with patchy
BR before sunrise. Stratus expected to remain until midday,
especially near the coast. Breezy onshore flow 8-12 kts this
afternoon. A well defined marine layer will help keep low clouds
around the coastal region throughout most of the day, with a
return of IFR cigs at terminals expected by this evening.

.MARINE...
(Today through Saturday)
Issued at 320 AM PDT Mon May 15 2023

Light southerly winds prevail through Monday, shifting to more
northwesterly Monday night into Tuesday. Winds expected to become
gusty near coastal jet regions Tuesday through the middle of the
week. Northwest swell continues through the week with a weak
southerly swell in the background.
