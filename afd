...New UPDATE, MARINE...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 315 AM PDT Sat Sep 21 2024

Gradual warming continues this afternoon, though todays highs will
still be at or slightly below normal for most locations across our
area. The potential for moderate HeatRisk Monday and Tuesday remains
in the forecast.

.UPDATE...
Issued at 845 AM PDT Sat Sep 21 2024

Stratus extends across most of the region`s valleys, mixing out
through the morning inland with patchy clouds remaining at the
immediate coast. Latest observations from the Fort Ord profiler
suggest that the marine layer is gradually compressing as high
pressure builds over the region, with the last report suggesting
a marine layer around 1600 feet. A warming trend is still expected
through the day, but the 24 hour trends are lagging behind. Not
enough confidence to update the forecast at this time, but will
continue to monitor the trends through the afternoon to see if we
need to bump down temperatures for the second day in a row.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 315 AM PDT Sat Sep 21 2024

High pressure expanding across our area today and tomorrow will
result in quiet weather with gradual warming today and tomorrow.
Marine boundary layer (re: Ft Ord profiler) was steady at around 2k
ft yesterday, with similar low level onshore flow persisting today.
Low level stratus will clear farther inland by mid morning over the
Bay Area and late morning around gaps and valleys around Monterey
Bay. Some low stratus will linger over coastal communities this
afternoon, but will see more of a mix of sun and clouds than what
was realized on Friday. This will help temps near the coastline get
in on the gradual warming that will occur farther inland. Tomorrow
will be similar, just a few degrees warmer as H50 heights continue
to slightly increase.

&&

.LONG TERM...
(Sunday through Friday)
Issued at 315 AM PDT Sat Sep 21 2024

A weak upper level low begins to develop over the California Central
Coast tomorrow interrupting the expanding area of high pressure to
our west over open water. Deterministic guidance is in a little
better agreement with the evolution of the upper level disturbance
than in previous runs. The weak closed low wanders southward
Monday, lifting back to the north offshore of our area on Tuesday,
and then farther north to be absorbed by the Polar Jet on
Wednesday. The net result appears to be less impactful heat event
for Monday and Tuesday than previously thought, though moderate
HeatRisk remains a possibility for many interior locations for
both Monday and Tuesday. Persistent, offshore upper level
troughing for the second half of next week will help cool daytime
temps back to around seasonal averages for Wednesday and beyond.
