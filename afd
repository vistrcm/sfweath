...New AVIATION, MARINE...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 1254 PM PDT Sun Jun 2 2024

Cooler temperatures hang on through today with breezy daytime
winds and marine layer stratus overnight. Tuesday sees a dramatic
warmup with a Heat Advisory in effect for the inland areas through
Thursday. Temperatures will moderate towards the latter part of
the week.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 413 AM PDT Mon Jun 3 2024

Milder morning temperatures are occuring courtesy of a mix of low
clouds and incoming higher level clouds from the northwest, higher
dewpoint temperatures (measure of water vapor), areas of mixing
surface winds and the lower level temperature inversion (all
slowing nocturnal radiative cooling). Dewpoint temperatures are
mainly in the lower to mid 50s across the forecast area, in
contact with 50F-54F sea surface temperatures helping to form
coastal fog and drizzle. Higher water vapor also extends into the
vertical, precipitable water (pw) on last evening`s Oakland upper
air sounding was 1.19" which is near the long term max moving
average in early June. The GFS has been forecasting the pw to
peak near 1.40" by late this morning, not far from a couple daily
maximums ~ 1.50"-1.55" on the period of record (since 1948) in
early to mid June.

With 500 mb heights mainly at or slightly greater than 580
decameters (about typical for June) there isn`t enough broad based
cooling e.g. positive vorticity to largely precipitate out the
increased water vapor at our latitude (like it certainly could in
winter season), rather like Sunday morning on the coastline, the
higher levels of water vapor may still produce either patchy
coastal drizzle or very light rain, add in a surface based cool
front forecast to arrive later today and this too may help further
produce light measurable precipitation, best chances on the
coastline.

A fair amount of clouds are rolling in, the best chance of sunny
breaks today will be inland and during the afternoon. Daytime
highs will be about the same today compared to Sunday except cooler
farther inland, i.e. due to increasing cloud cover and post frontal
cool air advection later today. Some coastal stratus is likely to
roll back in this evening, lower level winds also shifting to north
to northeasterly direction starting late tonight.

.LONG TERM...
(Tuesday through Sunday)
Issued at 413 AM PDT Mon Jun 3 2024

Model forecasts are consistently showing a steepening ACV-SFO
pressure gradient, increasing 925 mb and 850 mb temperatures and
steadily climbing 500 mb heights Tuesday, all indicating higher
pressure moving in and warmer to hotter temperatures soon to
develop over the forecast area. Lower to mid level tropospheric
temperatures will increase under compressional warming, readings
nearing the max moving average for early June, 500 mb heights
(peaking near 590 decameters) will be between the 90th percentile
and the max moving average in early June. As we have been
advertising, it`ll turn warm to hot fairly quickly especially
inland. A heat advisory remains in effect Tuesday-Thursday. The
marine layer will become compressed, likely to 1000 feet or less,
preventing inland areas from receiving afternoon & evening sea
breeze relief. Midweek timeframe by midday Wednesday is when the
apex of 500 mb heights will pass east of our forecast area, the
center of the high continuing to shift eastward reaching NM/TX
late week before becoming approximately stationary; a strong zonal
jet stream across the Pacific and western CONUS likely helping to
at least initially move the ridge well inland at a quickened pace.

Have mentioned in a previous discussion current coastal sea surface
temperatures are in good shape, running 1F to 2F below June normals
and the PDO is in negative phase. This will help restore a sea
breeze, question is how quickly later on this week, plus pw values
are forecast to remain above normal even during mid to late week
which will eventually help restore coastal stratus & fog. To add,
more recent meso-scale and global model output have scaled back
the potential for a coastally trapped southerly wind reversal here
in our forecast area mid to late week. It still may happen, can`t
completely rule it out, but from a numerical weather prediction
aspect it currently looks less favorable. Rather a reinforcement
of surface high pressure over the coastal and offshore waters may
bring in cooler air, re-establishing an onshore SFO-SAC pressure
gradient while the ACV-SFO pressure gradient (northerly winds)
will have already decreased by late week.

Helpful life saving information/tips from previous discussion:

Moderate HeatRisk is expected for the inland North Bay, the East and
South Bays, and the inland Central Coast through Thursday, meaning
that there`s a moderate risk of heat-related illnesses for sensitive
populations (children, the elderly, pregnant women, those with
certain medical conditions, or anyone working outside without
cooling or hydration). In addition, we`re also starting to see major
HeatRisk in some areas of the North Bay valleys and far eastern
Contra Costa county on Tuesday, corresponding to a major risk of
heat-related illnesses to anyone without effective cooling, adequate
hydration, or both. Here are some heat safety tips:

* Stay hydrated and drink plenty of fluids.
* Wear lightweight, light-colored clothing.
* Reduce time spent outdoors or stay in the shade.
* Never leave people or pets unattended in vehicles.
* Use sunscreen if going to the coast or the pool.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 454 AM PDT Mon Jun 3 2024

Currently a mix of LIFR and IFR CIGs throughout the region as
stratus continues to push inland. Beyond sunrise, expecting most
CIGs to improve to at least MVFR conditions, though very late
clearing to VFR is expected for SF bay terminals in the afternoon,
as westerly winds will continue to feed stratus through the Golden
Gate and San Bruno gaps. Little to no clearing for Monterey Bay
expected. Moderate westerly winds return in the afternoon, though
gusts will likely be isolated to coastal terminals, reaching about
20-25 knots generally. Into the evening, as high pressure sets in,
and upper level winds turn to become northerly inducing directional
LLWS at select terminals, expecting stratus to slowly erode as the
lower levels dry out and are sapped of moisture. This should lead to
widespread VFR for most terminals north of Monterey Bay.


Vicinity of SFO...Currently IFR, expected to become LIFR briefly
this morning as the marine layer compresses. Through the morning,
CIGs will slowly rise to become MVFR towards noon. Late clearing of
stratus is expected in the afternoon, becoming VFR but with SCT low
clouds as winds increase and gust to around 30 knots out of the
west. Clouds are anticipated to continue to dissipate through the
end of the TAF period leading to widespread VFR. Winds ease into the
nighttime slowly.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...LIFR conditions persist through the
morning, but CIGs are expected to lift towards sunrise as diurnal
heating begins, eventually achieving MVFR in the late afternoon.
Not expecting VFR to last long at KMRY, in fact, low confidence in
clearing whatsoever. Therefore, have included a TEMPO for brief and
intermittent VFR conditions in the afternoon. Winds breezy and
westerly in the afternoon today should help maintain the stratus
feed. IFR CIGs return in the nighttime.

.MARINE...
(Today through Saturday)
Issued at 454 AM PDT Mon Jun 3 2024

Moderate to fresh NW winds persist through the midweek, but
increase to become strong towards Wednesday with gale force gusts
possible in the northern waters. Moderate wave heights will
persist before rough seas build towards the mid-week with
significant wave heights of 10-12 feet expected.
