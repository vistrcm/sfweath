...New UPDATE, MARINE...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 239 AM PDT Sat Aug 24 2024

A progressive pattern continues over the next week bringing light
rain chances today. Temperatures rebound by the beginning of next
week before the next trough moves into the Northwest by the middle
of next week.

&&

.UPDATE...
Issued at 919 AM PDT Sat Aug 24 2024

Current radar showing some more pronounced showers moving into the
Bay Area as of the 9AM hour. Have seen some brief enhancement of
showers leading to very localized moderate-to-heavy rain, but no
lightning yet as of writing. 12Z sounding from OAK shows some
hints of instability, which will aid in this localized enhancement
through this morning. Not seeing much in the way of ice in-cloud,
nor the vigorous updrafts needed for charge separation, so
lightning chance remains low...though can`t rule out a strike or
two with the heaviest showers this morning. Good news is that we
have a deep moist column this morning, so any lightning that
occurs would likely do so accompanied by wetting rain.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 254 AM PDT Sat Aug 24 2024

Widely scattered light showers are seen on KMUX radar, a few
sprinkles from high based clouds are noted as far south as
northern Monterey County. Light measurable precipitation has been
along northernmost Sonoma County with rain gauges showing 0.02" to
0.15" so far. Also seeing more recently 0.01" to 0.02" light rain
over Marin County. Not yet seeing rain gauge tips farther south,
as mentioned just a few traces in sprinkles so far. August is our
2nd driest month of the year, with even the typically wettest
spots in the North Bay normally not getting more than a few
hundredths of an inch in August, most times August is dry under
upper level high pressure.

Shower development through morning remains favorable mainly
across the North Bay, but there may be some additional southward
reach of light measurable rain today. There`s a dynamically cooled
pool of air aloft within the low which includes the low having
drawn in precipitable water between 1" and 1.1" which is near the
90th percentile in late August. There remains good cyclonic
curvature in the 500 mb heights and similarly in the upper level
jet stream which favors divergence. The strong 558 decameter low
center (for late August) will soon near Crescent City, the low is
forecast to continue on a southeastward trajectory through today;
recent model output have slowed the forward motion of the low a
little. The 500 mb low passes across the Sierra Nevada crest much
later today between early and mid evening.

.LONG TERM...
(Sunday through Friday)
Issued at 254 AM PDT Sat Aug 24 2024

For Sunday the low will have moved well eastward and 500 mb
heights will return to 580+ decameters Sunday and 590 decameters
Monday. Oakland upper air late August climatology shows 500 mb
heights are typically near 585 decameters. Temperatures will warm
up beginning early in the week with additional warming potential
through mid-week. There may also be some flattening of the 500 mb
ridge during mid-week while another 500 mb shortwave trough over
Alaska moves toward and across the Pacific Northwest. Recent global
model output have trended 2 to 3 Celsius lower in 850 mb temps
(similarly at the 925 mb level) over our forecast area during that
time.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 434 AM PDT Sat Aug 24 2024

Deep troughing continues to dominate the pattern. Scattered
showers will taper off through the morning. While every station
has a ceiling, the bases are generally over 3,000 ft. There are
exceptions as some of the showers pass and temporary MVFR or even
IFR conditions in the North Bay are possible for the next 6 hours
or so. The showers are generally only producing light rain, but a
brief heavier shower or two have been observed early this morning.
As the rain tapers off, the ceilings will gradually lift with
mostly cirrus remaining in the afternoon. As usual, onshore winds
will increase to a moderate breeze in the afternoon.

Vicinity of SFO...Ceilings are hovering right around 3,000 ft,
and there have been some decent showers move through both SFO and
OAK this morning. The current radar loop shows that there will be
a break for at least next couple hours, and it`s likely that the
showers have ended for the day. The overall trend through the
morning will be for lifting ceilings, but with several low cloud
layers being reported, that trend may not be perfectly linear.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...Surprisingly it looks like MRY and SNS
are going to remain VFR this morning with ceilings above 10,000
ft. There is some indication that these will drop as low as 5,000
ft over the next few hours, but the guidance has been far too
aggressive for these two stations lately and the TAFs reject that
possibility. By late morning, the mid-level clouds should clear.
There is a good chance MVFR stratus will form over the coastal
waters by midnight, but only a 50% chance it makes it to the
terminals as the marine layer tries to get organized.

.MARINE...
(Today through Thursday)
Issued at 919 AM PDT Sat Aug 24 2024

Gentle to moderate northwest winds continue through the weekend.
Stronger gusty winds will occur near the Big Sur Coast and within
the San Francisco and Monterey Bays where small craft advisories
have been issued for the afternoon- evening timeframe on both
Saturday and Sunday. Rough seas are in store by the middle of next
week in the northern waters, before long period southerly swell
arrives from distant hurricanes late next week.

.MTR WATCHES/WARNINGS/ADVISORIES...

PZ...Small Craft Advisory from 3 PM this afternoon to 9 PM PDT this
     evening for Mry Bay-Pigeon Pt to Pt Pinos 0-10 nm-Pt Pinos

     Small Craft Advisory from 3 PM to 9 PM PDT Sunday for Mry Bay-
