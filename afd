...New AVIATION...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 245 AM PDT Mon Jun 19 2023

A broad upper level trough over the West will keep cool and breezy
conditions over the region through mid-week. Low stratus will
return later this morning with patchy fog and drizzle.

&&

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 259 AM PDT Mon Jun 19 2023

Overnight satellite fog product shows what a difference 24 hours
makes. A dry cold front swept through the region on Sunday leading
to colder air aloft, windier conditions at the surface, and a
much more mixed lower boundary layer. As a result, only patchy
stratus is seen on satellite with clouds near Pt Reyes, San Mateo
coast, N Salinas Valley, and East Bay Valleys. Some stout winds
were recorded on Sunday with gusts over 50 mph. The breezy to
gusty conditions remain tonight as well. Highest gusts since
midnight range from 40-50 mph with a few nearing 60 mph in the
East Bay passes, like Altamont Pass.

For today - as noted on previous discussions the airmass behind
the cold front is much colder. Projected 850 mb temperatures today
will be in the 5-6 deg C range. Based on Oakland sounding climo
this would be a daily min record and below the lowest 10% of obs
for 850 mb temps. In other words, a seasonably cooler day across
the Bay Area and Central Coast with highs in the upper 50s to
lower 70s (5 to 15 deg colder than Sunday). Not cold enough to set
any record low maximum temps, but close. The breezy to gusty
onshore flow will persist. Once again, borderline for a Wind
Advisory in the East Bay Hills, but localized gusts over 50 mph
will be possible (think Altamont/Pacheco Passes).

For tonight - winds will ease helping to set the stage for a
chilly night. Some patchy stratus will be possible, but mostly
clear skies will prevail with the cold airmass overhead. As such,
lows will dip in the lower and mid 40s interior and upper 40s to
lower 50s coast/bays

.LONG TERM...
(Tuesday through Sunday)
Issued at 328 AM PDT Mon Jun 19 2023

Cool weather regime remains locked in over the region for the long
term. The broad upper trough currently overhead is still on track
to evolve into a cut-off upper low by Thursday/Friday. Less clouds
, but breezy and cool will be rule through midweek. By Thursday an
upper low is forecast to develop overhead. Expect this upper level
feature to bring the marine layer back (night/morning low clouds)
with possibly drizzle. The upper low will finally eject eastward
by Friday with zonal flow developing behind it. A gradual warming
trend is expected Friday into next weekend, but still below normal
for late June.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 446 AM PDT Mon Jun 19 2023

Patchy low clouds this morning, mainly developing in the hills
under very strong onshore/upslope flow. Brief cigs possible over
the terminals early this morning but no long duration cigs
forecast. Main short term concern will be gusty nw sfc winds and
llws at area terminals.

Vicinity of SFO...Latest obs show BKN020 at terminal but given the
lack of marine inversion layer no long duration cigs forecast this
morning. Gusty NW wind to 34 kt through the day.

SFO Bridge Approach...Cigs not forecast over the bridge approach
so expecting pilots to have visuals below the 2000 foot decks at
SFO. NW winds 10-20 kt at the bridge.

Monterey Bay Terminals...Persistent and strong nw flow in the
boundary layer will keep sct-bkn020 cloud decks in the hills near
kmry and ksns trending few-sct020 after 17z.

.MARINE...
(Today through Saturday)
Issued at 245 AM PDT Mon Jun 19 2023

An unseasonably deep upper low and dry surface cold front will
continue to generate gusty northwest winds with occasional gale
force gusts over the coastal waters at least through Tuesday.
These strong winds will filter into San Francisco and Monterey Bay
during the afternoon and evening hours of Monday and Tuesday.
Breezy northwest winds will continue Wednesday through Friday with
low pressure along the West Coast.
