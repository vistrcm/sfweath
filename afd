...New UPDATE, MARINE...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 214 AM PST Tue Dec 31 2024

Dry for much of the service area until the Friday. The exception
will be for the North Bay counties where light rain may clip them on
Wednesday.

&&

.UPDATE...
Issued at 840 AM PST Tue Dec 31 2024

Mainly clear skies with some high clouds along the North bay coast
and the southern portion of Monterey County. This morning`s lows
did run a couple degrees above the forecast, mainly due to partly
to mostly cloudy skies overnight. The operations team will
evaluate the need for any further frost and freeze products with
the next forecast update.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 214 AM PST Tue Dec 31 2024

Mainly zonal upper level flow holds through the short term, with a
shortwave upper level trough moving into the PacNW tonight. This
will lead to dry weather for the period with increasing cloud cover
by the afternoon. Partly to mostly cloudy skies are expected
overnight, which could make low temperatures for New Year`s morning
might be a bit trickier to forecast. Given the cloud cover and above
freezing 850mb temps, opted to trend warmer than the NBM forecast.
Most areas should stick to the 40s, though valleys and higher
terrain could dip into the mid to upper 30s. Given the uncertainty
of the forecast, opted to hold off on any additional cold weather
products for the time being.

&&

.LONG TERM...
(Wednesday through Monday)
Issued at 214 AM PST Tue Dec 31 2024

The short wave trough scoots across the PacNW on Wednesday, which
may bring some light rain to the North Bay counties. Elsewhere, dry
conditions prevail. Ensemble and model guidance then show upper
level ridging building in and exiting the region by late Thursday. A
more robust upper level trough looks to move across the PacNW
Friday, which should spread light to moderate rain across the
region. Upper level ridging builds in the trough`s wake, though
another quick moving disturbance may slide across northern CA and
into NV on Sunday.
