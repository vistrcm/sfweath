.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 1228 AM PST Tue Dec 26 2023

Cloudy and generally dry for today with gradually strengthening
winds. First rain system arrives Wednesday focused on the North Bay,
before another system on Friday impacts the entire region. Active
pattern continues through the first week of the New Year.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 1228 AM PST Tue Dec 26 2023

KMUX and Eureka radars are showing some scattered showers across the
coast of northern California. Rainfall totals are not very
impressive, with the most rainfall seen across the region being a
few hundredths of an inch of rain. Thus the forecast for tonight
into the daytime hours continues to lean towards a generally dry if
cloudy day, with morning lows in the upper 30s to low 40s in the
interior valleys to the mid to upper 40s near the coast. High
temperatures today will remain at around the upper 50s to mid 60s in
the lower elevations, to the low to mid 50s in the higher
elevations.

The upper level ridge over the Great Basin that has been dominating
our weather for the last few days is being "squeezed" by a north
Pacific low system. The ridge is expected to largely remain in
place, meaning that southerly winds start to strengthen through the
day. Then, rain starts to arrive in the North Bay later tonight into
Wednesday.

.LONG TERM...
(Wednesday through Monday)
Issued at 1228 AM PST Tue Dec 26 2023

Wednesday`s rain system will focus more on the North Bay, where
rainfall totals range from 0.5-1.5", with amounts up to 2-3" in the
North Bay mountains. Elsewhere, the coastal regions of the Bay Area
should see around 0.5-0.75" with up to 1-1.5" in the Santa Cruz
mountains, with the interior Bay Area generally seeing 0.2-0.5" of
rain. The Central Coast sees around 0.25-0.5" along the coast, with
up to 1" in Santa Cruz County and the Bug Sur coast, with less than
0.25" in the interior. Strong wind gusts will come through during
Wednesday, with the coastal regions and ridgetops seeing gusts up to
40-45 miles per hour, and gusts of up to 20-30 miles per hour
elsewhere.

The arrival of a very strong westerly swell system on Thursday will
result in dangerous breaking waves of 20 to 26 feet, and as such, a
High Surf Warning has been issued through the day on Thursday. This
is associated with another north Pacific low that will push out the
upper level ridge and impact the state. Significant rainfall will be
more widespread in the region as a result, especially in the Bay
Area and Central Coast. As of now, from late Thursday into late
Saturday, 1-3" of rain is possible along the coastal ranges, with
widespread rain totals of 0.5-1.5" possible across the rest of the
forecast region. The forecast rain totals are still being refined,
and an active pattern continues into the first week of the new year.
Stay tuned for forecast updates, and make sure gutters and storm
drains are cleaned of debris.

Through it all, high temperatures will remain in the upper 50s to
the mid 60s in the lower elevations, perhaps up into the upper 60s
for Thursday and Friday in the interior valleys, and the low to mid
50s in the higher elevations.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 407 AM PST Tue Dec 26 2023

VFR persists  for all but the North Bay, which will see reduced
visibility this morning from fog, then MVFR Wednesday morning as the
next front nears the area. Winds stay mostly light to moderate
through the day with stronger southerly winds expected Wednesday
morning ahead of the next front. Beyond the TAF period, showers
and widespread lowered CIGs develop along the cold front.


Vicinity of SFO...VFR through the TAF period with passing high
clouds. Winds look to remain light through Wednesday morning.
Stronger and gusty southerly winds build into late Wednesday morning.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO

Monterey Bay Terminals...VFR through the TAF Period. Winds look to
stay light at MRY but SNS sees more moderate westerly this afternoon
and into the late evening before becoming light again.

&&

.MARINE...
(Today through Sunday)
Issued at 407 AM PST Tue Dec 26 2023

Hazardous swell continues through the day. An oncoming front will
introduce strong southerly winds that will reach gale force in
the mid week. The front will also offer chances for rain and be
followed by a large westerly swell. Winds and swell reduce through
Thursday. Another front arrives this weekend, offering breezy
winds and increased westerly swell.

&&

.BEACHES...
Issued at 407 AM PST Tue Dec 26 2023

A High Surf Warning will go in effect Thursday at 3 AM PST through
3 AM PST Friday. Expect hazardous wave conditions with breaking
waves 20 to 26 feet and localized beach erosion. Large waves can
sweep across the beach without warning, pulling people into the
sea from rocks, jetties and beaches. These large waves can be
erratic and unpredictable. The larger swings of the tidal cycle
will contribute to the beach risks.

Remain out of the water during the High Surf to avoid hazardous
swimming conditions. Use extra caution near the surf zone as
these large waves will be capable of sweeping people into the
water. Avoid rocks and jetties. Avoid steep beaches. Stay much
farther back from the water and never turn your back on the ocean.
