.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 327 AM PST Thu Nov 9 2023

Mild and tranquil weather conditions persist with a gradual
warming trend into the weekended. Other than a slight chance for
rain in the North Bay tonight, dry weather persists. Increasing
confidence the region will see its first widespread rainfall
event next week.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 352 AM PST Thu Nov 9 2023

Except for a few patches of low clouds and/or fog along the inner
coastal waters, it`s clear and dry. Most valleys and low lying
areas are cooler to colder than this time early Wednesday morning.
In the southern Salinas Valley air temperatures are lowering
quickly, therefore decided to issue a Frost Advisory there until 9
am today. Heat radiated out to space prior to sunrise may result
in a few additional patches of frost in the valleys and low lying
areas elsewhere for example the North Bay valleys, the East Bay
valleys, easternmost Santa Clara County and maybe in the Santa
Cruz Mountains. The Wednesday evening 00z Oakland upper air
sounding precipitable water was 0.27", the driest it`s been this
week and not far from the min moving average for early November
climatology; less water vapor allows more heat to radiate to space
at night, like in the desert. Offshore pressure gradients WMC-SFO
and ACV-SFO are 6.9 mb and 1.6 mb respectively, the SFO-SAC gradient
is near neutral. Expect sunny conditions to start the day, with
eventually increasing clouds in the mix, temperatures warming to
the 60s to lower 70s.

It`ll be partly to mostly cloudy tonight, a weakening trough of
low pressure approaching from the northwest will bring a few
sprinkles or light showers, best chances across the North Bay;
any measurable precipitation tonight will be minimal. The offshore
pressure gradients are also forecast to diminish tonight.

.LONG TERM...
(Friday through Wednesday)
Issued at 352 AM PST Thu Nov 9 2023

Dry weather through the weekend with slightly warming daytime
high temperatures, highs warmest Sunday ranging from the upper 60s
to the 70s. Somewhat cooler temperatures developing early next
week, not much different from the weekend temperatures, near
normal to slightly above mid November normals.

Near high confidence a long wave trough develops over the eastern
Pacific next week, strongest negative height anomalies centering
near 140W-160W per CPC 6-10 day prognostic outlooks, approx 1500
miles west of San Francisco. Along with this, recent global model
trends have been slowing the arrival of wet weather here in our
forecast area early next week to approx Tuesday even later Tuesday,
including more recent GFS output overnight slowing the rain
arrival to Wednesday night to early Thursday morning; large
differences in models, including the NBM, it`s low confidence in
timing. Model calculations continue to differ in locations where
surface lows are forecast to develop largely driven by a southward
directed polar jet stream digging the long wave trough with
atmospheric dynamics gradually focusing more offshore at least
initially next week. A narrow window of residence time next week
allows the developing low pressure system to entrain some
subtropical moisture and potentially bring heavier rain to our
forecast area mountains and hills, however there`s a southward
displacement in the heavier qpf also showing up that may be
associated with the polar and subtropical jet streams merging closer
to southern California. It`s a complex forecast, stay tuned, more
updates to be provided.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 400 AM PST Thu Nov 9 2023

VFR through the TAF period. The ridging pattern weakens, but will
prevent low cloud development. High clouds will filter into the
area later today as the next system approaches, but will not be
impactful. The pattern will also keep surface winds relatively
light, with only a few areas seeing moderate winds this afternoon,
before becoming weak again tonight.

Vicinity of SFO...VFR through the TAF period. Expect moderate
afternoon winds followed by light and variable winds overnight and
into the late morning Friday.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO

Monterey Bay Terminals...VFR through the TAF period. Winds stay
light and variable through the morning and into the afternoon
before moderate westerly winds return. Expect winds to weaken
again in the evening.

.MARINE...
(Tonight through next Monday)
Issued at 229 AM PST Thu Nov 9 2023

Breezy to gusty winds return this afternoon for the outer waters.
Another moderate period northwest swell train arrives toward the
end of the week ahead of a weak low pressure system. Increased
rain chances over marine areas starting late Friday into Saturday.
Stronger winds will return into the weekend. Winds turn southerly
early next week.

.MTR WATCHES/WARNINGS/ADVISORIES...
