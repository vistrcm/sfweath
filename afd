...New SHORT TERM, LONG TERM, AVIATION, MARINE...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 1259 PM PST Sat Jan 4 2025

A dry pattern is settling in with warmer temperatures and
offshore winds expected next week.

&&

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 339 AM PST Sun Jan 5 2025

High clouds continue to stream across our region overnight helping
to stunt radiational cooling, with overnight lows mostly a few
degrees above normal as we head toward sunrise. It`s going to be a
beautiful day across our area today with warmer temperatures, mainly
in the low to mid 60s, light winds and plenty of sunshine. A
relatively mild overnight into early Monday morning will set the
stage for an even nicer day on Monday across the Central Coast and
and adjacent inland valleys, where highs will climb into the
mid/upper 60s. The North Bay and Bay Area will see more cloud cover
on Monday as a developing `inside slider` system brings enough
mid/upper level clouds onshore to keep temperatures in the upper
50s/low 60s.

&&

.LONG TERM...
(Monday through Saturday)
Issued at 339 AM PST Sun Jan 5 2025

The extended forecast remains on track for the aforementioned
`inside slider` to bring warmer offshore flow setting in late Monday
night. The enhanced downsloping Diablo winds will result in gusty
winds spreading south across our entire area during the day Tuesday,
persisting through at least Wednesday morning. A wind advisory is
likely at some point in that window for higher elevations (>900ft),
more marginal for low lying inland locations and the coastal areas.
The SFO-WMC gradients remain impressive (GEFS 12-13mb, SREF 15mb
early Wednesday) as strong surface high pressure (~1040mb) builds
over northern Nevada in the wake of the upper low as it cuts off
from the Polar Jet Tuesday night. Temperatures Tuesday through the
remainder of the extended will be above normal with some daily
records possibly broken, with highs around or just above 70 inland,
cooler near the coast and at higher elevation.

&&

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 339 AM PST Sun Jan 5 2025

Mostly VFR through the period with some HZ and FG impacts early
this morning and again late tonight through Monday morning.
Otherwise winds relatively light and non-impactful.

Vicinity of SFO...VFR through Sunday with relatively light W/NW
winds. Some HZ impacts expected tonight as airmass stagnates. Low
confidence, but some potential for FG/BR early Monday morning with
IFR cigs through sunrise.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...VFR through the TAF period. Winds will be
mostly light and variable overnight, becoming more E/SE Sunday but
still light.

&&

.MARINE...
(Today through Friday)
Issued at 339 AM PST Sun Jan 5 2025

Seas ease today, with building northwesterly swell and gusty north
winds on Monday bringing a return of hazardous conditions for
small craft Monday evening through Wednesday morning with wave
heights between 11-12 feet.

&&

.BEACHES...
Issued at 938 PM PST Sat Jan 4 2025

High Surf continues due to breaking waves of 18-22 feet (all
coastal locations expect the northern Monterey Bay which will
remain in a Beach Hazard Statement).

Also at the current time, wave model forecasts are showing a newly
arriving long period westerly swell Monday into Tuesday. As always
whenever there is increasing surf - remember to never turn your back
on the ocean and stay out of the water. Again please stay tuned to any
further updates for late week, additionally for early next week.

&&
