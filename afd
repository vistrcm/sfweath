.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 238 AM PST Sat Nov 18 2023

It`s a radar watch shift as storms continue to develop in the marine
zones ahead of the next large band of rain. The strongest storms
remain well off the coast of Monterey Co, but will try to move
toward the coast in the early morning. Widespread showers are
affecting the North Bay with mostly moderate rainfall but a few
reports of locally higher rates. Short term models continue to
hint at the whole system slowing into the early morning, causing
some higher rainfall amounts for coastal areas. Showers and storms
spread across the CWA through the morning The main rain band
pushes east in the late afternoon into the evening, with spotty
showers and storms lingering into the late night.

.LONG TERM...
(Sunday through Friday)
Issued at 238 AM PST Sat Nov 18 2023

Rain chances exit early Sunday, bringing dry conditions back into
the forecast as a ridge builds. The shift in weather pattern will
make for breezy and gusty conditions through Sunday with
northerly winds hitting their peak late that night.

Winds settle as the ridge centers over the West Coast, Monday.
Expect a warming and drying trend through the mid week followed by a
modest cooling trend as the ridge collapses and allows for zonal
flow by the end of the week.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 319 AM PST Sat Nov 18 2023

A major rain band is coming through the North Bay and entering the
San Mateo Peninsula, carrying patches of MVFR/IFR conditions with
the most intense rain. Showers continue to develop on the mountains
of Monterey County, with a band of convective showers, some of which
have a history of producing lightning, lurking offshore. The band of
rain pushes through the region into the morning hours, with shower
activity continuing through the early evening hours. The
southeasterly flow pattern will shift to the southwest in the late
morning hours, then to the northwest in the late afternoon to the
evening, as a cold front brings one last chance for showers to the
region. Moderate confidence on flight categories for the rest of the
rain event, with generally MVFR ceilings expected, although the most
intense rain could result in IFR visibilities. In the post-frontal
environment tonight into Sunday, expect breezy and gusty northwest
winds.

Vicinity of SFO... MVFR conditions expected through the morning as
the main rain band comes through the terminal. Breezy and gusty
southeast flow shifts to the southeast later in the morning, then to
the west in the late afternoon/early evening hours. Showers continue
through the evening hours with northwest winds expected overnight
after a cold front passes. Beyond the TAF period, monitoring the
possibility for gusts up to 30 knots on Sunday.

SFO Bridge Approach... Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals... Widespread rain with MVFR ceilings
persists through the morning hours, showers continue into the
evening. Breezy and gusty southeast winds shift to the southwest in
the late morning, then to the northwest this evening and overnight.
Low confidence for IFR ceilings developing tonight, but current
model output shows winds aloft disrupting stratus development.

.MARINE...
(Today through Thursday)
Issued at 238 AM PST Sat Nov 18 2023

Showers and isolated thunderstorms continue to move over the
waters. With these thunderstorms, gusty and erratic winds,
lightning, and heavier rain are the main hazards. Winds will begin
to diminish into the afternoon before increasing again Sunday.
Low pressure will dissipate as it moves inland Saturday and rain
chances will diminish by Sunday morning. In addition,
southwesterly swell builds tonight into Saturday and a large
northwest swell train arrives Sunday.
