.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 1237 AM PST Tue Dec 10 2024

Chilly overnight temperatures continue with a Freeze Warning
currently in effect in the southern Salinas Valley and a Frost
Advisory for the inland Bay Area and Central Coast until 9 AM. Gusty
offshore winds across the higher elevations of the Bay Area continue
to diminish through the morning. Light rain is expected late
Wednesday into Thursday, mainly across the North Bay, with more
significant rainfall Friday and Saturday.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 1237 AM PST Tue Dec 10 2024

Key Messages:
- Cold temperatures expected through the morning.
- Freeze Warning for the southern Salinas Valley, and Frost Advisory
for the inland Bay Area and Central Coast, in effect through 9 AM.
- Offshore winds will diminish through the morning.
- Light rain expected late Wednesday and Thursday, mainly in the
North Bay.
- More significant rainfall expected Friday and Saturday.

The main story tonight will be the interaction between the clear
skies and dry conditions promoting substantial cooling tonight, and
the offshore winds that would inhibit it, at least for a few more
hours. As it stands, a Freeze Warning is in effect in the southern
Salinas Valley, and a Frost Advisory for the North Bay valleys,
interior East Bay, Santa Clara Valley, eastern Santa Clara Hills,
and the interior mountains of Monterey and San Benito Counties, both
until 9 AM today. However, the last few hours of observations have
shown the offshore winds that have buffeted the higher elevations of
the Bay Area today descending into some of the valleys. (Quick side
note: offshore winds bring warmer temperatures because they
generally come down either the Sierra Nevada range, or more
localized higher terrain, during which time they experience an
increase in air pressure as they come down into the Central Valley.
From the Ideal Gas Law, if the pressure of an air parcel increases,
its temperature must increase as well.) For example, at 9 PM the
Napa County Airport reported a temperature of 36 degrees with calm
winds. Two hours later, the airport reported 48 degree temperatures
and a east wind at 12 mph. Similar warming trends have been reported
in other stations across the region. However, the forecast also
shows those offshore winds calming down through the morning, and
where we do see winds remaining calm (or becoming calm again),
there`s really nothing stopping heat energy from radiating out into
space. There`s not quite enough confidence just yet to cancel any of
the Freeze or Frost products, but the operations team will continue
to monitor the winds through the morning and update products as
necessary.

Remember the Four P`s of Winter Weather:

People: Dress in layers and wear a hat that covers the ears. Pay
special attention to children and the elderly, who are more
vulnerable to the cold.
Plants: Bring potted plants indoors and keep outdoor plants and
trees protected.
Pets: Bring all pets indoors. Pets and other animals that have to be
kept outdoors should have an enclosed shelter.
Pipes: Make sure all external water pipes are insulated. Keep an
interior faucet running at a drip to prevent ice buildup.

In addition to the above, there`s also a chance that fog over the
Central Valley will come northward into the eastern reaches of
Contra Costa and Alameda counties and the Carquinez Strait, and a
potential for freezing fog to develop in the North Bay valleys
through the morning. If your morning commute does take you through a
foggy area, remember to allow extra time, drive slow, and use low
beam headlights.

High clouds will begin to build through the day. High temperatures
range from the middle to upper 60s in the valleys of the South Bay
and Central Coast, to the lower to middle 60s in the North Bay and
Bay Area valleys, and closer to the upper 50s to lower 60s near the
Pacific coast.

.LONG TERM...
(Wednesday through Monday)
Issued at 1237 AM PST Tue Dec 10 2024

The storm door is opening again with a series of rainmakers coming
through the region over the next week. First up is a shortwave
trough coming into the region Wednesday into Thursday. Over the last
couple of days, the probabilities for precipitation from this system
have shot up from "non-zero, but very low" to "likely to very likely
across the North Bay and the northern SF Bay Area". Even so, this is
going to be a light rain event. The higher elevations of the North
Bay will be lucky to receive half an inch of rain, with around a
quarter of an inch expected across the North Bay valleys, around a
tenth to a quarter of an inch throughout the Bay Area and Santa Cruz
County, and a few sprinkles to a tenth of an inch in the Central
Coast.

More significant rainfall is expected on Friday and Saturday with a
stronger low pressure system heading into the West Coast. The
current forecast calls for the bulk of the rain to start coming into
the region Friday evening through the day on Saturday and lingering
showers into Sunday. There`s still some time for rainfall totals to
fluctuate, but for the moment, 3-5 inches of rain are expected in
the North Bay coastal ranges, with 1-2.5" in the North Bay valleys,
0.5-1" in the Bay Area valleys and the Monterey Bay region, 1-2" in
the Santa Cruz and Santa Lucia mountains, and a few sprinkles to
0.25" in the southern Salinas Valley, the southeast corner of
Monterey County, and the southern half of San Benito County.

Further afield, the models are starting to show another storm system
coming into the region for the early part of the next work week, but
trying to pin down anything more specific is a fool`s errand. CPC
products are showing that into the third week of December,
temperatures above seasonal averages are likely (60-70% probability)
and that there`s still an ever-so-slight lean towards precipitation
totals above seasonal averages (33-40% probability).

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 321 AM PST Tue Dec 10 2024

Currently VFR at terminals thanks to decent low level mixing
(offshore flow) and clear skies. One potential spoiler this
morning is fog developing at KSTS. When the winds tanked earlier
fog briefly formed and quickly cleared as winds picked up. Still
low chance (10-20%) for fog so kept tempo in.

Vicinity of SFO...VFR. Easterly (SE to NE) flow through the
period.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...VFR. gusty SE winds pouring out of the
Salinas Valley.

.MARINE...
(Today through Sunday)
Issued at 321 AM PST Tue Dec 10 2024

Light to moderate easterly flow will persist today through
Wednesday. Winds will shift northwesterly on Thursday as a storm
system approaches from the west. Winds will initially be
strongest over the outer waters north of Point Reyes. Even
stronger winds are expected over the weekend as a storm moves
through. Wave heights will remain moderate through Wednesday, but
builds Thursday and again over the weekend due to east Pacific
storms.

.BEACHES...
Issued at 1237 AM PST Tue Dec 10 2024

Global wave models are showing that a pulse of high surf is coming
into the West Coast sometime around the upcoming weekend. These
models show that northwest swell could rise to 12-18 feet or more
across the outer waters, enhancing the risk for hazardous surf
conditions, especially along northwest facing beaches. Adding to the
dangers, this period also coincides with the peak of the December
"King Tides", the highest astronomical tides of the season, and the
existing tidal flood impacts to the low lying coastal regions could
be enhanced by runup from the intense surf. Historically, king tide
flooding peaks within a couple of hours of the highest high tide of
the day. It`s too early to put out high surf or coastal flooding
products at this time, but this is something that the operations
team will continue to monitor through the week.

High tide heights and times at San Francisco during the King Tides:
Thursday, December 12: 6.78 ft at 812 AM Friday, December 13: 6.98
ft at 854 AM Saturday, December 14: 7.07 ft at 937 AM Sunday,
December 15: 7.02 ft at 1022 AM Monday, December 16: 6.82 ft at
1108 AM
