.UPDATE...
Issued at 900 AM PST Fri Jan 9 2026

It was a chilly morning throughout the Bay Area and Central Coast.
Widespread temperatures in the upper 20s to 30s were observed across
the lower elevations with low temperatures in the upper 30s to low
40s across the higher elevations and portions of the coastline. The
Cold Weather Advisory and Extreme Cold Warning have both been
allowed to expire as temperatures warm through the remainder of the
morning. Expect another chilly morning again tomorrow with morning
lows in the low to mid 30s across the interior. It is likely that
additional Cold Weather products will be issued for tonight into
tomorrow morning. Otherwise, a High Surf Advisory and Beach Hazards
Statement remain in effect along the coastline. Never turn your back
on the ocean and stay safe if going to the beach.

.SHORT TERM...
Issued at 119 AM PST Fri Jan 9 2026
(Today and tonight)

High pressure building into the Great Basin and a coastal trough
developing off of California is creating offshore flow. Hyper-
localized gusts of 40-50mph have been observed on Fremont Peak, Mt.
St. Helena, and Mt. Umunhum. As there are no fire weather concerns
and the winds aren`t mixing down, this is more of a notable thing
rather than an impactful thing. Some high clouds associated with a
developing storm force low in the Eastern Pacific Ocean are
streaming in from the north. The clouds look thin enough on
satellite imagery that they shouldn`t be able to impact the minimum
temperature forecast too much. As such, cold weather products remain
in effect until 9AM this morning. Have decided to hold off on any
issuance of cold weather products for Friday night, the reason is
two-fold. It looks like some zones will be able to be omitted or
changed tonight. The Monterey Bay zones may need to be removed and
the Eastern Santa Clara Hills may need to change from an Extreme
Cold Warning to a Cold Weather Advisory. So to limit confusion, we
will take it one night at a time for now. This also gives us the
advantage of seeing what transpires this morning as this morning and
tomorrow morning are expected to be very similar.

.MARINE...
(Today through Wednesday)
Issued at 900 AM PST Fri Jan 9 2026

A gentle to moderate breeze persist over the coastal waters  today
through Sunday. A moderate period and larger northwesterly  swell
will continue produce a rough sea state with shoaling near  the
coast, harbor entrances, and bars. Seas will ease late Friday  and
into the weekend. Dry weather will continue with a high  pressure
system over the coastal waters and bays.

&&

.BEACHES...
Issued at 321 AM PST Fri Jan 9 2026

Overall beach/surf zone still remain hazardous due to moderate
period and higher swell. The largest surf/breaking waves will be
this morning before easing through the day.

High Surf Advisory still remains in effect through 10 pm Friday
PST. Expect large breaking waves up to 22 feet, strong rip
currents and sneaker waves from coastal Sonoma county to coastal
Monterey county, excluding the northern Monterey Bay shoreline
where a Beach Hazards Statement will be in effect. Large breaking
waves can overpower swimmers resulting in significant physical
injury and increase the risk of drowning.

Beach Hazards Statement remains in effect through Friday evening
for the northern Monterey Bay shoreline. Expect hazardous beach
conditions with strong rip currents, sneaker waves, and breaking
waves up to 15 feet. This will result in dangerous conditions
along the shoreline.

Stay off of jetties, piers, rocks, and other waterside
infrastructure. Remain out of the water to avoid hazardous surf
and NEVER turn your back on the ocean. Monitor local weather, surf
and tide forecasts at www.weather.gov/mtr.
