...New AVIATION...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 315 AM PDT Tue Jun 13 2023

Seasonably cool weather pattern continues today through midweek. A
minor inland warming trend by late in the work week as high
pressure begins to build. The next trough and associated dry cold
front will bring another cooling trend Sunday into Monday.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 315 AM PDT Tue Jun 13 2023

Profiler data shows the typical summertime inversion layer isn`t
really in place with temperatures actually cooling with height in
the boundary layer in response to a weak upper low across the
region. Cloud bases around 1500-2000 feet should preclude any fog
in the valleys with some local drizzle as the sun comes up. Broken
cloud layers should turn partly cloudy late morning through this
afternoon with highs mainly in the 60s near the water and 70s
inland. Even our typical inland hot spots are having a hard time
warming into the lower 80s which is pretty hard to do in the
middle of June. If your summer plans are taking you to the Sierra
be ready for another day of thunderstorms in the mountains. No
big changes in the temperature forecast for Weds as seasonably
cool pattern stays in place with West Coast trough.

.LONG TERM...
(Wednesday through Monday)
Issued at 315 AM PDT Tue Jun 13 2023

East Pac ridge will nose eastward with building heights and
warming airmass. This should lead to minor warming trend for
inland areas Thursday afternoon through Saturday but with forecast
highs generally in the upper 70s and mid 80s temps still only
warming to near or slightly below normal with 60s in place along
the coast. The building ridge will likely allow the marine layer
to reform for the coast and coastal valleys with morning fog.

Incoming trough arrives by later Sunday into Monday. Current
trajectory would keep it inland in more of an inside slider type
setup. We often will see one or two of these types of systems in
late June. Pretty strong cold advection aloft as 700 mb temps fall
to around 1 Celsius across the far North Bay by Monday night with
much colder air across the PacNW and Northern Rockies in association
with late season trough. Around here increasing onshore winds will
bring cooler temps to the coast but the setup may actually help to
mix out the marine layer and drive some northerly flow and drier
air (less RH and marine influence) by Tues/Weds of next week.

Will see if the atmosphere tries to reset into more of a climo
pattern behind that trough however the PNA teleconnection looks
negative (West Coast trough) through late June with the 500 mb
cluster analysis not showing any signs of warmth/ridging while the
CPC 8-14 day outlooks keep temps below normal for the region.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 444 AM PDT Tue Jun 13 2023

Upper low should keep cloud bases relatively high this morning
between 1500-2000 feet with a dirty and slow burn-off of morning
low clouds. However, profiler data shows no real inversion with
cooling aloft that should allow clouds to lift and slowly mix away
from the coast this morning. High clouds are making interpretation
of the fog product a little more difficult. Currently San Jose
reporting clear skies which seems suspect with Hayward reporting
cigs around 1500 feet and 2000 feet at San Martin so expect cigs
to be reported at KSJC shortly. In general an 18z burn-off is
forecast for most terminals except Monterey.

Vicinity of SFO...Medium confidence for VFR by 18z as clouds
lift/mix-out due to cooling of airmass aloft. Southwest winds
under 15 kt this afternoon.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO with visuals possible between
1730-18z.

Monterey Bay Terminals...Low cigs to persist all day for KMRY with
clearing at KSNS after 18z followed by an early return of cigs
shortly after 00z this evening.

.MARINE...
(Today through Sunday)
Issued at 236 AM PDT Tue Jun 13 2023

Generally light wind and seas across the waters through midweek
but increasing northwest winds over the northern out waters west
of Bodega Bay. Look for gusty southwest winds this afternoon and
evening in San Francisco Bay with small craft advisories in
effect. Open ocean waters will continue to feature mixed seas
with long period southerly swell and shorter period nw swell.

.MTR WATCHES/WARNINGS/ADVISORIES...
CA...None.
PZ...Small Craft Advisory from 3 PM this afternoon to 9 PM PDT this
     evening for PZZ530.
