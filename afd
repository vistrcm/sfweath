...New AVIATION, MARINE...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 112 AM PST Tue Nov 21 2023

Dry and mild conditions through mid week. Breezy winds return to
the higher elevations by late week with chilly interior
temperatures during the overnights from this weekend into early
next week.

&&

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 1205 AM PST Wed Nov 22 2023

High pressure aloft will gradually weaken across the region today in
response to a shortwave trough impinging on the region from the
northwest. Surface high pressure over the central Great Basin will
weaken in response as a weakening cold front approaches the Bay Area
tonight. The front is not expected to produce any precipitation and
the only real changes will be an uptick in cloud cover and a brief
return to onshore winds along the coast tonight. High temperatures
this afternoon should be mostly in the 60s across much of the Bay
Area with 70s for the South Bay and most of the Central Coast. Lows
tonight will dip into the 40s away from the coast with a few 30s
likely within the coldest inland valleys. Winds should remain
light.

&&

.LONG TERM...
(Thursday through Tuesday)
Issued at 1205 AM PST Wed Nov 22 2023

An upper trough should locate over the central Great Basin on
Thanksgiving day with dry conditions, seasonal temperatures, and
light winds. By Thursday night into Friday the pressure gradient
will increase as surface high pressure builds over the Great Basin.
This will result in a round of offshore winds for Thursday into
Friday. The greatest speeds are anticipated across the hills and
mountains of the North and East Bays. Winds at the moment appear to
remain below Wind Advisory thresholds but it will be breezy.
Offshore winds will persist into the weekend but speeds will
decrease. Expect a much drier airmass to be in place given the
offshore winds with overnight temperatures dropping into the 30s and
40s away from the coast. Some of the coldest inland areas of
Monterey and San Benito Counties stand a good chance at frost and/or
freezing temperatures over multiple night with Friday night being
the coldest. Dry weather looks to continue for the remainder of the
month with ensembles suggesting the next potential for wet weather
creeping back onto the horizon during the first week of December.
Still plenty of time for things to change, but we will be watching.
