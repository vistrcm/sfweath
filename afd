...New AVIATION, MARINE...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 237 AM PDT Sun Oct 8 2023

Temperatures are down and dew points are up as the marine layer
makes its triumphant return.

&&

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 237 AM PDT Sun Oct 8 2023

The heat advisory was cancelled last night, although the relief
will not be uniformly distributed. As the slow moving ridge
finally moves over the Great Basin, onshore wind are able to
return today. These winds will bring the cool marine layer air to
coastal areas, causing a to return to near normal temperatures
with highs in the mid 60s to low 70s. Inland areas wont see as
much benefit from this, and will remain 5-10 degrees above normal
with highs in the mid 80s to low 90s.

After five days of clear skies, low stratus clouds have returned
to the offshore waters. Some coastal areas will likely develop
cloud cover later this morning, with areas of mist and fog
possible until mid-morning. Inland areas will remain mostly sunny
through the day.

.LONG TERM...
(Monday through Saturday)
Issued at 237 AM PDT Sun Oct 8 2023

A cold front will move through the area Monday, bringing
widespread cooling. Temperatures will drop 10-15 degrees below
normal, in what will feel like a drastic shift from the previous
week of hot weather. This front will also bring a gloomy,
overcast day to all and a good chance of rain to most. The current
forecast is holding pretty steady with an 80-90% chance of rain
in the North Bay, a 50-60% chance in San Francisco and the East
Bay, and a 15-30% chance in the South Bay and Monterey Bay areas.
Total accumulation may approach 1/2"-1" in the North Bay
mountains, with 1/10"-1/4" more likely for the North Bay valleys,
San Francisco, and the East Bay. The South Bay and Monterey Bay
will likely stay below 1/10", except for locally higher amounts in
the Santa Cruz Mountains and Santa Lucia Range north of Big Sur.

After the front passes, some rain may linger through Tuesday.
The middle of the week doesn`t look too exciting as temperatures
gradually rebound to near normal by Thursday and hold steady
through the weekend. The next chance of rain is on Saturday the
15th. It`s too early to get into specifics, but it looks to be
less impactful than the rain coming up on early this week.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 415 AM PDT Sun Oct 8 2023

Low clouds and fog have developed along the coast early this
morning with clear skies inland. IFR-LIFR conditions will persist
around Monterey Bay through late morning with VFR being the most
likely outcome for most of the Bay Area terminals. Will hold
steady with a scattered lower cloud group at KSFO and KOAK where
there remains a low (but non-zero) probability that an IFR ceiling
may still yet develop towards daybreak. Confidence however is
simply too low to advertise this in the TAF. Any lower clouds
should mix out between 17 and 19Z.

Vicinity of SFO...VFR is the most likely forecast outcome through
the TAF period, however there is a low potential (20 percent) of
low stratus reaching the terminal between 14-18Z. For now only
hinted at this potential with a scattered low cloud group.
Amendments/TEMPOs are possible if confidence in ceiling
development increases towards daybreak however. Light winds
initially will become onshore around 15 kt this afternoon with
periodic higher gusts.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to KSFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...IFR-LIFR conditions developing at
present. Ceilings will persist through ~17-18Z before clearing to
VFR. At least transient visibility restrictions are anticipated in
BR/FG this morning, with the greatest potential at KMRY. Expect
afternoon clearing a light onshore winds this afternoon with low
clouds returning by early this evening.

.MARINE...
(Today through Friday)
Issued at 415 AM PDT Sun Oct 8 2023

Gentle to moderate northwest breezes continue and will turn
southerly tonight into Monday as a weather system approaches the
northern outer waters. By late Monday into early Tuesday, winds
will shift back northerly and will become breezy to gusty into
midweek. Hazards for small craft operations are possible for mid
week with increasing winds and seas as a moderate period northwest
swell approaches.
