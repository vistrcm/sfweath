...New AVIATION, MARINE...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 103 AM PDT Thu Apr 11 2024

Another warm day ahead today with temps trending cooler into the
weekend. Much cooler on Saturday with rain chances throughout the
region. Slight thunderstorm chances for coastal areas around Santa
Cruz and Monterey. Warming trend after the weekend into next week.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 103 AM PDT Thu Apr 11 2024

One last day to enjoy temps in the mid-to-upper 70s as afternoon
highs today are on track to be right around what was experienced
yesterday. Minor Heat Risk once again today for inland valley and
inland locations, which means that individuals who are extremely
sensitive to heat may experience heat-related illness. Never leave
children or pets unattended in vehicles, and remember to stay
hydrated if working or recreating outdoors in these inland areas.
Overnight temps tonight cool off nicely across the board into
upper 40s, a few degrees cooler than the night previous.

.LONG TERM...
(Friday through Wednesday)
Issued at 103 AM PDT Thu Apr 11 2024

By Friday, the influence of the incoming system begin to be felt
across the area as cloud cover increases, first in the North Bay
in the early morning, the southward across the rest of the area
by late morning to early afternoon. High temperatures Friday still
look to be rather pleasant, albeit cooler...mid-to-upper 60s for
inland valleys, upper 50s to lower 60s along the coast. With minor
adjustments to timing throughout the past few days, it looks like
most of the rainfall will be confined to the North Bay late
Friday, with some light rain beginning ahead of the main event in
the Santa Cruz Mtns as moist SW 925 mb flow increases notably by
about 6pm or so. Expect the main line of showers to spread
southward overnight into Saturday morning, with the heaviest
during the period roughly between sunrise and late morning.

Later on Saturday as the surface low approaches and makes its way
down the coast, the Central Coast will likely see an extended
period of orographically enhanced rainfall as the aforementioned
moist SW low-level flow continues to increase here through
Saturday night. It also appears that some degree of limited
instability will be present over the waters and along the coast
Saturday afternoon into the event, presenting the possibility of a
few thunderstorms. Forecast instability values from deterministic
guidance suggest that the greater risk resides across the
offshore marine areas. Some instability does build on Saturday
afternoon, however, it`s quite meager. In fact, the potential for
CAPE values over 100 J/KG are around 30%. This translates to a low
potential for a rumble of thunder or two on Saturday afternoon.
Chances for CAPE values over 100 J/kg are closer to 60% across the
marine zones. 700-500mb lapse rates do steepen around 7.5 C/km
offshore and so there remains some potential for waterspouts
(beyond 40-50 miles from the Central Coast). Snow levels do appear
that they`ll fall down sufficiently such that a few snow flakes
or very light snow showers unfold across central and southern
portions of the Santa Lucias. At this time, measurable snowfall is
not expected.

In terms of total rainfall, a slight increase with this forecast
package, but overall nothing too significant. Still looking at
about 1-2" for coastal ranges, with the higher amounts favoring
the Santa Cruz Mtns and Santa Lucia. Some favored upslope
locations along the Big Sur coast could see up to 3". Elsewhere,
generally about 0.5-1", with the lesser amounts across
rainshadowed valleys and locations further inland.

Heading into next week, we`ll see mid-level ridging set up across
the region which should limit the opportunities for precipitation.
Temperatures will rebound and we will be well on our way to near or
above normal warmth.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 430 AM PDT Thu Apr 11 2024

Morning satellite fog product paints a slightly different picture
than previous forecast. KOAK sounding also is a little more dry
in the boundary layer than some of the early model guidance.
Needless, a forecast update was needed for more optimistic flight
categories today. KSTS is the only terminal currently sitting at
IFR due to vsby 1-2 miles. Given the up and down vsby, covered
fog with tempo through the morning for KSTS. Elsewhere is
currently VFR. Shallow marine layer hugging SF Peninsula coast,
but clouds should stay in/near Gap and not impact SFO. Farther
south, cigs keep knocking on KMRY`s doorstep. Have delayed
intrusion until 13Z, but conf is 20% given one can see stars
outside right now. Better chance for more stratus Friday morning.

Vicinity of SFO...VFR through tonight. MVFR to IFR cigs late
tonight/early Friday with increased onshore flow and low level
RH.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...Stratus is still possible this morning as
clouds build over peninsula. VFR this afternoon. Cigs return late
tonight.

.MARINE...
(Today through Tuesday)
Issued at 430 AM PDT Thu Apr 11 2024

Persistent northerly flow over the coastal waters today. Coastal
jets will develop this afternoon leading to locally stronger
winds along the immediate coastline north of Point Reyes and near
Point Sur. A moderate northwesterly swell will traverse the
coastal waters too. A passing storm system will bring unsettled
weather Friday and over the weekend with rain, thunderstorms,
stronger winds, and steep fresh swell.

.MTR WATCHES/WARNINGS/ADVISORIES...
CA...None.

     for Pt Arena to Pt Reyes 0-10 nm-Pt Pinos to Pt Piedras
