.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 346 AM PDT Sun Apr 14 2024

Storm chances decrease this morning, but showers linger into
the afternoon before dry weather returns. A warming trend is
expected into the first half of the work week.

.UPDATE...
Issued at 906 AM PDT Sun Apr 14 2024

Radar and visible satellite this morning are showing the area of
surface low pressure slowly migrating southward off the Big Sur
coast. This is shifting the showers and thunderstorms south of our
service area and into the transverse range of So Cal. However, the
low is still pulling a cirrus shield and some low clouds down from
North Bay, which is bring the ceilings down as it slides
southward. So far, there has not been significant precipitation
associated with the northern flank of this low. North Bay sites in
the last 3 hours have only reported upwards of 0.03". Nothing to
write home about. The rest of the day? Look for a few lingering
showers lurking around through the balance of the day with slow
clearing this afternoon into the evening. Bonus, the daytime highs
will be about 2-5 degrees warmer than yesterday and about 7-12
degrees below normal. By Wednesday/Thursday, we could be 7-12
degrees above normal. Ah, spring.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 346 AM PDT Sun Apr 14 2024

Shower activity continues as the low slowly moves inland this
morning. Not much to show convection-wise, likely due to the overall
environment leaning on the cold and relatively stable side of
things.

Expect showers to lighten through the late morning as the low
becomes less organized while moving inland. Some drizzle activity
could linger around the Bay Area and Central Coast through the late
afternoon, but does not look impactful.

.LONG TERM...
(Monday through Saturday)
Issued at 346 AM PDT Sun Apr 14 2024

And back to dry weather.

A ridge pattern builds in quickly behind this weekend`s rains,
calling for a warming and drying trend. By the mid week, expect
widespread 60 and 70 degree highs and the lower 80s for the more
interior areas. The ridge weakens just ahead of next weekend,
allowing for more onshore flow, and cooler temperatures, but still
dry weather.

Looking into the longer-term forecast: Models and ensemble members
continue to push any possible rain-makers to the north of the
region, spelling out a long period of dry weather. Some weak rain
chances could be possible deeper into the forecast, but much can
change between now and the end of the month.

.AVIATION...
(18Z TAFS)
Issued at 1047 AM PDT Sun Apr 14 2024


A cirrus shield moving across the region from north to south is
bringing a high overcast with some low clouds hanging underneath
it. As this passes, ceilings will drop for a few hours to MVFR,
but then bounce back up to VFR in its wake. A few lingering
showers are possible with this lowering ceiling, but are not
expected to create any impacts. As these clouds move across the
region, it will also be the reintroduction of a more typical wind
pattern out of the West. The area of low pressure that brought the
rain yesterday and last night will finally shift out of the area
through Southern California this afternoon and evening, paving
the way for high pressure to build across the region. While the
high will not be textbook, but rather a little dirty (embedded
shortwave energy), it will help to clear out the higher clouds and
cause a decoupled lower atmosphere. With residual moisture from
the rain and high pressure building in, this is the recipe for
overnight low clouds to develop. This is shown in the TAFs with a
thickening lower deck, but not MVFR or IFR low, retaining VFR. The
lower decks will quickly erode in the hours following sunrise
tomorrow.

With respect to winds, there is nothing of note. Simply becoming
more normal.

Vicinity of SFO...VFR through the TAF period with lowering
ceilings tonight and eroding quickly tomorrow. See discussion
above for details.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...VFR through the TAF period. Models
indicate lowering ceilings tonight, yielding MVFR/IFR conditions.
More clearing tomorrow with normal onshore winds by afternoon.

.MARINE...
(Today through Friday)
Issued at 346 AM PDT Sun Apr 14 2024

Moderate to fresh winds will temporarily weaken early Sunday
before  stronger northerly winds return late Sunday. Moderate to
fresh  northerly winds will last through the work week creating
hazardous  conditions for small crafts. Showers will linger over
the waters  through Sunday with chances diminishing in coverage
throughout the  day. After the low moves away, ridging will start
to build with dry  conditions expected to last through the end of
the forecast period.
