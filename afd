.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 123 AM PST Mon Jan 27 2025

The low pressure system that gave us showers across the Central
Coast today has moved into Southern California, and dry and clear
conditions prevail across the region. For the next couple of days,
upper level winds will flow offshore and ridging will build across
the Northwest, leading to fair daytime weather. The clear skies and
calm winds will promote radiational cooling, leading to a pretty
cold morning across the region today. A Freeze Warning for
temperatures below freezing (as low as the middle to upper 20s in
southern Monterey County) across the inland Central Coast, the Santa
Clara Valley, and the eastern Santa Clara Hills, and a Frost
Advisory for temperatures in the low to mid 30s across the coastal
Central Coast, the Santa Cruz Mountains, the San Mateo County
Bayshore, the East Bay, and the North Bay Valleys are both in effect
until 9 AM. These low temperatures run around 5 to 10 degrees below
the seasonal averages. The recent rainfall across the Central Coast
will also make the conditions feel quite a bit cooler for those
outside. Along the Pacific Coast, lows hover in the lower to middle
40s, around or slightly below the seasonal averages.

Remember the Four P`s of Winter Weather:

People: Dress in layers and wear a hat that covers the ears. Pay
special attention to children and the elderly, who are more
vulnerable to the cold.
Plants: Bring potted plants indoors and keep outdoor plants and
trees protected.
Pets: Bring all pets indoors. Pets and other animals that have to be
kept outdoors should have an enclosed shelter.
Pipes: Make sure all external water pipes are insulated. Keep an
interior faucet running at a drip to prevent ice buildup.

Highs this morning warm into the lower to middle 60s across the
inland valleys, down into the middle to upper 50s along the coast,
and the middle 40s to the lower 50s in the higher elevations. Skies
remain clear across the region through the day and into the evening
hours.

.LONG TERM...
(Tuesday through Sunday)
Issued at 123 AM PST Mon Jan 27 2025

Clear skies persist through the day on Tuesday, and remain in place
in the inland regions on Wednesday and Thursday as diurnal stratus
returns to the coast. The clear skies and light winds will promote
radiational cooling inland and reinforce the potentially hazardous
conditions. Lows in the lower to middle 30s in the inland valleys
and the upper 30s into the lower 40s for the coastal regions have
resulted in the continuation of a Freeze Watch for all of the inland
Bay Area and Central Coast from Tuesday morning to Thursday morning.
It`s likely that Frost Advisories and Freeze Warnings will need to
be issued for Tuesday morning after the current Freeze Warnings and
Frost Advisories expire.

Friday marks the beginning of a pattern change as the upper level
ridge erodes and a troughing pattern brings the next chances for
rain across the forecast region. Confidence is increasing that the
first batch of rain on Friday into Saturday will be relatively
modest, with the current forecast calling for around a quarter to a
half an inch of rain across the North Bay, dropping off rather
sharply to the south. The big forecast challenge is that the
ensemble model means suggest that there will be a plume of moisture
directed at the West Coast, and from prior experience, where that
plume of moisture sets up could dramatically impact the actual
rainfall totals from these plumes, especially for regions along the
edge of the plume. That appears to be the case on Friday, with the
plume appearing to be directed more towards the Pacific Northwest.
Beyond that point, rainfall is expected to continue, but how much
additional rainfall could arrive is still extremely uncertain. The
plume of moisture does make its way towards the south, but the
ensemble models disagree on how robust the moisture tap will be,
with the European ENS ensemble model suggesting a more robust
moisture tap than the American GEFS or Canadian GEPS ensembles. In
addition, cluster analysis of the ensemble members shows that there
is enough variation within each of the main ensemble models to have
substantial clusters from all three of them support both drier and
wetter cluster solutions. This will be a system to watch over the
next few days, so keep an eye out for further refinements in the
forecast.
