.SHORT TERM...
Issued at 418 AM PST Tue Dec 2 2025
(Today and tonight)

Zonal flow over the region tightens as an upper level low develops
and slides into the Great Basin by Wednesday. Quiet weather is on
tap, with light offshore flow today. Though winds increase late
tonight and peak Wednesday morning for the North Bay, Bay Area, and
Santa Cruz Mountains. These winds will have gusts around 30-45 mph,
with locally higher gusts possible on higher terrain in the North
Bay mountains. Conditions will dry out some; however, given earlier
rainfalls this year fuel moisture should mitigate fire weather
concerns. &&

.LONG TERM...
Issued at 418 AM PST Tue Dec 2 2025
(Wednesday through Monday)

Winds begin to wind down during the late morning and afternoon hours
on Wednesday. After that fairly quiet weather remains on tap as
upper level ridging noses into the region. Ensembles hold weak
ridging through the weekend, perhaps even into early next week. This
matches the Climate Prediction Center`s 8-14 day outlook which has
us leaning above normal for temperatures, with near normal or just
below normal chances for precipitation.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 534 AM PST Tue Dec 2 2025

Patches of fog are affecting the more interior areas in the North
Bay and East Bay. Expect mostly light winds through the morning but
winds look to increase slightly into the afternoon as fog and low
clouds clear.winds weaken again into the early night becoming mostly
light and variable. Low clouds build along the coast and bays into
the night with the more interior valleys seeing low CIGs as well.
Cloud cover and fog erode into early Wednesday as dry easterly winds
build into the region. These winds look to be breezy and gusty in
certain areas, with some potential for LLWS concerns.

Vicinity of SFO...Light winds last through the morning before more
moderate northwest winds arrive into the afternoon and reduce into
the night. As winds reduce, LIFR CIGs build around the SF Bay and
fill over SFO with some reduction in visibilities from pockets of
fog. Winds increase and turn Northeast into early Wednesday, causing
the cloud cover and fog to dissipate and erode.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...Light winds last at MRY through the
afternoon, while moderate southeast drainage winds affect SNS. Winds
become moderate and west to northwest for the afternoon, but become
light again in the evening and into the night. Expect patches of fog
and LIFR CIGs further into the night, but CIGs and fog erode into
early Wednesday as easterly winds build.

&&

.MARINE...
(Today through Sunday)
Issued at 425 AM PST Tue Dec 2 2025

Expect hazardous marine conditions into the afternoon afternoon
as northerly breezes increase to become fresh to strong and seas
become rough to very rough. Gale force gusts are expected over the
northern outer waters. Conditions improve Thursday with moderate
northerly breezes and moderate seas. Locally strong winds and
rough seas will remain possible over the far northwestern portion
of the northern outer waters.

.BEACHES...
Issued at 534 AM PST Tuesday Dec 2 2025

A Beach Hazards Statement remains in effect for the coastline
from Sonoma County to Monterey County through 10 PM PST Wednesday
evening. Breaking waves 10 to 14 feet, with long lulls of 10 to 20
minutes or more between largest sets can be expected. Some of the
favored break points may exceed 20 feet at times. Forerunners
will be 18+ seconds with heights of 2-5 feet into tonight
resulting in the greatest risk for sneaker waves. This combined
with high astronomical tides in the morning hours will increase
the aforementioned risk. Sneaker waves can unexpectedly run
significantly farther up the beach than normal, including over
rocks and jetties. Rip currents are typically more frequent and
stronger in the vicinity of jetties, inlets, and piers.
