...New UPDATE...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 107 AM PST Mon Feb 12 2024

Dry weather conditions will prevail throughout the first part of
the workweek. A weak weather system will bring a chance of
beneficial rain to the region Wednesday into Thursday before a
series of more significant storms take aim at the region for
Friday and through early next week.

&&

.UPDATE...
Issued at 855 AM PST Mon Feb 12 2024

Sounding like a broken record with the morning weather impacts -
fog and frost once again. This morning however, features a Dense
Fog Advisory for the N Bay and S Salinas Valleys with cams and
automated sensors showing vsby 1/4 of a mile or less. Other inland
valleys and SF Bay show fog too, but not dense enough to warrant a
Dense Fog Advisory. Fog will linger through mid-morning. Frost
Advisory for interior Central Coast will expire at 9 AM.
Temperatures this morning are within a few degrees of yesterday
morning. In other words, upper 30s to 40s coast/urban areas and
more 30s for inland valleys.

No update needed...

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 107 AM PST Mon Feb 12 2024

A Frost Advisory remains in effect until 9 AM PST this morning for
interior parts of the Central Coast and Eastern Santa Clara Hills as
temperatures dip into the low-to-mid 30s.

For the rest of today, once morning low clouds and fog dissipate,
expect high temperatures to range from the upper 50s to lower 60s
and 40s in the peaks. Passing high clouds are also expected today
and into tonight.

Tonight, temperatures will be on a warming trend with upper 30s to
mid/upper 40s near the coast and San Francisco Bay Shoreline. Some
of the region`s colder spots in interior Monterey/San Benito County
may briefly drop into the low/mid 30s, but no widespread frost
expected tonight.

.LONG TERM...
(Tuesday through next Saturday)
Issued at 1250 PM PST Sun Feb 11 2024

Zonal flow keeps quiet weather in place through at least Tuesday
night - rinse and repeat with seasonable daytime temps and chilly
overnight lows. Valley fog will be possible each night with
patchy frost far interior valleys.

Still looking at a pattern change mid-week and beyond as the
Pacific becomes more active again. A decent upper level jet will
march its way across the Pacific opening the storm door again. A
weak disturbance currently near the tail end of the Aleutians
gets fueled by the upper jet and deepens as it heads to CA
Tuesday/Wednesday. As a result, rain returns to the region as
early as Wednesday. While the main surface low passes well to the
north a front will sweep through Wednesday into Thursday. This
system doesn`t appear to be overly strong...more of our standard
winter time front. Precip will ultimately taper from NW to SE
behind the front on Thursday. Rainfall amounts have been nudged
upward for Wed/Thur: North Bay and Coastal Mts 0.25-0.75", rest
of Bay Area 0.10-0.25", interior Monterey/San Benito less than
0.10". The fropa will usher slightly stronger winds with gusts in
the 25-35 mph.

A brief break will be possible late Thursday into Friday before
attention turns to a deep low pressure spinning near the Gulf of
AK. Impressive to see some guidance dropping the pressure below
970mb. The front attached to this low is much stronger, has more
dynamics, and a deeper moisture tap. Steadier rainfall returns
early Friday and is expected to increase in coverage and
intensity through Saturday. There will likely be a window where
heavy rain occurs with the front late Friday/early Saturday. Conf
is lower on exact timing. Precip tapers briefly late Saturday
before increasing again on Sunday as another system quickly
follows the first front. Rainfall amounts Friday-Sunday: Coastal
mts 4-6", North Bay 1.5-3", elsewhere 1.0-2.0". Given the recent
rains and saturated soil minor flooding concerns will return.
Stronger wind will also be possible during this time frame. It
should be noted the upcoming pattern change will not be as strong
as the last one, especially with the wind. Regardless weather
impacts will return to the state by next weekend. Stay tuned as
the forecast evolves.
