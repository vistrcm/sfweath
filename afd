...New SYNOPSIS, SHORT TERM, LONG TERM, AVIATION, MARINE...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 313 AM PDT Sun Jul 28 2024

Below average temperatures continue through mid-week as upper
level troughing persists. Temperatures are expected to warm above
average again by late week as upper level ridging builds.

&&

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 313 AM PDT Sun Jul 28 2024

Below average temperatures continue again today as upper level
troughing persists over the Western US. High temperatures will
generally be in the 70s to low 80s across the interior. For coastal
areas, high temperatures will be in the upper 50s to mid 60s
directly along the coastline and upper 60s to low 70s slightly
inland from the coast. Stratus, again, throws a caveat into the
forecast where locations may struggle to reach their forecasted
highs if stratus persists for longer than anticipated. Yesterday was
a prime example of this where prolonged stratus coverage caused high
temperatures to struggle to reach the upper 60s to low 70s across
the interior. Currently, satellite shows impressive widespread
stratus coverage across the Bay Area and Central Coast with a fairly
deep marine layer between 2000-2500 feet (as shown on the Fort Ord
Profiler). Stratus is forecast to dissipate by mid to late morning
but continued upper level troughing and a fairly deep marine layer
will result in stratus returning by the evening/overnight.

Several coastal locations saw trace to a few hundredths of an inch
of drizzle yesterday morning. If you missed out on it yesterday, you
may be in luck! There is a 10-20% chance for trace drizzle across
coastal areas early this morning and again tonight.

.LONG TERM...
(Monday through Saturday)
Issued at 313 AM PDT Sun Jul 28 2024

Seasonal to below average temperatures continue through mid-week
before seasonal to slightly above average temperatures return late
week. The upper level low pressure system, which increased troughing
over the West Coast, will continue to move northeastward. As the
trough departs, upper level flow will flatten slightly/become for
the first portion of the week before ridging builds by late week.
High temperatures Monday will closely resemble Sunday`s with highs
in the 70s to mid 80s inland and upper 50s to low 70s closer to the
coast. Beginning Tuesday, temperatures across the interior will warm
back into the 80s to low 90s with temperatures increasing into the
mid to upper 90s across favored hot spots by Thursday/Friday.

Moderate uncertainty continues as to how high temperatures will
reach as upper level ridging builds. Ensemble cluster guidance is in
better agreement that the ridge will be centered slightly east of
the West Coast but disagrees as to how strong it will be. Looking at
ECMWF and GFS ensemble guidance shows the deterministic forecast is
on the cooler end of the ensemble guidance spectrum. Comparatively,
the NBM deterministic forecast does a better job of more evenly
splitting the upper and lower end of ensemble forecast highs. Given
model disagreement, it is possible that forecast high temperatures
at the end of the week will increase by a few degrees as we get
closer to it. Looking beyond the end of this forecast period, upper
level riding is expected to persist into the beginning of August
with temperatures likely to be above average. The 8-14 day CPC
outlook guidance showing 60-70% chance of above average temperatures
continuing through August 10th.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 313 AM PDT Sun Jul 28 2024

Marine layer still very deep this morning, promoting stratus well
inland and affecting all terminals with MVFR/IFR cigs. Moderate-high
confidence in clearing time this morning, though stratus is expected
to linger around coastal areas and through the Golden Gate through
much of the day. Not much change in the wind outside of the typical
diurnal onshore pattern. High confidence in stratus return tonight
with another round of MVFR/IFR cigs affecting most terminals.

Vicinity of SFO...MVFR/IFR cigs through this morning with a better
chance of clearing compared to yesterday. Currently have moderate-
high confidence in clearing around the 18-19Z hour, though stratus
will likely linger along the coast and Golden Gate through the day.
Moderate confidence in stratus returning by about 02-03Z this
evening with another round of MVFR/IFR cigs.

SFO Bridge Approach... Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...MVFR/IFR through this morning with a short
period of clearing this afternoon. Timing and clearing pattern today
looks to mirror what occured yesterday with perhaps a little more
time of VFR (between about 20-01Z) before returning to MVFR/IFR cigs
overnight tonight.

&&

.MARINE...
(Today through Friday)
Issued at 313 AM PDT Sun Jul 28 2024

Winds continue to reduce overnight with hazardous conditions in
the northern outer waters expected to ease through this morning.
Significant wave heights will continue to abate through the
weekend but will increase slightly by the middle of the week.
Areas of drizzle are likely over the waters through this morning
and the early part of the week.

.MTR WATCHES/WARNINGS/ADVISORIES...
CA...None.
PZ...Small Craft Advisory until 9 AM PDT this morning for Pt Arena to
     Pt Reyes 10-60 NM.
