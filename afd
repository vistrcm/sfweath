...New MARINE...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 151 AM PDT Fri Oct 11 2024

Fairly quite weather today before a weak frontal boundary brings
increasing clouds and rain on Saturday, particularly over the North
Bay. Additional rainfall possible by the middle of the upcoming
week.

&&

.UPDATE...
Issued at 906 AM PDT Fri Oct 11 2024

A deepening marine layer is bringing low stratus deep into the
valleys this morning. These clouds are expected to retreat back to
the coast over the next 2-3 hours, and there should be clear skies
for Fleet Week activities in San Francisco this afternoon.
Otherwise the rain forecast on Saturday has trended a bit dryer
and we are starting to get a clearer picture on the timing as the
high resolution guidance starts to resolve the event. Scattered
showers will start before sunrise in the North Bay and very light
rain should reach San Francisco by the early afternoon. San Jose
south will be lucky to get more than a few drops or some coastal
drizzle. In the longer range, the system next Wednesday is
starting to look more interesting with full support of the jet
stream and a deeper moisture tap.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 151 AM PDT Fri Oct 11 2024

Fairly quite weather through today with an increase in clouds as an
upper level low approaches the coast. Temperatures will generally
range from the upper 70`s to mid 80`s across the interior, with low-
to-mid 70`s just inland, and 60`s near the coast. These temperatures
will generally be near seasonal averages.

Tonight, expecting increased moisture as the upper level low nears
the coast with possible post frontal drizzle and/or light rain. A
modest marine layer will promote low clouds to spread inland into
the coastal adjacent valleys. However, temperatures will remain in
the upper 40`s to mid 50`s across much of the region.

&&

.LONG TERM...
(Saturday through Thursday)
Issued at 151 AM PDT Fri Oct 11 2024

Light rain will spread into the North Bay early Saturday morning and
spread southward throughout the morning and into the afternoon.
Rainfall amounts will be greatest over the North Bay with coastal
areas of Sonoma and Marin counties picking up between 0.15" and
0.30" with less than 0.10" for Napa and San Francisco counties.
Elsewhere, trace amounts to around 0.05" will be possible in the
Santa Cruz Mountains and Monterey Bay region.

From previous forecaster: "After the front passes, some cooler air
aloft could support a few isolated showers on Sunday, but it doesn`t
look very impressive. The sun should try to peek back out Sunday
afternoon. An active long wave pattern will allow ridging to rebuild
Monday-Tuesday causing a brief rebound in temperatures. While the
uncertainty starts to balloon, there is an increasing chance of a
deeper trough with a better moisture tap bringing more widespread
rain on Wednesday or so."

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 350 AM PDT Fri Oct 11 2024

Satellite shows low clouds have moved over most of the coastal and
a couple inland terminals, creating a mix of MVFR, IFR, and LIFR
conditions over those terminals. VFR will return for all sites
between 17-18Z, but MVFR conditions are expected to build by Friday
night starting 06-07Z in the North Bay and Monterey Bay terminals,
followed by the remaining coastal terminals overnight. Low
confidence for ceilings redeveloping over KAPC, KSJC, and KLVK
Friday night, but models do suggest there is a chance for KSJC and
KAPC to see MVFR conditions near 09Z. Onshore winds will turn S/SE
by late Friday night.

Vicinity of SFO...VFR continues. There is a chance for MVFR/IFR
ceilings to develop near the terminal as low cigs hover around the
terminal. Moderate confidence on MVFR ceilings building late Friday
night/early Saturday morning as models show some disagreement and
suggest VFR may prevail through the TAF period. Onshore breezy winds
will turn late Friday to light S/SE winds.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...LIFR with clearing near 16-17Z. There is a
chance ceilings may not clear until 18Z. Friday night MVFR ceilings
will build, as well as S/SE light winds.

&&

.MARINE...
(Today through Wednesday)
Issued at 924 AM PDT Fri Oct 11 2024

Gentle northwesterly breezes continue through the day today,
though are expected to strengthen slightly to become moderate late
tonight and turn southerly as a weak low approaches the region.
This system will bring light rain across the waters, particularly
the northern waters Saturday morning, with rain chances
diminishing into Saturday afternoon. Winds will weaken and turn
northwesterly again early Sunday, gradually building to a fresh
breeze by mid week when the next light rain chances approach.
