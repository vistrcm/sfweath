...New UPDATE, MARINE...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 316 AM PDT Sun Oct 27 2024

A cold front is expected to pass through the Bay Area and Central
Coast today bringing with it much cooler temperatures, elevated
precipitation chances, and gustier winds. Unsettled conditions
will continue through the end of the week as the pattern remains
active.

&&

.UPDATE...
Issued at 913 AM PDT Sun Oct 27 2024

A couple hundredths have been picked up in the North Bay as the
cold front approaches the coast. The low clouds have also
returned, with cloud bases below 1,000 feet across the majority of
the Bay Area. The Monterey Bay Area is the exception, where a dry
slot of air is keeping the low clouds away. High resolution
guidance continues to trend drier through the next 48 hours, and
SREF now only has a 10% chance of exceeding 1/10th of an inch
south of the Golden Gate through mid week.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 316 AM PDT Sun Oct 27 2024

Today marks the start of a pattern shift across the Bay Area and
Central Coast as a cold front prepares to move through our region.
This cold front will bring elevated precipitation chances across our
CWA and allow temperatures to cool well below seasonal averages. The
storm door will then remain open through the next week with cooler
temperatures and elevated precipitation chances continuing.

As advertised, light rain returns today and with precipitation
accumulations up to 0.15" expected across the North Bay and
accumulations up to a few hundredths of an inch (generally less than
0.05") expected across coastal portions of the rest of the Bay Area.
The NBM and the HRRR show scattered showers reaching the North Bay
early this morning before showers gradually move southward, and
drizzle chances increase, through mid to late morning along the SF
Peninsula. While precipitation accumulations will be fairly minimal,
this will still be the most rain that many portions of the Bay Area
have seen since May. With that in mind, give yourself extra time
while travelling today as roads may be slicker than normal after the
first rain of the season.

This cold front will also see us switch from slightly above average
temperatures to well below normal temperatures. Tonight will be the
warmest night of the forecast period with low temperatures generally
in the 50s. Across the lower elevations, low temperatures this
morning are running 5 to 10 degrees above what they were at this
time yesterday. That being said, fall weather returns today with the
passage of this cold front, resulting in high temperatures dropping
into the 60s to low 70s across the board. Tonight`s temperatures
will also decrease with lows expected to dip into the upper 40s to
low 50s across the lower elevations and into the low to mid 40s
across the higher elevations. As temperatures continue to cool, now
is the time to make sure your furnace is in working order as we
shift out of summer mode and into fall-winter mode. Gusty westerly
winds between 15 to 20 mph will develop late Sunday into Monday,
continuing through Tuesday, in the wake of frontal passage. Stronger
30+ mph gusts remain possible in mountain gaps/passes and across
elevated terrain late Sunday through Tuesday.

.LONG TERM...
(Monday through Saturday)
Issued at 316 AM PDT Sun Oct 27 2024

Elevated rain chances and below average temperatures continue
through Saturday as the pattern remains active. Much cooler high
temperatures begin Monday and continue through the rest of the
forecast period, with highs in the 50s along the coast and in the
low to mid 60s inland. These temperatures, while more seasonal, are
still running 5 to 15 degrees below where we would normally be this
time of year. Cooler overnight temperatures return as well with most
locations along the coast and across the interior dipping into the
mid to upper 40s while temperatures across the higher elevations and
within North Bay Valleys look to dip into the upper 30s. Monday
night into Tuesday morning looks to be the coldest night this week.
Anyone traveling early Tuesday morning should consider bundling up
as gusty winds will lead to some wind chill concerns that morning.
As a reminder, wind chill is what the temperature feels like on
human skin based on a combination of the observed wind speed and the
observed temperature. The cooler the temperature and the stronger
the winds, the colder air will feel on your skin while outdoors.

In terms of precipitation, scattered showers from our first system
will persist into Monday with a slight (5-10%) chance of
thunderstorms across the North Bay. Conditions will become drier
Tuesday as weak shortwave ridging moves inland. However, this will
be short lived as a second upper level low will move inland
Wednesday and bring with it the chance for light rain again. Totals
will be fairly s similar to our current system with accumulations
between 0.1-0.2" across the North Bay while areas to the south will
see comparatively lower totals up to 0.1" between Wednesday and
Thursday. A third system looks to approach Friday into Saturday and
will potentially bring wetting rains to both the Bay Area and the
Central Coast. While accumulations will change as we get closer to
this system, currently we are looking at more widespread totals of
0.1-0.2" of rain throughout our CWA.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 441 AM PDT Sun Oct 27 2024

Light winds and MVFR/IFR ceilings will persist through the morning
hours for terminals in the North Bay, Bay Area and East Bay,
eventually lifting to VFR in the afternoon with breezy W/NW surface
winds, and periods of scattered light showers and drizzle. Onshore
flow with a building marine layer will result in MVFR/IFR ceilings
developing once again later tonight, along with patchy fog and
drizzle, especially near the coast.

Vicinity of SFO...MVFR ceilings are likely to prevail through most
of the day, with scattered light rain and drizzle possible until
around sunset. VFR is expected in the evening hours, with MVFR
conditions likely during the overnight hours.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...VFR conditions with relatively light winds
are expected to prevail through much of the day, with MVFR/IFR
ceilings likely to develop after sunset and persist through the
overnight hours.

.MARINE...
(Today through Friday)
Issued at 913 AM PDT Sun Oct 27 2024

Widespread drizzle, areas of light showers and breezy winds build
through the day. As wave heights increase in response to gusty
northerly winds, expect significant wave heights of 10-12 feet
develop in the outer waters by Monday, creating hazardous
conditions to small craft vessels. Gusty northwest winds spread
across the waters on Monday. Winds and seas ease in the mid week,
but look to increase again in the late week.
