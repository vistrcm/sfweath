...New AVIATION, MARINE...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 112 AM PST Tue Nov 21 2023

Dry and mild conditions through mid week. Breezy winds return to
the higher elevations by late week with chilly interior
temperatures during the overnights from this weekend into early
next week.

&&

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 112 AM PST Tue Nov 21 2023

A high pressure ridge aloft will extend from offshore of SoCal into
the Central Rockies. Meanwhile a shortwave trough will progress from
the northeast Pacific into the Pacific Northwest states. Strong high
pressure in the low levels will center over the Great Basin with a
modest offshore pressure gradient persisting. This will result in
offshore winds through the short term period along with lowered
daytime humidity values along with seasonally warm high
temperatures. Not really looking at any fire weather concerns given
recent rainfall, but temperatures may near or exceed record highs in
a few places this afternoon given somewhat easily achievable values
such as the current record high for SFO which is only 70 degrees.
Otherwise look for another cool night with drainage winds and lows
dipping into the 40s away from the immediate coast and bays.

&&

.LONG TERM...
(Wednesday through Monday)
Issued at 112 AM PST Tue Nov 21 2023

Look for a weaker offshore pressure gradient through mid week with
a cooling trend as troughing and a dry cold front move through the
region. Strong high pressure returns to the central Great Basin for
late week with a return of breezier offshore winds by Friday morning
in the hills. These winds may persist over the weekend with mild
daytime temperatures. Chilly overnight readings return over the
weekend into early next week with the typically colder inland spots
seeing temperatures drop into the 30s. Frost/freeze conditions are
possible with the greatest potential being over southern Monterey
County and within the North Bay valleys.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 319 AM PST Tue Nov 21 2023

VFR through the period. High clouds moving through during the
early half of TAF period. Winds remain relatively light with very
little forcing in the larger scale pattern.

Vicinity of SFO...VFR through the period. Winds light through the
period as well, with a NE component this afternoon before becoming
variable again tonight.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...VFR through the period. Drainage flow
along the valleys will transition to light onshore flow this
afternoon.

.MARINE...
(Today through Sunday)
Issued at 319 AM PST Tue Nov 21 2023

Winds are relatively calm with gentle northerly winds over the
waters through Wednesday as high pressure builds over the region.
Winds increase to become fresh to strong out of the north once
again by the Thanksgiving holiday as a new front approaches.
Slight chance of rain briefly Wednesday night over the northern
outer waters. A new northwesterly swell train 12 to 14 seconds
begins to build into the waters midweek.
