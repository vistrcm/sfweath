...New AVIATION...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 1210 AM PDT Sat Jul 29 2023

Quiet weather continues with seasonal temperatures. Expect the
typical ebb and flow of coastal clouds each night/morning giving
way to sunny afternoon conditions across the interior. Breezy
onshore winds will occur each afternoon.

&&

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 1210 AM PDT Sat Jul 29 2023

No real change to the large-scale pattern with upper low pressure
over the northeast Pacific and subtropical ridging centered over
Arizona and New Mexico. Our area will remain along the ridge
periphery with southwest flow aloft and periodic bouts of mid-high
clouds as weak perturbations rotate around the high pressure
center. The marine layer hasn`t changed appreciably in the past 24
hours and its depth remains in the 1000-1300 ft range per area
profilers. Low stratus remains limited so far, but should develop
and expand around coastal portions of the Bay Area and Central
Coast yet again with some patchy fog and drizzle. Low clouds
should clear to the coast through the morning hours with sunshine
returning for most areas by noon at latest. Highs will be seasonal
with 60s and 70s for the coast and coast-adjacent valleys, while
warmer 80s and 90s prevail inland. Low tonight will dip into the
50s for the low elevations with 60s to around 70 in the hills.

&&

.LONG TERM...
(Sunday through Friday)
Issued at 1210 AM PDT Sat Jul 29 2023

The large-scale picture will remain fairly static with upper
troughing from western Canada into NorCal and strong high pressure
over the southern CONUS. Subtle daily changes in temperatures and
cloud cover should occur as these upper features battle for
influence but otherwise nothing really noteworthy in the weather
department through late week.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 405 AM PDT Sat Jul 29 2023

IFR stratus clouds were expanding across coastal areas early this
morning with clear skies/VFR inland. Stratus has made it to
KOAK/KSFO/KMRY and should also develop at/around KSTS/KAPC/KSNS
through the early to mid morning hours. Visibility reductions in
BR/FG are also expected at KSTS and for the Monterey Bay
terminals. Low clouds will dissipate by 16-18z today with breezy
onshore winds during the afternoon and evening.

Vicinity of SFO...IFR ceilings made it to the terminal and should
persist through around 16Z. Breezy northwest winds develop this
afternoon with gusts of 25-30 kt. Moderate confidence in an IFR
ceiling returning around 08-10Z tonight and persisting into Sunday
morning.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO. Low clouds will fill in from
the north around the terminal, but the approach may remain clear.

Monterey Bay Terminals...LIFR stratus has developed and recently
reached KMRY. Stratus should make it to KSNS by 12-13Z. Patchy
BR/FG possible through late morning as well. VFR returns 16-18Z
with breezy onshore winds this afternoon.

.MARINE...
(Tonight through next Wednesday)
Issued at 944 PM PDT Fri Jul 28 2023

Wind driven seas will continue into next week as strong and gusty
northwest winds persist across the coastal waters. Gusty
afternoon and evening winds are expected over the San Francisco
Bay, the Delta, as well as across the Monterey Bay. In addition to
short period wind waves, a small southerly swell will continue to
move through the waters through the forecast period.
