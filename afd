.SHORT TERM...
Issued at 205 AM PST Sat Feb 7 2026
(Today and tonight)

Current nighttime microphysics satellite imagery shows a large
swath of high clouds slowly overspreading the Bay Area.
Eventually, these high clouds will obscure the view of the low
level stratus and fog that has developed over the waters and into
the North and East Bays, and Salinas Valley. Many obs around and
south of SFO/OAK are showing more of a low stratus layer with
ceilings somewhere between 400 and 600 feet. Whereas looking at
local webcams in the North Bay, it appears that any dense fog is
isolated which prevents the need for an advisory at the moment.
However, should conditions continue to deteriorate, it is possible
that a Dense Fog advisory may be needed.

Other than the increased cloud cover, conditions today should be
fairly similar to yesterday. High temperatures in the upper
50s/low 60s along the coast, mostly 60s inland, and the chance for
low 70s in southern Monterey and San Benito counties. Skies
should clear out once again tonight which should allow for another
chance for radiative fog in favored valley locations.

Sunday`s temperatures should be fairly similar to what is
observed today. A weak shortwave trough is expected to move inland
over Oregon late Sunday morning and through the day. While the
bulk of the impacts will be in Northern California (and points
north), the trough should extend far enough south for some
measurable (albeit limited) precip to fall in the North Bay. The
most recent NBM is a little bullish about timing, bringing PoPs in
much sooner than any ensemble suite or hi-res guidance. The
forecast was adjusted to keep the (20 to 40 percent) chance for
rain in the North Bay today, but likely not arriving until the
afternoon. There is still a little uncertainty in how far south
the rain will travel. While an isolated sprinkle is possible late
afternoon/evening for San Francisco/Oakland, confidence is low.

.LONG TERM...
Issued at 205 AM PST Sat Feb 7 2026
(Sunday through Friday)

Despite the lack of rain, increased moisture aloft should
increase cloud cover over much of the area Sunday Night through
Tuesday morning. While patchy fog cannot be completely ruled out
for early next week, the increased cloud cover should help stymie
its development. The next trough will swing over the Bay Area and
the Central Coast from Tuesday through early Wednesday morning.
While it does look like this trough has a better chance for much
of the area to receive some rain, modeled QPF continues to trend
down compared to previous model runs. Perhaps some higher
elevations in the coastal ranges could see a half an inch of rain,
but a third of an inch or less is possible for the coastal areas
with inland rain shadowed areas maybe seeing a tenth.

Cooler air advection will slowly filter in with this trough. High
temperatures Tuesday will be more closer to seasonal normals in
the 50s and lows in the 40s. There is even a chance for some
inland areas to have lows return into the upper 30s by Thursday
morning.

An upper level ridge is expected to develop over California late
Thursday through Friday. Drier conditions are expected with a
chance for high temperatures to bounce back momentarily into the
low 60s. The next upper level low is expected to move south from
the Bay of Alaska on Friday and deepen below 530 dam out over the
ocean, west of southwestern Oregon. That low is expected to weaken
slightly as it moves over northern California Saturday into
Sunday. Models are still showing some disagreement in location,
rain amounts, and timing of the system to have confidence in the
details. But many ensemble members support that this could be the
next chance for a soaking rain over the area. And with 925 mb
temperatures expected to drop down to the low single digits with
this system passage, highs in the 50s and lows in the 40s, if not
upper 30s, are expected next weekend.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 428 AM PST Sat Feb 7 2026

A shallow layer of cooler maritime air, stratus clouds and fog
/LIFR-IFR-MVFR/ continue to move inland on onshore breezes. Fresh
onshore breezes continue to respond to the recently developed SFO-
SAC pressure gradient, currently the gradient is 1.1 mb. High
clouds are also moving over the area at least partially obscuring
the view of stratus and fog on satellite imagery.

Stratus ceilings and fog are forecast to improve to MVFR-VFR by
late morning. The highest probability of VFR today is during
maximum solar heating during the afternoon with carryover of VFR
along the immediate coastline to early evening before stratus and
fog /LIFR-IFR/ redevelop. Low to moderate confidence VFR continues
at the Bay Area terminals during the evening, otherwise increasing
probability of stratus and fog /LIFR-IFR/ tonight and Sunday
morning.

Vicinity of SFO...Stratus /LIFR-IFR/ lifting to MVFR by 18z today
and VFR by 20z. Stratus /IFR/ redevelops late tonight 11z with a
low to moderate confidence forecast MVFR ceiling near 18z Sunday.
West to northwest wind 5 to 10 knots.

SFO Bridge Approach...High resolution boundary layer humidity
forecasts show stratus /IFR-MVFR/ to 18z then mixing out to VFR
for the remainder of the morning to the afternoon. Otherwise
similar to SFO.

Vicinity of SJC and OAK...Here too high resolution boundary layer
humidity forecasts show stratus /IFR-MVFR/ to 18z then mixing out
to VFR for the remainder of the morning to the afternoon. Otherwise
stratus ceiling /IFR/ redevelops 07z-09z tonight vicinity KOAK. Low
confidence stratus ceiling /IFR/ redevelops vicinity KSJC by the
end of the current 12z TAF forecast.

Monterey Bay Terminals...Stratus and fog /LIFR-IFR/ lifting to
MVFR between 16z-17z then to VFR 18z today. Stratus /IFR/
redevelops this evening and is forecast tonight and Sunday
morning. Light southeast winds becoming northwest by late morning
and early afternoon, winds light and variable tonight and Sunday
morning.

.MARINE...
(Today through Thursday)
Issued at 348 AM PST Sat Feb 7 2026

Light to gentle northwest winds prevail across the coastal waters
today while light southwest winds develop over the far outer
waters north of Point Reyes. Seas mainly moderate through Sunday
before slightly increasing early next week. A cold front gradually
moves southeastward over the coastal waters and bays Sunday and
Sunday  night resulting in an increase in north-northwesterly
winds Monday and Tuesday.

.BEACHES...
Issued at 205 AM PST Sat Feb 7 2026

A High Surf Advisory remains in effect today at all Pacific Coast
beaches, through 9 PM Saturday. Westerly swell will bring an
increased risk for sneaker waves and strong rip currents with
breaking waves 17 to 22 feet.

Remember to stay off of jetties, piers, rocks, and other waterside
infrastructure, remain out of the water, and never turn your back
on the ocean!

&&

.MTR WATCHES/WARNINGS/ADVISORIES...
CA...High Surf Advisory until 9 PM PST this evening for CAZ006-505-
     509-529-530.

PZ...Small Craft Advisory until 9 AM PST this morning for Pigeon Pt
     to Pt Pinos 10-60 NM-Pt Pinos to Pt Piedras Blancas 0-10 nm.

     Small Craft Advisory from 3 PM to 9 PM PST Sunday for Pt Pinos
     to Pt Piedras Blancas 0-10 nm.
