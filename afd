.UPDATE...
Issued at 838 AM PDT Wed Jul 30 2025

A Tsunami Advisory remains in effect for the Bay Area and Central
Coast until further notice with tidal stations along our coastline
continuing to see fluctuations of greater than one foot. Do not go
to the coast! Stay away from the water! Warmer and drier conditions
continue with temperatures ranging from below normal to seasonal
within the marine layer and seasonal to slightly above normal in the
higher elevations above the marine layer. No major changes to the
overall forecast.

.SHORT TERM...
Issued at 158 AM PDT Wed Jul 30 2025
(Today and tonight)

A weak upper level shortwave trough will continue to shift inland
across the Bay Area and Central Coast through the morning hours.
Steady, onshore zonal flow will set in behind the trough for the
remainder of the work week. Low stratus clouds will linger most if
not all day for many of our coastal areas with reduced mixing under
the zonal flow aloft, and ample sunshine for inland areas away from
the influence of the marine layer. Expect breezy onshore winds along
the coast during the afternoon and evening hours with relatively
light winds inland. When low stratus returns this evening it will
penetrate a little farther inland than previous couple nights as the
marine layer begins to increase and expand.

&&

.LONG TERM...
Issued at 158 AM PDT Wed Jul 30 2025
(Thursday through Tuesday)

Reposted from previous forecast: Upper-level troughing to the north
will drive steady onshore flow dominating our weather pattern
through the first days of August, leading to a stable forecast with
temperatures remaining near or slightly below the seasonal average,
combined with cloudy mornings giving way to breezy afternoons and
evenings. Towards the latter half of the week, increased moisture
from a low currently near the Gulf of Alaska could result in
enhanced overnight and morning stratus coverage, but aside from
that, there would be no other changes to sensible weather impacts
for the 7 day forecast period.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 356 AM PDT Wed Jul 30 2025

Currently a mixed bag of IFR-MVFR at the terminals with a marine
layer of about 1,400 feet. Very brief VFR will likely be achieved by
all terminals this afternoon with low stratus sticking close to the
coast.

Vicinity of SFO...Currently IFR with westerly flow. Moderate
confidence on the terminal becoming VFR by this afternoon, but high
confidence on if it does that it will be brief. Westerly winds will
prevail through the TAF period.

SFO Bridge Approach...Low stratus clouds will likely linger between
OAK, SFO, and northward with only moderate confidence on either
terminal improving to VFR.

Monterey Bay Terminals...Currently IFR with westerly flow at both
terminals. Moderate confidence on very brief VFR this afternoon with
stratus sticking close to the coast. Westerly winds will prevail
through the TAF period.

.MARINE...
(Today through Monday)
Issued at 356 AM PDT Wed Jul 30 2025

A Tsunami Advisory is in effect for the Bay Area and Central Coast
due to an 8.8 magnitude earthquake off the coast of Russia. Fresh
to strong northwesterly breezes and moderate to rough seas will
prevail through Sunday.

.BEACHES...
Issued at 158 AM PDT Wed Jul 30 2025

A Tsunami Advisory is in effect for the Bay Area and Central Coast
due to an 8.8 magnitude earthquake off the coast of Russia. Stay
away from the coast! Stay away from beaches and waterways! Remain
away from shore until local officials tell you it is okay to
return.

Remember!

- A tsunami is a series of waves carrying a large mass of water.
  This will NOT be a single wave and the first wave will NOT
  necessarily be the biggest.

- Even if wave heights are low, dangerous and powerful currents
  are possible in the ocean and at the beach.

- Do NOT try to go to the coast to take photos! You will not just
  put yourself at risk, you will put the people who have to rescue
  you at risk.
