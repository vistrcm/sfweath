...New AVIATION, MARINE...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 121 AM PDT Wed Mar 20 2024

Coastal stratus and patchy fog will are expected Wednesday and
Thursday morning before a cold front brings rain Fri-Sat and
cooler temperatures through the weekend.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 121 AM PDT Wed Mar 20 2024

High resolution model soundings and regional profilers are showing
a reorganizing marine layer. While the thermodynamics look
similar to Tuesday morning, the coastal stratus is not as
extensive, likely due to higher surface winds. A weak cold front
will approach the Pacific Northwest today. Ridging high pressure
from the SW will be the more dominant feature over the Bay Area,
but the existence of the cold front will be apparent with
increased cirrus expected this evening. These clouds should keep
the temperature a few degrees cooler than yesterday, but still
above average for most areas, particularly in the window after the
morning stratus mixes out and before the high-level frontal
clouds arrive. If nothing else, the cirrus should make for a good
sunset this evening.

.LONG TERM...
(Thursday through Tuesday)
Issued at 121 AM PDT Wed Mar 20 2024

Thursday will be the last dry day with cloud cover increasing
ahead of Friday`s cold front. These clouds will keep the
temperature a couple degrees cooler than earlier in the week, but
with light winds, it will still be a pleasant day. A cold front
arrives Friday, moving from N to S. Southerly winds ahead of the
front will gradually increase through the day in conjunction with
steady, light to moderate rain. While a few very light pre-
frontal showers may begin as early as Thursday, rain will begin in
earnest Friday morning in the North Bay, and Friday afternoon
along the Central Coast. As the front passes, winds will shift to
westerly and the steady rain will gradually transition to hit-or-
miss showers on Saturday. Some of these showers may be strong, and
with cooler air aloft, there is a slight chance for
thunderstorms to develop. Showers will taper off Sunday, but the
cooler temperatures look to persist into the middle of next week.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 512 AM PDT Wed Mar 20 2024

VFR to LIFR conditions. Fog has developed at STS and SNS with
moderate to high confidence that fog will linger at STS through the
mid morning. Guidance indicates fog will start to clear out of STS
between 17-18Z but looking at persistence suggests some potential
for clearing to occur as late as 20Z. For SNS, higher likelihood of
fog development continues through the mid morning but there is
moderate confidence that any fog that develops will be temporary
with low level stratus prevailing. Elsewhere, widespread MVFR to IFR
low level stratus will persist through the mid morning hours before
VFR conditions return during the late morning/early afternoon. Mix
of light, variable onshore and offshore winds overnight before
transitioning to moderate onshore winds during the day.

Vicinity of SFO...MVFR continuing through the mid morning before VFR
returns. Low to moderate confidence that MVFR conditions will
persist through 18Z. Guidance was initially split on if stratus
would reach SFO however despite stratus reaching SFO around 11Z
night fog is showing stratus starting recede away from SFO. Given
model uncertainty, it is possible that stratus may dissipate before
18Z with an earlier return of VFR possible depending on how far the
stratus bank recedes. Currently moderate onshore winds expecting to
transition to light, variable winds toward the end of the TAF period.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...LIFR conditions expected through mid
morning with VFR returning by the late morning hours. Low level
stratus has moved into both MRY and SNS with temporary dense fog
possible at SNS through the morning hours. Night fog shows stratus
moving further into the Monterey Peninsula and pulling away slightly
from MRY. Temporary improvements from LIFR to VFR are possible at
MRY as stratus briefly scatters out but these breaks are expected to
be short lived with broken to overcast conditions prevailing. Light
offshore flow will continue through the mid morning before moderate
onshore winds return during the day.

.MARINE...
(Today through Monday)
Issued at 512 AM PDT Wed Mar 20 2024

Light to moderate northwest to westerly winds continue across the
northern and central coastal waters with gustier winds across the
southern coastal waters, particularly from Point Pinos to Point
Piedras Blancas, through Thursday morning. An approaching low
pressure system will bring increased rain chances, breezier
westerly to southerly winds, and slightly elevated wave heights
beginning late Thursday lasting through Saturday afternoon. A
moderate period northwesterly swell continues to diminish with a
new, longer period northwesterly swell train arriving Thursday.

&&

.MTR WATCHES/WARNINGS/ADVISORIES...
CA...None.
PZ...Small Craft Advisory until 3 AM PDT Thursday for Pt Pinos to Pt
     Piedras Blancas 0-10 nm.
