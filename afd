...New AVIATION...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 246 AM PDT Sun Aug 27 2023

Building high pressure will lead to less night and morning clouds
with warmer daytime temperatures. The warmest days will be Tuesday
and Wednesday, especially away from the coast. Cooler weather
returns by next weekend.

&&

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 246 AM PDT Sun Aug 27 2023

Satellite imagery overnight showing a much more diffuse and broken
up marine layer compare to previous nights thanks to building
high pressure aloft. Some of the profilers even hint at weak
offshore flow around 1200 feet, which may be helping in breaking
of the marine layer clouds. Even with less cloud cover stratus is
still impacting some of the coastal areas and inland valleys.
Given the compressed nature of the marine layer automated sensors
are showing reducing visibilities with haze and some patchy fog.

For today - morning clouds will erode before noon giving way to
mainly sunny skies for most of the Bay Area and Central Coast.
Some patchy low clouds may hug the coast into the afternoon.
Regardless, building high pressure and a warming airmass over the
region will result in warmer temperatures today. 24 hour trends
this afternoon will show many interior location 3-5 degrees warmer
than Saturday. Highs at the coast will be upper 60s to lower 80s
and 80s to mid 90s interior.

One other item of note today will be the winds, especially along
the coast and coastal waters. N-S gradient continue to increase
resulting in increasing winds. Buoy 28 (off Central Coast) is
already showing gust of 27 kts. Hi-res models showing a solid
coastal jet developing this afternoon just S of Point Sur.
Probabilistic guidance shows a 70-90% of winds exceeding 35 kts
by Sunday afternoon.

For tonight - even with building high pressure the marine layer
will return with another night of broken up stratus. Above the
marine layer will be mild with lows in the 60s and 70s in the
hills.

.LONG TERM...
(Monday through Saturday)
Issued at 332 AM PDT Sun Aug 27 2023

The long term forecast will feature rising temperatures and then
falling temperatures. High pressure over the Desert SW will
continue to build westward Monday and peak Tuesday/Wednesday.
While 500mb heights and 850mb temps both rise they are not that
impressive for a big "heat event". Regardless of full potential,
temperatures are still forecast to reach the triple digits by
Tuesday/Wednesday for the warmest inland locations. Coastal areas
will also warm, but lingering onshore flow will keep temperatures
in check. Here`s a look at some temperature probabilities for a
few interior locations: Temps GTE 90 deg...KSTS 97%, KLVK 92%,
KSJC 53%, Gilroy 98%. Temps GTE 100 deg...KSTS 5%, KLVK 26%, KSJC
0%, Gilroy 58%. In addition to the warm/hot daytime temperatures
overnight lows will be mild, especially in the hills. Even though
HeatRisk only reaches the Moderate category for Tuesday/Wednesday
heat safety precautions should be taken. The warm up will be
short-lived as the ridge weakens as an upper level trough moves
through far NorCal. Cooler temperatures return by next weekend
with a deeper marine layer.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 435 AM PDT Sun Aug 27 2023

Widespread MVFR/IFR CIGs are affecting all TAF sites with weak
winds and a few areas of fog around the North Bay and around the
Monterey Bay. Cloud cover thins in the late morning/early
afternoon leading to widespread VFR with light winds becoming
moderate to gusty that afternoon. Cloud cover will struggle to
move inland into Sunday night. Leading to only a few areas of CIGs
into Monday morning.

Vicinity of SFO...Inconsistent IFR CIGs last through the morning.
Winds stay moderate until the afternoon. VFR returns in the mid
morning with westerly winds becoming gusty for the afternoon.
These winds reduce into Sunday night but will stay breezy until
the late night.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...LIFR, light winds, and reduced
visibility last through much of the morning. VFR returns Sunday
afternoon with moderate westerly winds. These winds linger into
the night before becoming light again.

.MARINE...
(Today through Friday)
Issued at 246 AM PDT Sun Aug 27 2023

Breezy northwest winds continue with coastal jets setting up
along favored portions of the coastline in the afternoon, bringing
localized stronger gusts. Stronger gusts develop early next week
with gale force gusts possible across much of the coastal waters
through midweek. These strong winds and subsequent steep wind
waves will create hazardous seas. A mix of moderate period (13-15
seconds) southerly swell and shorter period, light northerly swell
continues through the middle of the work week next week.
