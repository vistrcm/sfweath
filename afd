...New AVIATION...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 300 AM PDT Fri May 26 2023

Unseasonably cool conditions to persist into at least early next
week. Widespread night and morning low clouds will give way to
inland clearing each afternoon. The longer range outlook shows
this pattern will likely carry into early June

&&

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 300 AM PDT Fri May 26 2023

Persistence. A mid/upper level trough persists over the state
this morning with stratus filling in over much of the Bay Area and
Central Coast. This has resulted in temperatures in the mid/low
50s once again this morning. Patchy drizzle is also being reported
near the coast and in the upslope regions of the East Bay Hills.
However, there are fewer locations reporting measurable (>0.01)
precipitation compared to previous morning. This is likely due to
a slight inland shift of the trough axis and weaker moist upslope
flow this morning. That said, mist and drizzle is still expected
through the morning hours with a deep marine layer in place.
Temperatures this afternoon will largely depend on clearing of
stratus with upper 50s to lower 60s near the coast and mid/upper
60s to lower 70s inland. With very little change in the pattern
aloft, look for low clouds to return back inland overnight into
Saturday morning.

.LONG TERM...
(Saturday through Thursday)
Issued at 300 AM PDT Fri May 26 2023

More of the same expected heading into the holiday weekend as
troughing over the West Coast is reinforced by yet another
mid/upper level low. As the center of an upper level low tracks
southward over the region late Saturday into Sunday, it may work
to mix the marine layer enough to see more sunshine near coastal
areas. As confidence remains low at this time for this to occur,
will stick to persistence with the ebb and flow of marine stratus
each night/morning giving way to inland clearing. As such, daytime
temperatures will generally remain below seasonal averages. As
previously stated, beachgoers are reminded to never turn their
back to the ocean. Additionally, folks should be mindful that
ongoing snow melt across the Sierra are making rivers cold and
swift. Both of the aforementioned scenarios are hazardous,
especially for folks unfamiliar with their dangers.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 431 AM PDT Fri May 26 2023

MVFR cigs Friday morning, locally IFR in the North Bay. Patchy
drizzle, but no major impacts expected. Moderate confidence for
stratus clouds to hold on through 19Z, but low confidence on exact
timing between 19Z-21Z. VFR Friday afternoon before clouds move
in once again. Coastal areas are forecast to start having cloud
impacts around 03Z, with interior areas after 06Z. The North Bay
will once again have a chance for IFR, and there are increasing
chances for IFR around the Monterey Peninsula as well overnight
Friday into Saturday morning.

Vicinity of SFO...MVFR. Most uncertainty surrounds clearing time
to VFR. Originally had 21Z in 06Z and brought it back to 20Z. Low
confidence on exact timing, but higher confidence through at least
19Z. VFR and a seabreeze before clouds return Friday evening. MVFR
conditions expected after 06Z.

SFO Bridge Approach...Clouds between 1700 and 2400 feet cover the
South Bay. Clearing for the approach not forecast until around
20Z.

Monterey Bay Terminals...MVFR cigs through 18Z, with coastal areas
with the chance for keeping clouds through 20Z. After a brief
period of time with a seabreeze and VFR conditions, clouds return
after 03Z with increasing odds for IFR conditions.

.MARINE...
(Today through Wednesday)
Issued at 300 AM PDT Fri May 26 2023

Generally light to moderate northwest winds expected over the
coastal waters through the upcoming weekend. Meanwhile, breezy to
gusty westerly winds will develop across the San Francisco Bay,
San Pablo Bay, Suisun Bay, the West Delta each afternoon. A series
of long period southerly swells will also persist in the
background into early next week.
