.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 155 AM PST Tue Dec 5 2023

Dense fog is being reported across the North Bay interior valleys
and SF Bay. Fog is expected to spread south and will impact more
of the bay shoreline and Santa Clara valley by sunrise, thus Dense
Fog Advisories are in effect until 11 AM. Nice and warm
conditions are expected by the afternoon today. Rain is on track
to arrive early Wednesday morning, bringing beneficial rain to the
region. Cold morning temperatures expected at the end of the
week.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 155 AM PST Tue Dec 5 2023

Night fog GOES satellite imagery reveals fog formation across the
North Bay valleys and the SF Bay and adjacent shorelines with
high clouds over the Pacific NW/NorCal that are associated with a
strong parent low pressure system over the Gulf of Alaska. Weak
flow at the lower levels under influence of high pressure, clear
skies, and a relatively moist boundary layer have resulted in
ideal conditions for dense fog formation across the Bay Area.
Current observations show visibilities at a quarter statute miles
or less across the NB valleys. Fog is spreading south over the SF
Bay with Oakland airport reporting 3/4 statute miles. Fog is
expected to continue to spread and drift south affecting more of
the bay shoreline as well as the Santa Clara Valley later in the
morning hours.

Dense fog will result in dangerous driving conditions, especially
for the morning commute. Be sure to use caution, use your low
beams, and give yourself plenty of distance from other vehicles.
Since we are in winter and the sun angle is lower (ie less
incoming solar radiation to penetrate the fog), dense fog may
linger longer through the morning, which is supported by hi
resolution guidance. As such, Dense Fog Advisories for the NB
valleys, the SF Bay shoreline, the Santa Clara Valley, and the SF
Peninsula coastline are set to expire at 11 AM this morning.

Once the fog dissipates by late morning and visibilities improve,
it`s expected to be a rather pleasant day across the region with
warmer than average temperatures. Highs will be in the upper 60s
to mid 70s, running about 10 degrees above climatological
normals for much of the region.

If planning to go to the beach, be sure to use caution still as the
surf zone remains active and turbulent with large northwest swells
moving through the coastal CA waters. See BEACHES section below
for more detailed info.

.LONG TERM...
(Wednesday through Monday)
Issued at 155 AM PST Tue Dec 5 2023

A weaker perturbation (and associated cold front) off the
aforementioned parent low will dip into the Bay Area late Tuesday
into early Wed, bringing our next round of rain. Rain is expected
starting early Wednesday across the North Bay, spreading south and
east through the early afternoon. The NBM has trended slightly
wetter with forecasted rainfall amounts with the North Bay
expected to receive about 1/3 inch up to 3/4 inch in the valleys,
while south of the Golden Gate and the East Bay will generally see
0.25 to up to a half an inch. The further south and inland you go
towards the Central Coast, less rain is expected (510-513.

     High Surf Advisory from 7 PM this evening to 4 AM PST Thursday
     for CAZ006-505-509-530.

     Beach Hazards Statement from this evening through late Wednesday
