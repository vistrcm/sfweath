...New AVIATION...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 1223 AM PST Sat Dec 9 2023

High pressure will bring quiet weather over the next several days.
Cold overnights and interior frost/freezing conditions are
expected this weekend before a gradual warming trend occurs early
next week.

&&

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 1223 AM PST Sat Dec 9 2023

The storm track will be diverted well to our north as high pressure
aloft noses into our area from the southwest. This will support
surface ridging as it expands to encompass the Great Basin and
provide a light offshore wind regime to the area. After a cold and
frosty (for some) start this morning look for temperatures to reach
the lower to mid 60s across the region today with plenty of
sunshine. Tonight will be cool, but not quite as cold as the
previous nights have been. That said, the coldest portions of the
inland Central Coast and North Bay valleys will still see
temperatures at or below 35 degrees or so. Therefore the Freeze
Watch was converted to a Frost Advisory for these areas from late
tonight into Sunday morning. Remember to protect people, pets,
plants and pipes from the cold.

&&

.LONG TERM...
(Sunday through Friday)
Issued at 1223 AM PST Sat Dec 9 2023

Relatively quiet weather will prevail for the remainder of the week
with gradually warming daytime temperatures. Overnight readings will
remain cool however with the coldest interior locations dipping into
the upper 30s and 40s. Daytime highs will be mostly in the 60s.

Looking ahead deterministic models and their ensembles suggest a
more unsettled pattern developing around December 16th-18th. Still
some fine tuning of the details but it does appear that rain will re-
enter the forecast picture around this time.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 329 AM PST Sat Dec 9 2023

High pressure dominates the pattern. The terminals will remain
mostly VFR with few to scattered high clouds and light to gentle
winds through the day. The only exception is STS, where some
morning mist/fog will reduce the visibility to MVFR/IFR. It`s
also worth noting that the temperature is approaching freezing and
some aircraft icing is expected before the mist/fog clears after
sunrise. There is also a low to moderate chance for dense fog and
LIFR conditions to develop at STS later this morning.

Vicinity of SFO...VFR through the TAF period. Light winds may shift
erratically with no discernible steering flow through mid day. A
gentle NW sea breeze will develop in the afternoon before winds
return to light and variable Sat night.

SFO Bridge Approach... Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals... VFR through the TAF period. Light drainage
flow this morning before onshore flow resumes in the afternoon.

&&

.MARINE...
(Tonight through next Wednesday)
Issued at 301 AM PST Sat Dec 9 2023

High pressure will bring quiet and dry conditions to the region.
Light to moderate northerly breezes persist through the weekend
with diminishing seas. Fresh to strong breezes return to the
offshore waters by early to mid next week.

&&
