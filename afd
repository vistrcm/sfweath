.SHORT TERM...
Issued at 1208 AM PDT Sun Sep 7 2025
(Today and tonight)

Patchy marine layer stratus is filling in this morning under a
full moon. The pattern today is dominated by the interaction
between weak ridging over northern Mexico and an approaching
trough off the coast. Dry air at 925 mb will gradually filter out
over the next 24 hours, but will continue to impact the low cloud
cover through the majority of the day today. Despite the increased
sunshine, 850 mb temperatures are below normal and will keep
surface temperatures around 5 degrees cooler than normal, similar
to yesterday. Marine layer clouds will roll back in tonight with
more and earlier coverage than the last couple nights as the dry
air filters out.

.LONG TERM...
Issued at 1208 AM PDT Sun Sep 7 2025
(Monday through Saturday)

Monday will bring a significant pattern change. The 500 mb trough
will approach the immediate coast with surface low pressure off
Northern California and an associated cold front extending SW into
the Eastern Pacific. This pattern will bring SW winds and high
moisture ahead of the cold front. As the front moves through and
lifts this air mass, light rain is possible beginning Monday
morning in the North Bay and pushing south through the day. Any
accumulation will be low, with up to 1/10th expected in the North
Bay and only some novelty drops further south. After the front
moves through, 500 mb temperatures will drop to around -15C late
Tuesday, which is in the bottom 10th percentile for this time of
year. It looks like the moisture will survive frontal passage,
and the PW is expected to remain above 150% of normal through
Wednesday. Combined with daytime heating, surface based
instability could be triggered Tuesday through Thursday, with the
best chance Wednesday afternoon. Expect some cumulus clouds, with
an outside chance for showers or thunderstorms. By Thursday the
instability will decrease and shower chances diminish.
