.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 1224 AM PDT Sat Sep 28 2024

A pleasant weekend will be followed by hot, dry weather next week.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 1224 AM PDT Sat Sep 28 2024

Clear skies are observed around the Bay Area, with a southerly
surge of low clouds and fog moving up the Big Sur coast into the
Monterey Bay this morning. These clouds will not last beyond mid-
morning. The ridge is breaking down as a mid-level low near the
Channel Islands connects with weak troughing to the north. As a
result, the Ft. Ord profiler is showing the marine layer
rebounding to near 1,000 ft tonight. This will help bring the
temperature down this weekend. Overall it will be a nice day
across the cwa with cooler temperatures, light onshore wind, and
plenty of sunshine.

.LONG TERM...
(Sunday through Friday)
Issued at 1224 AM PDT Sat Sep 28 2024

Sunday will be pretty similar to Saturday. Cool coastal
temperatures, light onshore wind and plenty of sunshine. There is
a better chance for a foggy start in the North Bay and San Mateo
Peninsula.

The big story this week is the drastic warm-up arriving Monday.
The cut-off low will weaken and move inland through the day
Sunday, allowing the East Pacific High to extend a ridge across
the Bay Area. This pattern will support a weak NNE offshore wind
regime that will bring hot, dry weather all the way to the coast.
Tuesday looks like the hottest day with inland temps passing the
100 degree mark or 20 degrees above normal. Even coastal cities
like San Francisco and Santa Cruz could see the thermometer flirt
with 90 degrees on Tuesday afternoon. This event will last from
Monday - Wednesday, with a distinct peak on Tuesday. The
temperature will cool later in the week, but it`s looking more
likely that the first half of October will stay above average.

Of course when we mention off-shore winds, we have to address
fire weather concerns. While the hot, dry weather will push live
and dead fuels to critical levels, the actual wind speed doesn`t
look very strong. As such, we are unlikely to issue any red flag
warnings for this event. Nevertheless, fires will be easier to
start and spread during the first half of the week.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 456 AM PDT Sat Sep 28 2024

Stratus has begun to impact Monterey Bay terminals, bringing LIFR
conditions as fog and low CIGs persist. Elsewhere, conditions are
VFR and expected to remain clear through at least the early evening.
Winds will increase in the afternoon today to become onshore and
breezy. Stratus begins to encroach on area terminals in the evening,
initially bringing IFR/MVFR CIGs.

Vicinity of SFO...VFR through the TAF period. Clear skies will
prevail, with winds increasing out of the NW this afternoon to
around 15 knots. In the late evening, winds will begin to decrease
and FEW-SCT low clouds will drift over the terminal as stratus
begins to push in through the Golden Gate gap. However, not
expecting CIG development at SFO within the current TAF period.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...Stratus this morning is impacting KSNS
terminal, bringing LIFR conditions. Stratus is expected to begin
impacting KMRY within the hour, as satellite currently shows stratus
curling around and beginning to encircle KMRY. KMRY is likely to see
LIFR conditions last through at least 16-17Z, afterwards clearing to
VFR. VFR will only be through the early evening, as stratus is
expected to make an aggressive push inland, ushering in IFR
conditions. CIGs will then lower through the overnight of Saturday
into Sunday to become LIFR.

.MARINE...
(Today through Thursday)
Issued at 456 AM PDT Sat Sep 28 2024

Moderate northwesterly winds continue over the waters through much
of the weekend, but increase to become strong late Sunday. Over
the far northern outer waters, gusts may become near-gale force on
Sunday, but begin to diminish Monday. Significant wave heights
will build to 8 to 13 feet over the outer waters and portions of
the northern inner waters by late this weekend. Given elevated
wave heights and wind gusts, rough seas will persist over the
outer waters through the end of the forecast period.

.MTR WATCHES/WARNINGS/ADVISORIES...
CA...None.
PZ...Small Craft Advisory until 9 PM PDT Sunday for Pigeon Pt to Pt
     Pinos 10-60 NM-Pt Arena to Pt Reyes 0-10 nm-Pt Arena to Pt
