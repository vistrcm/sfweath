...New AVIATION...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 239 AM PDT Mon Oct 7 2024

Warm again today, but temperatures are on the decline this week.
Excessive Heat Warnings have been downgraded to Heat Advisories
inland, and the Heat Advisory along the coast is no longer in
effect.

&&

.UPDATE...
Issued at 853 AM PDT Mon Oct 7 2024

Radar and satellite still picking up on precipitation at around
10,000 feet across the coastal waters and North Bay region. We have
had reports some reached the surface this morning, but generally
just sprinkles. The probability of any lightning remains ~5%
throughout this afternoon. The ongoing forecast remains on track
with no updates anticipated this morning. Please see the forecast
discussion below for more on the heat expected today.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 239 AM PDT Mon Oct 7 2024

Temperatures across lower elevations are running a couple of
degrees warmer than this time yesterday morning. This may lead to
a slight increase in the temperature forecast for today. However,
the good news is that temps at higher elevations are running a few
degrees cooler than 24 hours ago. This is our hint that lower
level temps in the atmosphere are beginning to gradually cool,
which should lead us on our journey of ending this heat wave over
these next couple of days. 500 mb heights are expected to begin
falling today as a weak shortwave trough around a broader
circulation moves through the region. Temperatures today would
likely fall off more quickly this evening as onshore flow is
restored.

Moderate HeatRisk persists today across much of the region away
from the coastline, with some isolated areas of major in the
interior East Bay, Santa Cruz Mtns, North Bay Mtns, and Eastern
Santa Clara Hills. As such, and with the higher confidence of
deeper onshore flow this evening, all Excessive Heat Warnings have
been downgraded to Heat Advisories in effect until 11 PM today,
and the Heat Advisory along the coastline is no longer in effect.

.LONG TERM...
(Tuesday through Sunday)
Issued at 239 AM PDT Mon Oct 7 2024

The pattern is a little more interesting going through the rest of
this week. A deep upper low in the Gulf of Alaska is progged to
send several more vigorous shortwave troughs into the PNW with a
fairly robust moisture tap in tow. The parent upper low is progged
to dig southward along the West Coast in what looks like a fairly
typical wet-season weak cold front set up. There also seems to be
more alignment among ensemble guidance regarding the chance of
wetting rain and its timing. Once again, the chance is still low
given how far out the period is from current, and given that it`s
an early season event. However, with more members hopping on board
with the large-scale pattern shift, confidence is increasing that
we should message at least some chance of light rain Saturday for
the Bay Area and point northward.

.AVIATION...
(18Z TAFS)
Issued at 1006 AM PDT Mon Oct 7 2024

Currently VFR at all terminals. High confidence in VFR through the
TAF period at all terminals with the exception of the Monterey Bay
terminals of MRY and SNS. The sea breeze will prevail through the
TAF period.

Vicinity of SFO...Currently VFR and calm. High confidence in VFR
through the TAF period. Winds will prevail out of the west once the
sea breeze kicks in this afternoon.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...Currently VFR with northerly flow at MRY
and VFR with drainage flow at SNS. There`s up to a 35% chance in
LIFR ceilings and/or visibilities tonight from a southerly surge;
however, with a relatively unchanged pattern, confidence is low that
this will come to fruition.

.MARINE...
(Today through Saturday)
Issued at 853 AM PDT Mon Oct 7 2024

Moderate to fresh northwesterly breezes and rough seas in the
outer waters will prevail through Thursday. Friday and into the
weekend will bring renewed chances for rain as a weak cold front
moves through.
