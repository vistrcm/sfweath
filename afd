...New SYNOPSIS, SHORT TERM, LONG TERM, AVIATION, MARINE...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 325 AM PST Tue Jan 21 2025

Cold mornings will continue through much of the extended forecast
with Frost and Freeze products likely to be reissued throughout
the week. Daytime temperatures will see a slight warming trend
Tuesday through Thursday before another pattern change brings a
cooler airmass for the weekend.

&&

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 325 AM PST Tue Jan 21 2025

Upper level ridging pattern centered over coastal California will
continue to amplify and build north today and tomorrow. A weak fetch
of offshore flow near the surface will keep skies mostly clear with
light winds today and tomorrow along with gradual warming of daytime
highs, especially inland. The clear skies and light winds will allow
for radiational cooling to keep overnight lows mostly below normal
with another round of Freeze/Frost products likely for Wednesday
morning once this mornings products expire at 9 AM PST. Highs on
Wednesday will increase slightly near the coast and around 5 degrees
inland from todays values.

&&

.LONG TERM...
(Wednesday through Monday)
Issued at 325 AM PST Tue Jan 21 2025

The warming of daytime highs continues on Thursday after another
cold start. Portions of interior southern Monterey County may see
an impressive diurnal warming from the upper 20s early Thursday
morning to upper 70s in the afternoon. A disturbance over the
Pacific Northwest late Thursday into Friday begins to break down
the amplified ridging across the west, with an upper low
eventually splitting off from the Polar Jet on Saturday, then
lingering over SOCAL for the remainder of the weekend into next
week. The developing upper low will definitely bring cooler
daytime temperatures for the weekend through the remainder of the
extended forecast. Saw no need to change the slight chance PoPs
from the NBM for the weekend , as it seems to capture the weak
signal for rain/snow chances (snow chances confined to elevated
locations in S Monterey, San Benito Counties and East Bay Hills).
Widespread wetting rains are not expected, and locations fortunate
enough to see some precip should expect less than a tenth of an
inch.
