...New UPDATE, MARINE...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 223 AM PST Sat Mar 9 2024

Unsettled conditions return to the North Bay today. Light rain
chances continue into early next week. Dry and warm pattern builds
in with a strong high pressure by the end of next week.

&&

.UPDATE...
Issued at 845 AM PST Sat Mar 9 2024

Light rain is beginning to fall over the North Bay early this
morning and may make it as far south as the San Francisco
Peninsula by early afternoon before fizzling out. Rainfall amounts
are generally only a few hundredths to 0.10" an inch per hour in
the coastal ranges. The ongoing forecast remains on track with no
updates anticipated this morning.

&&

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 223 AM PST Sat Mar 9 2024

Radar just beginning to pick up on light precip over the waters
as of writing with the first in a series of weak disturbances
moving through the next few days. Overall, rain chances today look
to be confined to the North Bay and remain light, with only about
0.25" forecast for the Sonoma coastal range through tonight.
Otherwise a pleasant day ensues with mild temps. Some degree of
cloud cover across much of the area will keep temps a couple of
degrees cooler than yesterday, but highs will still be in the
low-to-mid 60s for most...upper 50s along the coast.

&&

.LONG TERM...
(Sunday through Friday)
Issued at 223 AM PST Sat Mar 9 2024

The next disturbance in the series is progged to move through late
Sunday with rain chances becoming more widespread, potentially
seeing measurable rainfall as far south as the Central Coast.
Still only looking at light amounts, about 0.5-1" in the North
Bay, 0.1-0.5" across the Bay Area, and a tenth or so along the
Central Coast. The final disturbance moves through late Monday
into Tuesday morning with light rainfall amounts basically
mirroring what will be observed Sunday.

Wednesday kicks off quite a change in the pattern with a high
amplitude ridge building over the West Coast and persisting into
next weekend. This will bring the type of weather that John and
Michelle Phillips must have been thinking of when they wrote
California Dreamin`. By the end of the week, we`ll see high temps
in the mid-to-upper 60s along the coast and mid-70s elsewhere
inland, with a few inland locations pushing near 80 degrees by the
Saturday.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 401 AM PST Sat Mar 9 2024

Widespread MVFR lasts for much of the morning with VFR returning in
the afternoon after a cold front falls apart in the North Bay. This
front will bring light rain to the North Bay, but looks to fail to
provide rain anywhere else. Expect light and variable winds through
the late morning that will become more moderate into the afternoon.
These winds linger into the evening before becoming light again.
MVFR CIGs form around the Monterey Bay into late Saturday night,
while other areas stay VFR.

Vicinity of SFO...MVFR CIGs last into the the mid-morning, then VFR
through the rest of the TAF period. Winds become moderate for the
mid to late morning before turning westerly in the afternoon as
cloud cover continues to thin. These winds become light again into
the night. Breezy southwest winds build in the mid morning on Sunday.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO

Monterey Bay Terminals...Expect MVFR CIGs to linger into the mid to
late morning before lifting. Light winds turn moderate and westerly
in the afternoon before weakening into the evening. MVFR CIGs form
around the Monterey Bay again into the late night.

.MARINE...
(Today through Thursday)
Issued at 845 AM PST Sat Mar 9 2024

A weak cold front will move through the region today bringing
light rain to the northern waters this morning. Behind the front a
moderate to large northwest swell arrives later today. Hazardous
conditions for small craft will develop Saturday night and
continue into the work week with waves between 11 to 15 feet
possible. Additional, non- impactful rains move through the waters
again Sunday and Monday.
