.UPDATE...
Issued at 920 AM PST Mon Feb 2 2026

Water vapor imagery shows a ridge of high pressure situated off the
West Coast, with predominately clear skies prevailing across the
region. While there are a few high clouds out there, they did not
limit our radiational cooling overnight and this morning or the
patchy fog formation in Sonoma. As a result, most places are
starting the day up to 4 degrees cooler this morning. The fog has
also dissipated across Sonoma. Therefore, expect another pleasant
day across the region, as temperature will once again warm into
the mid 60s and lower 70s, which is roughly 5 to 10 degrees above
normal for this time of year. Current forecast is handling these
trends well, so no update is planned at this time. Palmer

.SHORT TERM...
Issued at 920 AM PST Mon Feb 2 2026 (This afternoon through
Tuesday)

High pressure will continue to build over California through the
next 24 hours, with dry and warmer conditions prevailing.
Daytime temperatures will run between 5 and 10 degrees warmer
than normal today, and trend even warmer for Tuesday. Winds will
remain relatively again tonight, so with the predominately clear
skies prevailing, expect another good night of radiational
cooling. Expect overnight lows to be similar to or slightly warmer
than this morning. It also means that we could see some patchy
fog formation once again, especially in the North Bay.

Only other concerns for today will be with the impacts from minor
coastal flooding. While the threat will be lower than previous
days, high astronomical tide late this morning into early this
afternoon will still bring minor flooding to bayshore locations
along the San Pablo Bay in the North Bay. Hazardous beach
conditions continue at Pacific Coast beaches through this evening,
read more in the BEACHES section. Palmer

.LONG TERM...
Issued at 920 AM PST Mon Feb 2 2026 (Tuesday night through next
Sunday)

High pressure will continue to dominate the forecast through the
midweek, with the ridge axis shifting over California. As a
result, expect the warming trend to continue through midweek, with
Wednesday projected to be our warmest day of the week. Daytime
temperatures will be in the 70s to around 80 for the warmest
inland spots, while the coast will continue to see temperatures in
the mid 60s to lower 70s.

Things are starting to look more interesting for the latter part
of the work week and this weekend. A the ridge axis continues to
shift east in response to a digging trough of low pressure. At
this point in time, it looks like dry conditions will prevail
through through at least Thursday. However, things are becoming
more variable for Friday and the weekend, as the ensembles are
showing a negatively tilted trough initially setting up off the
California Coast on Friday. While it doesn`t really look like a
wet system, it doesn`t mean that we couldn`t potential see some
light rain Friday or Saturday, as this is the system that may open
the door for a better chance of rain on Sunday. While there are
still quite a few differences in the ensembles and even the
deterministic models, cannot rule out at least a slight chance of
rain, especially for Sunday. Regardless of rain chances, expect
cooler conditions to prevail with the return of onshore winds, and
some cloud cover. Palmer

.AVIATION...
(18Z TAFS)
Issued at 920 AM PST Mon Feb 2 2026

VFR conditions will continue to prevail at all taf sites today and
through most of the night, with relatively light and variable
winds, with high confidence. However, confidence is more moderate,
as there is the potential for some fog formation again tonight,
especially for STS, which would result in sub-VFR conditions.

Vicinity of SFO...VFR conditions with light southerly flow will
continue to prevail. High confidence in VFR through the TAF
period. Diurnal winds will prevail today, with offshore flow
returning tomorrow.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar as SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...Currently VFR with drainage winds at
both terminals. High confidence in VFR through the TAF period.
Diurnal winds will prevail.

.MARINE...
(Today through Saturday)
Issued at 815 AM PST Mon Feb 2 2026

Hazardous conditions will continue today for the inner waters and
outer waters due to rough seas and fresh to strong northerly
breezes. Conditions improve tomorrow as moderate seas and a gentle
northeasterly breeze prevails through Thursday. By Friday, seas
build to become rough, and northwesterly breezes increase to
become moderate once again.

&&

.BEACHES...
Issued at 257 AM PST Mon Feb 2 2026

Hazardous beach conditions will continue through this evening at
Pacific Coast beaches. Long period westerly swell will bring an
increased risk for sneaker waves and strong rip currents with
breaking waves of 14 to 19 feet. Remember: stay off of jetties,
piers, rocks, and other waterside infrastructure, remain out of
the water, and never turn your back on the ocean!
