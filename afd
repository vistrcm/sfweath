...New SHORT TERM, LONG TERM...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 357 AM PST Fri Feb 2 2024

Scattered showers continue into Saturday. Another storm system
takes aim on the region late Saturday night into Monday with
another round of heavy rain and gusty winds possible. Keep up with
forecast changes.

&&

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 357 AM PST Fri Feb 2 2024

Today offers continued shower activity through much of the day and
plenty of cloud cover. Scattered storm chances reduce into the mid
morning with only slight chances for storms into the rest of the
day. The cooler air filtering into the area along with the cloudy
conditions keeps afternoon highs in the 50s for most areas. Higher
peaks will remain on the cold side, starting the day in the mid 30s
and struggling to break into the 40s.

&&

.LONG TERM...
(Saturday through Thursday)
Issued at 357 AM PST Fri Feb 2 2024


Much of the same is expected for Saturday; showers, slight storm
chances, cloudy. Saturday evening is where we start seeing the
affects of the next storm system as shower activity and south to
southeast winds build head of the next cold front. The increases in
rain and wind will start along the Big Sur coast and spread north
and east through Saturday night.

Confidence is strong that this will be as much of a wind event as it
is a rain event. The strongest winds will favor the southern
counties of the CWA along with the San Mateo Coast, Santa Cruz Mtns,
and higher portions of the East Bay. The current forecast calls for
even stronger winds than the previous storm system specifically for
those areas. Wind Advisories and Wind warnings will go into effect
late Saturday night and last into Sunday night. Moderate to locally
heavy rains arrive along the main rain band early Sunday and become
widespread through the rest of that morning.


Unlike the previous system, the rainband focuses more along the
Central Coast, meaning Big Sur and the Santa Lucias will see the
highest rainfall amounts. Rain rates reduce into Sunday night but
light showers and slight chances for storms linger into Monday.

Updated rainfall totals for Saturday evening through Monday:


1" to 2": Santa Clara Valley, Interior East Bay

2" to 3": San Francisco, Oakland, East Bay Hills, lower elevations
of San Mateo Co, interior North Bay, interior Monterey Co, San
Benito Co

3 to 5": Santa Cruz Co, higher elevations of the North Bay, San
Mateo, San Benito, and Santa Clara counties.

5" to 7": The highest peaks of the Santa Cruz Mtns and Marin Co. The
Santa Lucias and Big Sur Coast.

Above 7": The highest peaks of the Big Sur Coast.



Showery conditions are expected to continue into the next work week
after the storm, but do not look to be impactful.
