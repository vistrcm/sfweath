...New AVIATION, MARINE...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 208 PM PDT Tue Aug 1 2023

Seasonably cool temperatures continue through midweek. High
pressure nudges closer to our region late week with above average
temperatures expected by the weekend.

&&

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 1228 AM PDT Wed Aug 2 2023

The eastward crawl of the upper level ridge over the Desert
Southwest and the upper level trough over the eastern Pacific
continues, eroding the north to south pressure gradient and
enhancing the west to east pressure gradient as a result. The marine
layer has at least maintained itself over the last day, with the
Bodega Bay profiler continuing to show a marine layer at around 1500
feet, and the Fort Ord profiler showing a marked increase of the
marine layer depth to at least 2500 feet, from a depth of around
1000 feet around 24 hours ago.

The effect of the more robust marine layer is to dramatically
increase inland stratus coverage and depth, with the stratus not
clearing out until the late morning for the interior valleys, with
the coastal regions and northern San Francisco Bay perhaps not
clearing out through the day. Temperatures will be steady for the
next couple of days, with highs ranging from the low to mid 60s
along the coast, the mid 60s to low 70s along the Bayshore, and the
upper 70s to lower 80s in the inland valleys. The most interior
portions of the region will approach or reach 90 degree highs. Lows
will generally be in the low to mid 50s, except down to the upper
40s in the interior valleys of Monterey and San Benito counties, and
up to the low 60s for the most elevated mountains that remain above
the marine layer stratus. With the pattern unchanged for the next
couple of days, have retained drizzle across the coastal areas from
San Francisco down to Point Sur for the rest of the night, and have
added drizzle for the same areas for Wednesday night into early
Thursday morning.

.LONG TERM...
(Thursday through Tuesday)
Issued at 1228 AM PDT Wed Aug 2 2023

Zonally elongated subtropical ridging should nudge northwest towards
our area this weekend as upstream troughing weakens. This will bring
a compressed marine layer along with warming temperatures. The
typical hot spots inland should see temperatures peaking in the 90s
to lower 100s. This will produce a moderate HeatRisk so make sure to
practice heat safety. The warmup will be rather muted along the
coast however with onshore winds and the persistent marine layer.
Expect the warmup to be rather short-lived as a weakness develops in
the ridge towards mid next week. This will bring gradually cooling
temperatures for the remainder of the forecast period.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 420 AM PDT Wed Aug 2 2023

IFR-MVFR stratus blanketing the majority of the region save the high
elevations and the most interior of the East Bay valleys.
Widespread clearing expected around 17-19Z, but the main SF Bay
and Monterey Bay terminals might not clear out for a couple more
hours, if at all. Probabilities for continued stratus ceilings
currently stand at 20-30% for SFO and 40-50% for OAK and MRY.
Breezy and locally gusty northwesterly flow will develop this
afternoon, with speeds up to 15- 20 knots at the terminals.
Stratus returns early tonight, coverage starting to build around
01-02Z and continuing expansion through the end of the 24-hour TAF
period.

Vicinity of SFO...MVFR-IFR through the rest of the night. Clearing
has trended later for the most recent model output, with some
uncertainty in clearing time. Model output shows clearing time now
around 20-22Z, with a low confidence (20-30% probability) that SFO
remains clouded over for the day. Westerly winds developing this
afternoon, gusting to 30 knots. Will monitor potential for gusts up
to 35 knots through the afternoon. Stratus builds back around 04Z,
with the ceilings continuing through the end of the TAF period, when
some model output is currently hinting at clearing.

SFO Bridge Approach...Greater confidence that the approach
path clears out during the day. Otherwise similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...IFR-MVFR ceilings through the night. SNS
clears out at 19-20Z with a moderate confidence (50-60% probability)
that MRY clears out for a couple hours around 21-02Z. Westerly winds
up to 10-15 knots during the afternoon and evening hours. IFR
stratus builds back up as winds diminish by the late afternoon and
continues through the end of the TAF period.

.MARINE...
(Today through Monday)
Issued at 416 AM PDT Wed Aug 2 2023

High pressure over the Eastern Pacific maintains moderate
northwesterly flow across the coastal waters through the next
week. Persistent northwest winds continue to generate short
period wind waves. The predominant northwest wind wave with
periods of around 8 seconds will be coupled with a longer period
southerly swell.
