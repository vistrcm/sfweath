...New UPDATE, MARINE...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 218 AM PDT Wed Sep 4 2024

Building high pressure will continue to support widespread moderate
HeatRisk and near critical fire weather conditions through Thursday.
A gradual cooling trend kicks off Friday as upper-level troughing
takes shape off the West Coast.

&&

.UPDATE...
Issued at 907 AM PDT Wed Sep 4 2024

Satellite imagery shows stratus generally confined to the
immediate coast, coming inland across the Monterey Bay region where
the clouds continue to mix out through the morning. The forecast
for hot and dry conditions remains on track with the Heat Advisory
currently in effect for the City of San Francisco, and expected
to come into effect later this morning for the interior regions.
For more details, see the previous discussion.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 218 AM PDT Wed Sep 4 2024

What a difference a day makes, temperatures are upwards of 20
degrees warmer and relative humidities are upwards of 60% drier than
this time 24 hours ago. High pressure will continue to build today
resulting in further warming and drying. Maximum temperatures will
be 10-20 degrees above normal with widespread moderate HeatRisk.
Near critical fire weather conditions will continue due to poor
relative humidity recoveries across interior locations and higher
elevations. Across higher elevations, light northerly/offshore flow
will continue through the morning with a return of onshore flow by
this afternoon.

High pressure and subsequent subsidence aloft supports a
compressed/shallow marine layer with reduced visibility and that is
evident along the coast. Patchy fog will impact Highway 1 through
the morning so be sure to slow down, allow extra time to reach your
destination, and use your low-beams.

.LONG TERM...
(Thursday through Tuesday)
Issued at 218 AM PDT Wed Sep 4 2024

Thursday will be very similar to today with widespread moderate
HeatRisk and elevated fire weather conditions across interior
locations and higher elevations. Interior Monterey and San Benito
Counties have the potential to remain 10-20 degrees above normal
Friday; therefore, the Heat Advisory may need to be extended into
Friday night for this area.

Come Thursday night, the upper-level pattern begins to change as
upper-level troughing begins to take shape off the West Coast. This
will result in the return of near normal to slightly below normal
temperatures by Saturday with the exception of higher elevations.

An upper-level disturbance will move through the area on Friday
posing a low chance/high impact scenario. At this time chances for
thunderstorms are less than 5% with the greatest chances (10-20%) in
the Sierra. If a thunderstorm were to develop in our area, it would
be high-based convection with the primary threats being dry
lightning and gusty outflows. The atmosphere in our area just does
not look to stack up in terms of instability and moisture coinciding
at the same place and the same time.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 438 AM PDT Wed Sep 4 2024

VFR continues north of the Monterey Bay with patchy fog and low
stratus along the coastline from the Bay Area down to Santa Cruz.
LIFR/VFR ceilings will persist over the Monterey Bay terminals
through at least midmorning.

Vicinity of SFO...VFR is expected to persist through the day and
evening hours with a low chance of low stratus ceilings developing
later tonight. Low stratus is currently in vicinity of the KSFO
and KOAK but not expected to impact the terminals.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...Light onshore winds with low stratus and
areas of fog (LIFR/IFR) will continue through much of the morning
but is expected to retreat back to the coastline by mid/late
morning.

&&

.MARINE...
(Today through Monday)
Issued at 907 AM PDT Wed Sep 4 2024

Light winds will continue over the coastal waters and bays as
surface high pressure builds over the Pacific Northwest through
Thursday. The relatively light winds will result in easing seas.
Significant sea heights remain at or below 6 to 7 feet through the
early part of next week.

&&

.FIRE WEATHER...
Issued at 900 PM PDT Tue Sep 3 2024

Many interior portions of the district saw triple digit heat
combined with relative humidity in the 10-20% range. Fortunately
winds were not overly strong. Nonetheless, occasional gusts did
lead to near critical fire weather conditions. Given the forecast
with additional warming and drying through at least Thursday near
critical fire weather conditions will continue. Would need winds
to ramp up a lot more to hit Red Flag conditions.

The seasonal conditions kept fuel moistures in check, but would
expect a response from these hot and dry conditions. ERC charts
are responding on the other hand with the forecast showing a trend
to more critical ranges. The Diablo/Santa Cruz grouping for
instance showing ERC values going back above the 90th percentile.
At this value large fire have to the potential to become more
frequent.

As mentioned above, will be thunderstorms chances closely on
Friday. At this point, higher confidence for thunderstorms N and
E of the district.

.MTR WATCHES/WARNINGS/ADVISORIES...

     Heat Advisory until 11 PM PDT Thursday for CAZ502>504-506-510-
