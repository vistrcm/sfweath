...New UPDATE, MARINE...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 428 AM PDT Sun Jun 2 2024

Cooler temperatures continue into Monday with coastal stratus
developing overnight. Significant warming begins Tuesday with
moderate HeatRisk across the interior regions through Thursday.

&&

.UPDATE...
Issued at 821 AM PDT Sun Jun 2 2024

Marine layer stratus is gradually mixing out across the interior
Bay Area and Central Coast, and should be pared back to the
coastal areas of the San Mateo Peninsula and Monterey County by
the afternoon. The forecast remains on track, with the main focus
still on the significant warming trend expected later this week.
For more information, see the previous discussion.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 439 AM PDT Sun Jun 2 2024

Northwest to west winds are ushering in stratus along the coast
and inland. Observations show extensively higher humidity on west
winds across much of the Bay Area and north Central Coast as the
southernmost extent of a long plume of water vapor across the
Pacific Basin reaches the Pacific NW, and is also reaching our
forecast area however without sufficient dynamics expected to
result in rain here.

Wind gusts are still reaching 45-50 mph at Altamont Pass in the
East Bay at this hour. SFO Airport peaked 46 knots /53 mph/
yesterday evening. Winds are otherwise most places gradually
lowering overnight. It`s early meteorological summer (June-August)
and still astronomical spring and depending on the larger scale
pattern it`s not uncommon for winds to get strong and gusty here
in June; surface pressure gradients strengthen via surface
temperature contrasts land (warm-hot) vs coastal water sea surface
temps (cool to chilly). Winds again becoming gusty today into the
evening, then decreasing overnight into Monday morning. Daytime
highs 60s/70s coastside and bayside, farthest inland daytime highs
today in the 80s.

.LONG TERM...
(Monday through Saturday)
Issued at 439 AM PDT Sun Jun 2 2024

A strong long wave trough exists over the North Pacific with an
extensive water vapor plume and sufficient dynamics for rain in
the Pacific NW. To the south of this, subtropical ridging over the
Pacific will strengthen during the week, noticeably beginning
Tuesday over our forecast area which will composite first with
weak long wave ridging over the western CONUS then strengthen mid
to late week. This will be in the wake of a splitting trough moving
eastward away from the Pacific NW reaching the east coast and moving
into/forming another long wave trough. The newly developing high
over the west will become nearly stationary, however there may
still be just enough eastward motion of the high to bring about a
southerly wind reversal here in our forecast area mid to late week.

Since there is good model agreement in the synoptic pattern aside
from strength differences mid to late week (the ECMWF is still
warmer to hotter with 850 mb temps over the Bay Area for example),
decided to issue a heat advisory for Tuesday and Wednesday for
inland areas. Northerly winds, downsloping and large scale
compressional warming will send temperatures upward quickly
Tuesday after sunrise (solar heating). Amplification and
additional compressional warming is quite likely mid to late week
since the high will become isolated (area of sinking motion) while
surrounded by low pressure systems (areas of upward motion).
Still a fair amount of uncertainty with the marine layer, as is
usual since it`s a very difficult thing to try to predict, given
the high level of water vapor as recently mentioned that is
forecast going into Tuesday-Wednesday. A moderate to strong ACV-SFO
pressure gradient (northerly wind) is forecast Tuesday-Wednesday
at least, there should be some drying due to downsloping across
Bay Area terrain and drying to due to compressional warming from
sinking air aloft. Stay tuned to the latest updates.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 453 AM PDT Sun Jun 2 2024

IFR across the region this morning as low stratus continues to
linger over area terminals. Late clearing to VFR is expected in the
morning today for most terminals, with winds increasing out of the
west to become strong and gusty once more this afternoon. These
stronger winds are expected to last well into the evening hours as
the SFO-SAC gradient is forecast to hover around the 4.0 mb range.
As winds ease slightly into the late night, LLWS is likely to
develop at a select few terminals as upper level winds remain
elevated. Stratus will return to most SF Bay area terminals the the
late night of Sunday to early morning of Monday, bringing MVFR/IFR
CIGs. There remains some uncertainty as to whether CIGs will lower
or lift. With troughing exiting the region, and the periphery of
ridging beginning CIG level is low confidence for late Sunday/early
Monday.

Vicinity of SFO...Currently LIFR, though expected to lift back into
IFR territory towards sunrise this morning. Clearing to VFR is
expected in the late morning near 18Z, though FEW low clouds may
linger. Winds will steadily increase into the afternoon today to
become strong and gusting above 35 knots. Strong winds last beyond
sunset, though gusts begin to diminish towards midnight. Stratus
makes a return in the evening bringing IFR CIGs.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...IFR conditions persist through the morning,
but slowly lift to become MVFR after sunrise. Clearing to VFR is
expected to be late into the afternoon and only for a few hours.
Winds will increase out of the west in the afternoon to become
breezy, and will likely usher in the return of stratus and
associated IFR CIGs in the early evening. IFR lasts well into
Monday morning.

.MARINE...
(Today through Friday)
Issued at 821 AM PDT Sun Jun 2 2024

Winds at this hour are fresh to strong, with gales having
subsided. Expect northwesterly winds to gradually diminish through
the day today to become fresh to moderate. As winds ease, wind
waves will decrease, and significant wave heights will gradually
lessen late tonight and into Monday, becoming 7 to 9 feet
generally.
