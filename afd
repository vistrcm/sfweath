...New AVIATION, MARINE...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 255 AM PDT Tue May 28 2024

Near seasonal temps inland again today with the coast remaining
cool under a well-formed marine layer. Pleasant weather continues
through the week.

&&

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 255 AM PDT Tue May 28 2024

Another day with temperatures right around seasonal averages
across inland areas. Coastal areas will still be under the
influence of a stout marine layer with cool temps in the upper
50s to near 60. Passing upper trough through the PacNW flattens
out our ridge a bit, putting a slight pause on the warming as we
move into the middle part of the week. Overall no major changes
to the short term period.

&&

.LONG TERM...
(Wednesday through Monday)
Issued at 255 AM PDT Tue May 28 2024

The cooling trend will be short-lived as the flattened ridge
begins to build back over the region with warming 850 mb temps and
rising 500 mb heights. Still looks like night/morning clouds with
inland afternoon sunshine will persist. The warming trend will
continue into this weekend with the warmest temps expected
Thursday and Friday. Far inland locations will reach the low 90s
by week`s end.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 411 AM PDT Tue May 28 2024

At this time, predominantly IFR/MVFR CIGs are impacting terminals as
a result of low clouds. Late clearing of stratus is still expected,
with VFR returning to terminals and lasting through the evening.
Into the afternoon, gusty onshore winds are expected, with gusts
generally in the 20-25 knot range, higher at SFO. Winds will be slow
to ease, with breezy conditions lingering through the end of the TAF
period. Stratus returns for a select few terminals in the night,
otherwise, expecting VFR to persist for those further inland.

Vicinity of SFO...MVFR conditions last through the late morning with
clearing to VFR, though SCT-FEW low clouds may remain. Strong winds
and gusts will steadily build in the afternoon, reaching up to
around 30-33 knots at the strongest. Into the late night, winds will
be slow to ease with gusts 20-25 knots persisting as night begins to
fall. It is not until the early morning of Wednesday that gusts are
expected to decrease, with sustained winds lowering to become
breezy. At this time, moderate confidence in maintaining VFR
through the end of the TAF period. Models hint at the return of
low clouds early Wednesday morning, though do not suggest CIGs
forming at that time.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...IFR conditions persist through the late
morning. Clearing in the late morning will bring a brief return of
VFR conditions. However, confidence in clearing at KMRY is only
moderate. This will be something to watch through the next TAF
update. Otherwise, winds increase out of the NW to become breezy
around 15 knots this afternoon, with occasional gusts closer to the
20 knot range. Stratus returns bringing IFR/MVFR CIGs in the early
evening and lasting through Wednesday morning.&&

.MARINE...
(Today through Sunday)
Issued at 411 AM PDT Tue May 28 2024

Fresh northwest winds strengthen throughout the day today to
become strong and gusty over much of the waters. These stronger
winds last through at least the late week. Occasional gale force
gusts are possible over the northern waters today and Wednesday.
These strong winds will create steep wind waves, hazardous to
small craft. Wave heights increase by the middle of the work week
to 12 to 14 feet over the outer waters.

.MTR WATCHES/WARNINGS/ADVISORIES...
CA...None.
PZ...Small Craft Advisory until 9 AM PDT Wednesday for Pigeon Pt to
     Pt Pinos 10-60 NM-Pt Arena to Pt Reyes 0-10 nm-Pt Arena to
     Pt Reyes 10-60 NM-Pt Reyes to Pigeon Pt 0-10 nm.
