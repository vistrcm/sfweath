.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 135 AM PST Sun Feb 25 2024

Fair weather conditions will continue through the weekend. A weak
system will move through on Monday, bringing light rain mainly
south of the Golden Gate. The middle of the week will be dry
before more significant rain arrives heading into next weekend.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 135 AM PST Sun Feb 25 2024

A high pressure ridge initially across the region will weaken in
response to upstream troughing across the Pacific Northwest and an
upper low approaching CA from the Pacific. Southerly low-level flow
will develop, and allow low stratus clouds to advect up the Central
Coast and into the Monterey Bay during the morning hours. Morning
stratus development may also occur over coastal portions of the Bay
Area, but confidence is lower there due to weak offshore flow and
high clouds moving in from the west. Regardless of cloud cover, a
notable drop in temperatures is expected today given the onshore
winds. Highs this afternoon will mostly be in the lower to mid 60s.
Although a few of the more inland valley locations could near 70.
Clouds thicken overnight will low temperatures dipping into the 40s.

.LONG TERM...
(Monday through Saturday)
Issued at 135 AM PST Sun Feb 25 2024

A weak weather system will impact the region on Monday. Only limited
impacts are anticipated, and rain totals have decreased. In
general accumulating precipitation appears more unlikely north of
the Golden Gate, with a tenth of an inch or less for areas to the
south. Localized amounts to around 0.25" are possible in the
Santa Lucias. Onshore winds will become a bit breezy as well with
gust to around 25 mph possible Monday evening.

High pressure will bring dry conditions, northerly winds, and cooler
temperatures for Tuesday and Wednesday. Lows Tuesday morning will be
a bit chilly, and could reach the mid 30s in the North Bay Valleys.

Conditions look rather unsettled for late week into the weekend as a
stronger storm system slowly migrates from the Gulf of Alaska
towards the West Coast. Breezy winds and hazardous marine conditions
will exist, along with periods of moderate rainfall. Storm total
amounts are holding steady from the previous forecast, with rain
spread out over several days. Global model ensemble members still
suggest rain totals around 1-2" for the lower elevations from
Thursday through Sunday, with higher amounts within the coastal
ranges. Friday and Saturday remain the target period for when the
heaviest rain amounts are expected. This is colder system and snow
levels will lower this weekend. Some ridgetop snow accumulations
are possible, with the greatest potential for this over the Santa
Lucias.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 323 AM PST Sun Feb 25 2024

VFR prevails through the TAF period, with the exception of Monterey
Bay terminals where coastal stratus will bring MVFR conditions this
morning. North Bay and SF Bay terminals this early morning will see
some low clouds filter into the vicinity, but not expecting CIGs to
develop. Confidence on this is moderate for North Bay terminals,
where models are seemingly split as to whether CIGs develop as a
result of stratus. For now, have left North Bay terminals as VFR
through the TAF. Otherwise, generally light winds through the TAF
period, becoming onshore into the afternoon today, then weakening to
become light into the nighttime hours of Sunday. High clouds build
in towards the end of the TAF period as a weak system approaches,
bringing light rain to terminals just beyond the TAF period.

Vicinity of SFO...VFR through the TAF period, though FEW low clouds
are likely to advect over the terminal. Not expecting development of
MVFR CIGs at this time. Into the afternoon, onshore winds increase
to around 9 knots and low clouds mix out. Towards the very end of
the extended TAF period, chances of light rain begin and MVFR CIGs
develop.

SFO Bridge Approach...Coastal stratus is expected to push into the
SF Bay via the Golden Gate this morning. Stratus and low clouds
likely to impact the Bridge Approach.

Monterey Bay Terminals...Satellite imagery depicts stratus pushing
into Monterey Bay at this hour. Terminals are expected to develop
MVFR CIGs shortly as stratus continues to advect inland. Into the
late morning and early afternoon today, VFR returns, though FEW to
SCT low clouds may remain. Onshore winds develop around 11 knots
this afternoon, then weaken into the night to become light.

.MARINE...
(Today through Friday)
Issued at 323 AM PST Sun Feb 25 2024

Fair weather conditions prevail through the remainder of the
weekend with winds generally light and out of the south. Come
early Monday, light rain will befall much of the southern waters,
with winds turning to become northerly and fresh into the later
part of the day. Northwesterly swell continues to move through the
waters with a period of about 12-14 seconds through Monday. Larger
NW swell begins to enter the coastal waters Tuesday.
