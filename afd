.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 1236 AM PDT Sat Apr 5 2025

Early Spring warmth will persist through the weekend with
hazardous beach conditions. A weak front will bring light rain
on Sunday for areas north of Monterey Bay. A warming trend is
expected to resume by the middle of the upcoming week as a ridge
of high pressure builds over the region.

.SHORT TERM...
Issued at 136 AM PDT Sat Apr 5 2025
(Today and tonight)

What a difference 24 hours makes from a sensible weather
perspective early Saturday morning. The longwave pattern over the
West remains the same, a highly amplified upper level ridge
extending from BC southward to well west of Baja. It`s more like
a dirty ridge as ample mid-high level stream up and over the
ridge. That`s bringing the sensible weather change, less
radiational cooling leading to warmer temperatures this morning
and less likelihood for fog. There will still be some chilly
pockets across the interior, but generally lows in the upper 30s
to near 50 seem plausible.

If you`ve got outdoor plans today you`ll love the weather
forecast. Pretty close to chamber of commerce weather across the
Bay Area and Central Coast with filtered sunshine and above normal
temperatures. The dirty ridge overhead will lead to filtered
sunshine, but temperatures are still expected to reach the 70s
away from the coast/bays. Cool marine onshore flow will
temper conditions along the coast, but 60s to near 70 isn`t too
bad either.

Tonight will be a repeat of early this morning - dirty ridge
overhead limiting radiational cooling impacts.

.LONG TERM...
Issued at 210 AM PDT Sat Apr 5 2025
(Sunday through Friday)

Sunday will be a pause in the overall spring warmth and a return
of rain to the forecast. The upper level ridge finally kicks
east as an upstream upper low and associated trough move
eastward. At the surface, a weak cold front approaches from the NW
during the day. This pattern change will bring a chance for light
rain across the North Bay early Sunday before spreading southward
to the South Bay/Santa Cruz Mts Sunday afternoon. Advertised
rainfall amounts from previous forecast remain on track with
generally a few hundredth to one quarter inch in the North Bay.
Rain chances do lingering into Sunday night as the cold front
weakens/washes out on its way to the Central Coast. For what it`s
worth this is not an AR and even though there is rain in the
forecast Sunday it will not be a washout. Additionally, South Bay
southward will actually have a rather pleasant Sunday with a few
clouds, but still mild temperatures. In other words, cooler with
some rain northern areas and some clouds, but still nice weather
southern areas.

To start the work week a brief dip in temperatures with a post
frontal airmass, especially Bay Area northward.

A marked warming trend begins on Tuesday and continues through
Friday as high pressure builds back over the region. While the
maxima of the ridge peaks midweek and is centered over the Desert
SW/Intermountain West above normal 500mb heights and 850mb
temperatures will nose into CA. WPC clusters and ensemble
guidance has rather decent agreement on this longwave pattern
development. In fact, it`s been advertising this solution for
several days now. How about impacts? The ECMWF Extreme Forecast
Index does highlight portions of the Central Coast above normal,
but not extreme. Wednesday and Thursday will be warmest days of
the next seven with interior locations well into the 70s to low
80s with interior Central Coast possibly flirting with 90. Record
territory? Not really as records for this time of year are roughly
15-25 degrees above current forecast. Warmest of 2025? Nope,
we`ve had warmer the last week of February. All that being said,
HeatRisk values to reach the Minor category so if you`re
extremely sensitive to heat take some precautions.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 416 AM PDT Sat Apr 5 2025

VFR except for KHAF as mid-high level clouds stream over the
region. KHAF will deal with occasional cigs AOB 1k ft through the
period. Onshore flow ramps up again this afternoon, but not
overly strong. The last six hours of the TAF for SFO/OAK will be
lower confidence as guidance hints at some low level cigs. For now
will advertise as SCT010.

Vicinity of SFO...VFR through the period.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...VFR.

.MARINE...
(Today through Thursday)
Issued at 416 AM PDT Sat Apr 5 2025

Northerly flow will persist over coastal waters Saturday. A weak
coastal jet will bring locally stronger winds Saturday afternoon
along Santa Cruz and Big Sur coasts. A weak cold front is on track
to move through the waters on Sunday with winds shifting more
southwesterly and light rain possible across the northern waters.
Wave heights build to between 10 to 12 feet Sunday into Monday as
long period moderate swell returns. This will result in increased
shoaling near the coast, bays, and harbor entrances.

&&

.BEACHES...
Issued at 418 AM PDT Sat Apr 4 2025

A Beach Hazard Statement remains in effect for the entire
coastline. A long period swell is forecast to reach the coast
early Sunday morning. Forerunners of 18-20 sec arrive close to
sunrise. Swell periods are forecast to diminish through the day
Sunday and into Monday, but swell heights will gradually increase.
Therefore, initially sneaker waves will be the main threat before
switching to larger shore break and rip currents. Beachgoers
should be mindful Sunday and Monday given potential hazards.
Beachgoers should stay off of jetties and rocks, keep pets on a
leash, wear a life jacket, and never turn your back on the ocean!
