.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 1215 AM PST Wed Nov 29 2023

A closed upper low was evident via moisture channel imagery early
this morning just off the Mendocino Coast with an occluded front
located west of the Bay Area in association with the attendant
surface low. A leading band of showers was progressing inland across
the Bay Area as of this writing with additional scattered showers
located offshore. The upper low is forecast to devolve to an open-
wave trough while sinking southeast towards the Central Coast with
the associated surface front remaining just offshore. Scattered
showers will gradually taper off from northwest to southeast from
late morning into early afternoon as forcing for ascent gradually
wanes. Given cold temperatures aloft and steepening lapse rates
still can`t rule out an isolated thunderstorm or two primarily over
the Pacific waters as modest instability builds. That said scattered
light showers will be the primary weather most folks should
experience today. Total rain amounts still look to average 0.5" or
so within the coastal ranges with most lower elevations seeing 0.25"
or less. Typically rain shadowed/drier locations like the Santa
Clara and Salinas Valleys are likely to see 0.15" or less through
this evening. Temperatures this afternoon should be seasonal with
highs mostly in the lower 60s. Partial clearing this evening should
allow for overnight lows to dip into the 40s for most areas, with a
few of the typically colder inland spots dropping into the upper
30s.

.LONG TERM...
(Thursday through Tuesday)
Issued at 1215 AM PST Wed Nov 29 2023

The region will remain in an unsettled northwest flow pattern aloft
as a series of weak perturbations traverse the mean flow. In general
the best moisture and forcing for ascent will remain across far
NorCal and the Pacific Northwest, however we`ll remain just close
enough to occasionally be brushed with some light showers. Rain
amounts don`t appear overly impressive (generally 0.10" or less)
although it`s possible the Sonoma Coastal Ranges could receive up to
0.25" through early next week. A period of breezy onshore winds is
expected late Thursday into Friday as upper troughing swings through
the Great Basin and surface high pressure strengthens over the
northeast Pacific. Expect a gradual warming trend in temperatures
through early next week as the greatest rain chances shift north of
all but far northern portions of the Bay Area.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 404 AM PST Wed Nov 29 2023

Rain showers continue to push through the region at this hour with
many terminals reporting reduced visibilities as a result of
rain. Expect rain showers to continue to impact terminals through
at least the the mid to late morning today. Although visibilities
are slightly reduced at terminals, conditions largely remain VFR,
with the exception of KSFO and KSTS who have oscillated between
IFR and MVFR. Beyond the late morning, expect widespread VFR
across the region and to persist through the end of the TAF
period. Winds largely remain 10 knots and below once again today,
though shift to become more onshore out of the NW into the
afternoon. Into the evening hours of Wednesday, light and variable
winds prevail, with KSTS beginning to just barely reach LLWS
criteria near 12Z Thursday.


Vicinity of SFO...Currently IFR as a result of reduced visibilities
from rain. Conditions expected to improve to VFR come the late
morning hours as rain showers move out of the region. VFR then
prevails the remainder of the TAF period. Winds light to moderate
today and through the early evening and offshore. Onshore winds
return into the mid evening hours Wednesday, strengthening to become
breezy overnight.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...VFR through the TAF period, with mid level
clouds present. Rain impacts at terminals fade into the late
morning. Current offshore SE winds turn to become more onshore into
the afternoon and light for KMRY. KSNS remains breezy to gusty out
of the SE through the early afternoon thereafter weakening to become
light and variable.

&&

.MARINE...
(Today through Monday)
Issued at 404 AM PST Wed Nov 29 2023

Scattered rain showers are currently impacting the coastal waters,
and are expected to last through the late morning. Isolated
thunderstorms remain possible through the morning hours which
could bring locally gusty conditions and higher seas. Current
fresh SE/E winds gradually diminish and shift to become northerly
late Wednesday into Thursday before strong breezes develop
Thursday morning, with gales possible over the far southern
coastal waters. A larger moderate period northwest swell arrives
in the late week. Weather conditions will remain unsettled into
the weekend.
