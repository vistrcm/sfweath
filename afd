.SHORT TERM...
Issued at 249 AM PDT Wed Aug 27 2025
(Today and tonight)

Mostly clear skies across our area has unexpectedly continued
into the overnight hours, despite a robust marine layer above
2000ft. HiRes and synoptic scale guidance has struggled with the
weak forcing offered by the weak upper level low meandering off
the coast of SoCal. A combination of easing northwest surface flow
over our coastal waters (which led to a small but consequential
increase in water temperature, making cooling to condensation
temperature more difficult) and gravity waves pushing west from
the storms at the foot of the Sierra`s has interrupted the
normally reliable stratus formation. As of this writing (3AM PDT)
some stratus is making a run back toward the shoreline from Point
Reyes down to the Bay Area.

The lack of organized northwest surface winds offshore may lessen
the extent of stratus recovery later tonight into Thursday
morning, but another clear overnight is not expected. With the
exit of monsoonal moisture to our east, a drier airmass (counter
intuitive at first thought) will allow for more radiative cooling
after sunset, helping a return to equilibrium for stratus
development as you get closer to the coastline.

.LONG TERM...
Issued at 249 AM PDT Wed Aug 27 2025
(Thursday through Tuesday)

The extended forecast remains quiet. A window of shortwave ridging
at our latitude between EPAC troughs will result in a brief warm up
for the beginning of the weekend before cooling off slightly into
the beginning of next week. Nonetheless, temperatures will continue
to hover +/- 5F of normal for most locations through at least the
middle of next week. The drier airmass in the wake of the monsoonal
moisture pushing east will result in slightly cooler overnights than
we`ve seen the past few nights and lower minRH values each
afternoon.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 409 AM PDT Wed Aug 27 2025

Coastal stratus /MVFR-IFR-LIFR/ is redeveloping while inland it`s
still mainly VFR. Stratus will mix out by late morning otherwise
VFR continues inland. HREF shows coastal stratus returning tonight
and Thursday morning.

Vicinity of SFO...VFR tempo IFR BKN stratus ceiling 12z-15z this
morning, otherwise VFR today into the evening. IFR stratus ceiling
forecast to return 09z Thursday morning. Mainly west wind 5 to 10
knots except becoming 15 to 25 knots this afternoon and early
evening.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...Stratus /IFR-LIFR/ is more recently
developing, additional stratus will develop through morning.
Stratus then mixes out by late morning and returns this evening
into Thursday morning. Mainly onshore winds 5 to 15 knots.

.MARINE...
(Today through Monday)
Issued at 249 AM PDT Wed Aug 27 2025

Light to moderate breezes and moderate seas will continue across
the coastal waters through late week. Winds will increase to fresh
to strong and seas will build over the weekend.
