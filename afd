...New UPDATE, MARINE...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 138 PM PDT Wed Mar 13 2024

The gradient between strong high pressure to the North and East and
a low pressure trough over coastal California is supporting strong
offshore winds through Friday morning. Otherwise clear skies and a
noticeable warming trend dominates the forecast.

&&

.UPDATE...
Issued at 907 AM PDT Thu Mar 14 2024

Forecast on track for the Wind Advisories through tonight and Friday
morning. Current notable wind gusts this morning are 68 mph at Mt
Diablo and 71 mph at Mt St Helena. Otherwise gusts currently in the
40-50 mph range across much of the North Bay Mtns, Santa Cruz Mtns,
and East Bay hills. Expecting winds to mix down into the valleys
this afternoon with a bit of a relative lull this evening before
another peak period through Friday morning in the North Bay.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 116 AM PDT Thu Mar 14 2024

The large-scale pattern features an omega blocking pattern with high
pressure aloft located over the northeast Pacific and low pressure
over the Four Corners region. The associated surface pressure
pattern consists of high pressure over the northeast Pacific and
Intermountain West with a low pressure trough across coastal
California. This was resulting in a modest offshore pressure
gradient early this morning and strong winds within the Bay Area
hills. Gusts so far have been in the 40-60 mph range for the peaks
above 3,000 feet and these speeds should increase today as the
pressure gradient strengthens. Wind Advisories remain in effect for
much of the higher terrain of the Bay Area and within the North and
East Bay Valleys through tonight and Friday morning. Given high
pressure in control and drier downsloping winds look for highs today
mostly in the mid to upper 60s. Low tonight will be mostly in the
40s to lower 50s.

.LONG TERM...
(Friday through Wednesday)
Issued at 116 AM PDT Thu Mar 14 2024

Friday:

The offshore wind event will continue into Friday morning with Wind
Advisories continuing within the higher terrain of the Bay Area.
While not formally in the advisory area, the remainder of the Bay
Area will also be breezy, with gusts in the 25-35 mph range. Secure
loose outdoor items and be extra cautions for falling trees or
branches given recently saturated soil and potentially storm-
weakened trees. Temperatures will be on the upswing given high
pressure and warm downsloping winds. Look for highs to reach the 70s
inland with upper 60s along the immediate coast and bays. Lows will
be in the 40s with cities around SF Bay holding near 50.

Saturday through Wednesday:

The blocking pattern will remain largely in place as the upper level
high slowly shifts from the northeast Pacific towards the
Intermountain West by early next week. As the surface pressure
gradient weakens winds will relax for the remainder of the extended
period with rather pleasant and seasonally warm conditions
prevailing. Look for highs generally in the 70s with some upper 60s
along the immediate coast. Lows should be in the 40s to around 50.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 425 AM PDT Thu Mar 14 2024

VFR through the period. The main story for the 12z package is
that N/NNE winds will be gusty through much of the day today into
tomorrow morning, but there will be two periods where winds are
expected to ramp up. First period of stronger winds, where
widespread gusts of 30 knots can be expected, has been pushed back
slightly and is now expected to occur around 16z-17z this
morning, persisting into the early afternoon. N/NNE winds remain
breezy during the afternoon but will be reduced with gusts of
20-25 knots. Stronger winds redevelop overnight into Friday
morning as offshore SFO-WMC gradient reaches its peak, so more
widespread gusts of 30-35 knots are possible then.

Vicinity of SFO...VFR. Northerly winds are currently breezy but
expected to strengthen and shift more northeasterly after 17z.
Winds temporarily reduce after 00z this evening before ramping
back up overnight tonight. Winds expected to diminish just beyond
the TAF period by mid morning Friday.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...Light easterly winds and VFR conditions.
E/NE winds will increase later through the morning. Moderate
confidence on wind direction at KMRY and KSNS with some model
disagreement on easterly vs northeasterly later this morning, and
whether or not the sea breeze will gain more influence later this
afternoon, which would result in a more NW wind direction.
However, wind gusts don`t look to be too problematic with low
level jet staying north of the Central Coast. However, could see
gusts up to 15-20 knots briefly mid-morning.

.MARINE...
(Today through Tuesday)
Issued at 907 AM PDT Thu Mar 14 2024

Moderate to strong northerly winds to persist through the morning
before diminishing into the afternoon and evening. Occasional gale
force gusts will be possible across the southern outer waters and
portions of the Suisun Bay and Delta Regions through the early
afternoon. Locally gusty offshore winds will return overnight
lingering through Friday morning. Expect breezy conditions across
the San Francisco Bay and in the nearby coastal waters are
expected  with this second round of wind. Winds and seas will
diminish into  the weekend as high pressure builds.
