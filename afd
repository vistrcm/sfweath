...New UPDATE, MARINE...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 1231 AM PDT Fri May 24 2024

Cool temperatures this weekend with a slight warm up slated for
next week. Quiet, summer-like pattern persists through the period.

&&

.UPDATE...
Issued at 911 AM PDT Fri May 24 2024

Marine layer is sitting around 2k feet this morning as noted by
KOAK sounding. Vis satellite imagery shows the marine layer is
non-continuous across the region with clear skies in locales and
cloudy in other. Why the mix? It`s likely due to strong northerly
flow over the coastal waters battling stronger onshore flow.
Regardless, the trend over the last hour has been thinning of the
cloud deck. Some patchy low clouds will linger along portions of
the coast this afternoon. Speaking of onshore flow, latest obs
show some decent wind gusts through the inland passes/gaps. Gusts
of 35-45 mph have been observed in the East Bay.

No update needed this morning. Simply put, temperatures today
will be below seasonal averages heading into the holiday weekend.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 1231 AM PDT Fri May 24 2024

High clouds passing through the region this morning and through
today in response to a transient upper level trough. Inland
temperatures drop about 4-8 degrees compared to yesterday`s highs
as cooler air makes its way in behind a weak front. Coastal areas
may see a degree or too cooler, but largely unchanged temperature
wise. Main changes to the forecast this morning are the addition
of drizzle to some coastal areas for this morning as the trough
coming through will provide some weak lift within the marine
layer, perhaps even enough for a few hundredths in a few places.
Many locations will see clearing skies today, especially inland,
though many coastal locations may not escape the cloud cover for
most of today thanks to a deep, moist marine layer.

.LONG TERM...
(Saturday through Thursday)
Issued at 1231 AM PDT Fri May 24 2024

Cooler temperatures persist through the weekend as the trough
slowly exits with additional and perhaps more widespread drizzle
into Saturday morning. As a broad ridge builds next week, expect
high temps to gradually increase early week with afternoon highs
right around seasonal normals by the middle of the week. Overall
not much impact in the forecast period. Even with the weak trough
passing inland, winds remain onshore supporting good moisture
return. A typical, quiet, summer-time pattern.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 430 AM PDT Fri May 24 2024

Upper troughing and a deep marine layer has led to MVFR stratus
across most coastal areas of the Bay Area and Central Coast this
morning. Clouds should gradually clear towards the coast by late
morning/early afternoon, but may linger longer around Monterey
Bay. Breezy to gusty onshore winds this afternoon, with MVFR
stratus moving back inland during the early evening hours and
persisting into Saturday AM.

Vicinity of SFO...MVFR stratus should linger through late morning
before scattering. Gusty onshore winds up to 30 kt this afternoon,
with winds remaining gusty through early to mid evening. MVFR
stratus redevelops before midnight tonight and lingers into
Saturday AM.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...MVFR stratus should linger through at
least late morning. Somewhat lower confidence in when clouds will
scatter out especially along the coast at KMRY. Most likely time
is late morning, but a lower confidence (although plausible)
alternate scenario would keep ceilings in place through the
afternoon. Watch for later TAF updates as confidence in today`s
forecast scenario increases. Breezy onshore winds this afternoon
into early this evening. Periods of drizzle possible this morning
and again on Saturday morning.

&&

.MARINE...
(Today through Wednesday)
Issued at 911 AM PDT Fri May 24 2024

A weakening pressure gradient will allow for strong northwesterly
breezes to ever so slightly diminish and significant wave heights
to abate going into the weekend; however, hazardous conditions and
steeper wind waves will still be prevalent across the waters. As
surface high pressure over the Eastern Pacific Ocean builds and
moves east by mid-week, northwesterly breezes will increase and
significant wave heights will build.
