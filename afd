.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 111 PM PST Sat Nov 25 2023

Dry and seasonably cool throughout the weekend. Chances for rain
return by the middle part of this week.

&&

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 337 AM PST Sun Nov 26 2023

Average temperatures Saturday were near or slightly cooler than
late Nov normals, expect similar average temperatures again today.
Morning lows today in a few spots will be close to record lows
for this time of year. On Saturday for example, the Santa Rosa
NWS cooperative station low was 29F, not far from the record low
27F in 1952. The coldest temperatures will occur in low lying
spots where surface air movement is mainly undisturbed and well
beneath or removed from a thermal belt where light vertical mixing
winds and molecular contact would otherwise speed up heat transfer
resulting in a new equilibrium temperature.

Thin cirrus clouds are mainly moving across the southern two
thirds of the forecast area otherwise the sky is clear. A large
variety in temperatures are observed again this morning similar to
24 hours ago, it`s chilly to cold in the valleys and low lying
areas away from a modifying maritime influence and relatively
milder in the hills and mountains where a weak thermal belt
(temperature inversion) is present. Light offshore pressure
gradients and winds are still present resulting in dry air, like
a desert supportive of a large range in temperatures from early
morning (maximum cooling) to afternoon (maximum heating).

A Freeze Warning for the southern Salinas Valley and interior
Monterey and San Benito Counties remains in effect to 9 am today.
A Frost Advisory for the North Bay valleys remains in effect to 9
am today. With little or no change in the weather tonight, decided
to issue another Freeze Warning and Frost Advisory both from 10 pm
tonight to 9 am Monday for the same areas respectively. Nudged lower
by a few degrees the forecast low temperatures for this morning
and Monday morning in the Freeze/Frost areas. Recent statistical
guidance has hinted at patchy freezing fog in the North Bay valleys
this morning, will also be watching for this potential development
mixing in as well though areal coverage should be limited since
conditions (calm winds) are more conducive to frost.

.LONG TERM...
(Monday through Saturday)
Issued at 337 AM PST Sun Nov 26 2023

Statistical guidance for our forecast area Monday night and
Tuesday morning is similar to tonight`s and Monday morning`s;
later shifts may need to reissue Freeze/Frost headlines. Otherwise
milder overnight low temperatures are forecast to return Tuesday
night into Wednesday. There`s model agreement showing an eastern
Pacific low pressure system will bring a wetting rain (> 0.10") to
much of our forecast area mid week; light rain is forecast to arrive
Tuesday night and Wednesday morning, rain then ending Wednesday.

Thursday onward through the weekend model solution divergence
begins, at least somewhat reducing forecast confidence in timing
additional wet weather arriving later in the week and weekend.
We`re less than a month from the first day of astronomical winter
(arrives December 21st 7:27 pm PST), timing is such that with a
strong latitudinal temperature gradient (increasing efficiency,
potential to do work) we should be seeing the hemispheric pattern
undergoing at least some expansion showing a slight increase in
the number of long wave troughs. The CPC 6-10/8-14 day precipitation
outlooks are leaning above normal for much if not all of our
forecast area.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 347 AM PST Sun Nov 26 2023

VFR through the TAF period. Winds stay mostly light with some
moderate easterly winds occuring in the morning and in some areas in
the mid evening. Monterey Bay terminals will see more persistent
southeast winds. Expect only high clouds.


Vicinity of SFO...VFR through the TAF period. Winds stay become
moderate and easterly into through the morning, but return to light
and variable through the rest of the TAF period.


SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO

Monterey Bay Terminals...VFR through the TAF period. Southeasterly
winds last through the mid morning for MRY and into the afternoon
for SNS before becoming light and variable. Expect moderate
southeasterly winds to return late tonight.

&&

.MARINE...
(Tonight through next Thursday)
Issued at 241 AM PST Sun Nov 26 2023

Expect hazardous seas of 9 to 12 feet to continue across waters,
but wave heights will begin to decrease Sunday into the upcoming
week as long period northwest swell of 17 to 19 seconds starts to
diminish. Winds will continue to be relatively light to moderate
over the waters for the first half of the work week. Stronger
winds develop in the mid week and last through the next weekend.

&&

.BEACHES...
Issued at 9:00 PM PST Sat Nov 25 2023

Buoy obs as of 9 PM continue to support longer period (17-20
secs) waves still impacting the coastal waters. The long period
will make the surf zone energetic leading to an increased risk of
sneaker waves especially for northwest- facing beaches. No change
with ongoing Beach Hazards Statement for the coastline from
Sonoma County down to Monterey County through 8 AM Sunday. Sneaker
wave risk diminishes by Sunday afternoon as swell period
decreases, but the waters may still be turbulent with larger
breaking waves, so caution is still advised. In addition to the
increased sneaker wave risk, high astronomical tides are expected
this weekend, which may bring runup farther along the beach.
Beachgoers and tide poolers should use caution and watch out for
unexpected waves that can sweep you off your feet.

A coastal flood advisory was issued earlier this evening to
account for minor coastal flooding inside SF Bay (SF Bay and North
Bay Shorelines)
