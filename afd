.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 346 AM PDT Sun Sep 24 2023

Cool weather continues with fair onshore flow. A potent low
pressure system off the Pacific Northwest brings breezier and
shifting winds as well as a band of rain across the North Bay
early next week. The band of rain will dissipate while moving
southeastward across the remainder of the Bay Area later Monday
and Monday night. Dry weather is forecast for the remainder of the
week, with the potential for warming and drying conditions next
weekend.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 346 AM PDT Sun Sep 24 2023

High clouds are approaching from the Northwest ahead of the the
first rain system the CWA has seen in months. The day will continue

Cloud cover will allow for slightly cooler conditions today and
winds will be slightly breezier overland, but otherwise today will
be fairly similar to the previous few days.

The mostly overcast skies this evening will slow initial cooling,
but widespread lows in the 50s are expected tonight.

models show it slowing as the front begins to cross into Sonoma Co,
causing a slightly later start time for most of the North Bay rain
chances. This chances still commence early Monday and spread as far
south as the Santa Cruz Mountains later in the day. Some adjustments
have been made to precip amounts expected from Early monday through
early Tuesday, but the overall trend that has been forecasted for
the last few days remains:

Rainfall adding up to 0.25-0.5" for far northern Napa/Sonoma
counties, 0.1-0.25" for the rest of the North Bay, and
