...New AVIATION...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 145 AM PST Fri Jan 19 2024

Rain returns to the region today and persists at times into Monday
morning. The two most significant periods for rainfall will be
this afternoon into tonight and Sunday night into Monday morning.
Rain amounts could result in minor flooding of creeks and
roadways. Shallow landslides are also possible given increasingly
saturated soils heading into early next week.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 145 AM PST Fri Jan 19 2024

A negatively tilted upper trough offshore will lift into NorCal and
southern Oregon by this evening. An attendant surface low should
follow a similar path, with an occluding surface front reaching the
coast by tonight. Weak warm advection is already ongoing aloft and
will strengthen into this afternoon ahead of the front. Light
showers will gradually increase in coverage within the warm
advection regime this morning with the bulk of the precipitation
holding off until the mid afternoon to evening hours as warm
advection peaks within the lower levels. Once the initial push of
steadier rain moves through the high resolution models suggest
scattered showers will likely persist during the overnight hours due
to continued instability as temperatures aloft cool. 850 mb winds
are favorably aligned from the S-SW to boost rain totals within the
coastal ranges above those of the lower elevations, with
precipitation likely to begin earlier and last longer than in
surrounding locations. Total rain amounts through tonight will range
from around 1-2" in the coastal ranges, to around 0.5-0.75" for the
North Bay and SF Peninsula, to around 0.25-0.5" for South Bay,
southern Monterey Bay, and interior Central Coast. Sufficient
instability exists for an isolated thunderstorm or two and given
several flashes noted offshore via lightning detection networks
can`t totally rule out a flash or two later as the upper low
approaches. Southerly winds will become increasingly breezy this
afternoon and evening especially along the coast, within the higher
terrain, and through the coastal gaps and passes. Gusts could reach
30-45 mph, with locally higher values possible on the ridgetops.
Temperatures will remain seasonably mild with highs ranging from the
upper 50s in the North Bay to the lower 60s elsewhere in the lower
elevations. Overnight lows will also be mild and generally be within
a few degrees of 50.

.LONG TERM...
(Saturday through Thursday)
Issued at 231 AM PST Fri Jan 19 2024

Buckle up, we`ve got a lot to talk about in the longer
term! Winds will be gusty out of the south early Saturday morning
with gusts generally in the 25-30mph range beyond the frontal
passage. Into the afternoon, winds ease as conditions become
slightly drier. Saturday late afternoon into Sunday afternoon
appears to be the "driest" part of the weekend, though take that
with a grain of salt, as scattered showers will remain between
Friday night`s storm, and the incoming on Sunday.

Looking further into the weekend, Sunday night into early Monday
morning will be the main "money maker" of the multiple rounds of
rain over the weekend, with amounts of 2-3.5" possible in the
coastal mountains. The highest elevations and peaks may potentially
see up to 4.5". Lower elevations such as the SF, North, and Monterey
Bays are likely to see amounts  ranging from 1.5-2". Elsewhere
further inland and in rain-shadowed regions such as the Salinas
Valley and San Jose area, rain amounts are less with precip amounts
up to 1.25" generally.

Associated with this system will be moderate instability,
primarily over the ocean. At this time, model soundings and lapse
rates only suggest moderate instability in the midlevels with
lapse rates around 6.2 - 6.7 C/km, and veering winds with height
suggesting warm air advection. Top this off with upper level
divergence, and you`ve got some ingredients for convection. But
what does this all mean to the layman? The potential for
thunderstorms early Monday morning! That being said, the best
chances exist over the ocean, with only slight chances extending
inland. Remember that when thunder roars, to head indoors! Or, if
you see a flash, dash inside.

Gusty winds out of the south are expected as well, with gusts from
25-30mph generally for higher elevations. In lower elevations, gusts
from 20-25mph are most likely. At this time, no wind advisory has
been issued. Though, as always with increased winds, consider
securing any loose outdoor furniture or things that can easily be
blown over.

So how about the timing of all this? Well, the period of heaviest
and most impactful rain appears to be towards sunrise and the
morning commute of Monday. Gusty winds increase in the early morning
of Monday prior to sunrise, but appear to ease into the late
morning. Come the late evening of Monday, showers begin to diminish,
becoming more scattered. This all being said, be prepared to slow
down, use your windshield wipers (now might be a good time to check
them before the rain!), turn on your headlights, and give extra
distance between yourself and other drivers. Nuisance flooding of
roadways is a possibility, so be sure to avoid driving through
flooded roadways.

Looking beyond this system and further out into the next workweek, a
new low pressure system approaches Tuesday. Light and beneficial
rain is expected with this system, beginning Tuesday and ending
Wednesday morning. Amounts are generally expected to be under 1" for
most areas. For more precise timing and amounts, stay tuned for
updates.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 405 AM PST Fri Jan 19 2024

Initially VFR with the exception of LVK. An approaching cold front
will cause flight conditions to gradually deteriorate to MVFR this
afternoon and MVFR to IFR overnight. Light rain reaches the
terminals by mid to late afternoon, with the heavier/steading rain
rates between about 00Z Friday and 06Z Saturday with decreasing
coverage and intensity thereafter. Low ceilings will linger into
Saturday with winds being southeast and breezy.

Vicinity of SFO...Currently VFR under high clouds with light
winds. The ceiling will gradually lower into the afternoon before
light rain begins to fall and impact visibility. While there may
be a stray shower or two in the morning, the best estimate for the
main band of rain is around 23Z and should persist through the
night into Saturday morning. Rain rates should generally remain
light, with only periodic SHRA expected. However MVFR conditions
should dominate for the remainder of the TAF period.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...Currently VFR with high clouds and light
winds. VFR should persist into this afternoon with gusty SE winds
developing at KSNS. Light rain arrives this afternoon with sub-
VFR conditions developing into this evening. MVFR likely persists
into Saturday.

.MARINE...
(Today through Wednesday)
Issued at 137 AM PST Fri Jan 19 2024

Breezy and gusty southerly winds build today, causing dangerous
conditions for small craft. Rain chances begin over the waters in
the mid morning and last through the weekend as multiple rain
systems move through the region. Thunderstorms are possible over
the waters as well, where wind gusts and seas could be locally
higher near storms. Winds ease into the mid week with some
additional rain expected.

&&

.HYDROLOGY...
Issued at 145 AM PST Fri Jan 19 2024

Due to the potential for significant rainfall over the weekend,
the Weather Prediction Center continues advertising a marginal
risk for excessive rainfall for much of the area, with a slight
risk for the coastal Bay Area and North Bay. A slight risk means
that there is a 15% chance that rain totals could exceed flash
flood guidance issued by the River Forecast Center in Sacramento.
A Hydrologic Outlook has been issued to highlight the potential
for rapid rises along rivers, streams, and creeks. The main
hydrologic issues will be nuisance and minor flooding across the
region, and an increased risk for shallow landslides as soils
across the Bay Area reach saturation. Stay tuned to forecast
updates from a trusted source for the latest information.
