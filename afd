...New UPDATE, MARINE...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 255 AM PST Thu Feb 22 2024

Dry conditions anticipated the remainder of the week and into the
start of the upcoming weekend. Unsettled conditions return by
Sunday morning and potentially into next week, yet no major
impacts are expected.

&&

.UPDATE...
Issued at 839 AM PST Thu Feb 22 2024

Areas of dense fog continue over portions of the North Bay
including Petaluma, Navato and Napa. Thus, a Dense Fog Advisory
remains in effect until 10 AM PST for the North Bay Valleys.
Otherwise, the forecast remains on track for the remainder of the
day.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 413 AM PST Thu Feb 22 2024

We`re monitoring surface observations and satellite imagery for
fog and dense fog development mainly in the North Bay valleys,
elsewhere patchy low clouds are developing and there`s an area of
cirrus clouds with another weak 500 mb short wave trough moving in
from the west. On the fence for now with issuing a dense fog
advisory for the North Bay valleys, will wait a little longer
since the short wave trough may help limit dense fog development.

Dry weather today, daytime temperatures climbing back up to the
lower to mid 60s, not much different from Wednesday`s daytime high
temperatures, maybe a couple degrees warmer inland locations. By
afternoon and evening a 500 mb short wave ridge will have moved in
based on recent NAM forecast. Clear tonight, surface winds becoming
light easterly with high humidity under nocturnal cooling and either
patchy fog or low clouds from the Sacramento Valley possibly
reaching the East Bay.

&&

.LONG TERM...
(Friday through Wednesday)
Issued at 413 AM PST Thu Feb 22 2024

On Friday morning the NAM shows another 500 mb short wave trough
approaching the Central Coast and the Bay Area from the southwest,
coupled to weak 700-500 mb layer convective potential. Model
forecasts are dry during this period, however there may be an
increase in clouds Friday morning and weak layer instability may
produce virga or a few isolated showers during the day. The 500 mb
trough arriving Friday may also stir up surface winds, if early
enough Friday this may affect areal morning low cloud coverage.

Storm development within the long wave trough axis nearing 130W
longitude is taking place per IR satellite imagery. On Friday with
the passage of the aforementioned 500 mb short wave trough the
inflection point in the 500 mb flow will place our forecast area
back under the easternmost general large scale cyclonic flow and
the 500 mb ridge will become firmly placed to our east straddling
the CA/NV border. Best chances for showery weather return later in
the weekend and early next week since the low well to our
southwest is forecast to eventually merge with the 500 mb open
wave trough from the Pacific Northwest.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 414 AM PST Thu Feb 22 2024

Dense fog is currently impacting STS and APC. SFO and terminals
south have been excluded from receiving any stratus/fog throughout
the TAF period. There are currently some high clouds moving over the
region which may be helping that case; however, will need to
continually monitor to see if conditions change after skies become
clear and if current stratus/fog begins to spread. Widespread VFR
will prevail by this afternoon.

Vicinity of SFO...Currently VFR and calm. VFR through the TAF
period. Winds will become northwesterly this afternoon before
becoming offshore overnight.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...Currently VFR with breezy drainage flow at
both terminals. VFR through the TAF period. Winds become onshore by
late-morning before returning to drainage flow overnight.

&&

.MARINE...
(Today through Tuesday)
Issued at 839 AM PST Thu Feb 22 2024

Light to moderate winds last through the weekend. A moderate
period northwesterly swell will persist into next week. Light rain
will return to the waters by Sunday morning, but impacts look
mild.

&&

.MTR WATCHES/WARNINGS/ADVISORIES...
CA...Dense Fog Advisory until 10 AM PST this morning for CAZ506.

PZ...Small Craft Advisory from 3 AM to 9 AM PST Friday for Pt Arena
     to Pt Reyes 10-60 NM.
