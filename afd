...New AVIATION...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 443 AM PDT Sat Jul 1 2023

A strong high pressure system remains located over California and
continues to compress the marine layer, resulting in reduced
visibilities along the coast in fog and low clouds. Removed from
the cool marine influence, inland and higher elevations again today
will be in a Moderate Heat Risk as daytime highs reach 10 to 15
degrees above normal. Thus, the Heat Advisory remains in effect
until Sunday night for those areas. Closer to the coast and bay
shorelines, daytime highs will be within a couple of degrees of
normal. A gradual cooling trend starts early next week bringing
temperatures across the entire forecast area to seasonable values.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 447 AM PDT Sat Jul 1 2023

A strong 500 mb high pressure system is centered over the Central
Coast this morning, only slowly wobbling around with plenty of
sinking air, compressional warming noted again on the profiler
data, with temperatures aloft up to a few degrees warmer compared
to this time yesterday morning. This is resulting in overnight
air temperatures in the mid to upper 70s to as warm as mid 80s in
the hills and mountains of the forecast area. With a well structured
marine layer still in place, lower elevations to sea level temperatures
are sharply cooler in comparison with readings commonly lower 60s to
the 50s. A compressed marine layer varying in depth from 300 feet
Bodega Bay to 1000 feet Fort Ord is resulting in reduced
visibilities to 1/2 to 1/4 mile in fog again along the coastline.
Interestingly, it`s a bit counter-intuitive that the marine layer is
deeper near Fort Ord compared to Bodega Bay, since Fort Ord is
closer to the center of the 500 mb high, yet there is a little
weakness in the thermal field noted in the high at the 700 mb level
which lines up with the Central Coast and if downward vertical
motion is a little weaker, this may explain the difference. This may
also play a role in a wind shift beginning this afternoon, more on
that in a bit.

The warmest to hottest daytime temperatures again will be well
inland farthest from the bays and coast with readings peaking in
the 90s to 100-107; model guidance has generally trended hotter
inland while much closer to the bays and coast there`s been a
slight downward trend. This is a classic July weather scenario
when winds are mostly light onshore, not much if any downsloping
at all with weaker pressure gradients and winds (compared to fall
season) there are typically very large temperature gradients from
the coast/bays to inland, today (and Sunday) will again be very
much like that. Highs today are expected to stay below today`s
record highs, though there`s a slight probability that Livermore
could get within a couple degrees of today`s 110F record back in
1950.

Good reminders on how to avoid heat-related illnesses:

* Stay hydrated and drink plenty of fluids.
* Wear lightweight, light-colored clothing.
* Reduce time spent outdoors or stay in the shade.
* Never leave people or pets unattended in vehicles.

From the first paragraph in the forecast discussion, regarding
forecast wind shift this afternoon, meso-scale models do show
lower level winds shifting to southwesterly along the coast. This
may bring about an ever so slightly opening in the door to cooler
temperatures, if especially coordinating with an increase in
afternoon onshore breezes; not so much to be realized today, but
something to keep in mind as we go into next week. In the marine
forecast, did bump up the winds across the SF Bay to the Delta for
small craft conditions, a little more steepening of the SFO-SAC
pressure gradient and wind trapped beneath the compressed marine
layer, possibly enhancing onshore winds in the afternoon and
evening.

.LONG TERM...
(Sunday through Friday)
Issued at 447 AM PDT Sat Jul 1 2023

In summary, hot again inland Sunday, temperatures cooler at the
coast and bays. Conditions are still favorable for ongoing marine
layer despite model forecasts showing a slight reduction in
overall coverage (tonight and) Sunday. Surface to lower level
winds build a more developed onshore component, this should help
usher in cooler breezes with each passing day next week, lastly
reaching inland locations so shouldn`t expect too much cooling
well inland quite yet, depends how well established the onshore
winds become and if the 500 mb high continues to weaken then
transitioning to 500 mb troughing.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 507 AM PDT Sat Jul 1 2023

Satellite shows stratus building off the coast but the compressed
marine layer is restricting stratus from building inland for most
areas with the exception of Monterey Bay, where patchy fog and
low clouds are expected to last through the early morning hours.
High confidence that VFR condition will prevail through the TAF
period for all terminals north of Monterey Bay.
North/Northwesterly winds are expected to transition from light to
moderate/breezy in the afternoon with the return of light winds
in the night.

Vicinity of SFO...VFR with high confidence that VFR will prevail
through the TAF period. Northwesterly winds are expected to become
breezy in the afternoon between 16-18 knots. Previous TAFs showed
chance for gust up to 20 knots but had low confidence to include as
models lacked suitable agreement.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...LIFR CIGs and visibility is anticipated to
linger through the morning and will start to see some clearing near
17Z. Winds are expected to increase in the afternoon especially for
KSNS as the Salinas Valley will experiences stronger winds up to 15
knots. MVFR to LIFR conditions is expected to return again tonight
with a return of light northwesterly winds.

&&

.MARINE...
(Today through Thursday)
Issued at 327 AM PDT Sat Jul 1 2023

Surface high pressure located over the eastern Pacific will result
in gusty northwesterly winds primarily over the northern outer
waters, where associated locally steep wind waves will create
hazardous conditions for small craft. Gusty westerly to southwesterly
winds developing this afternoon and evening north of the Bay Bridge
to the Delta. Otherwise, mixed seas continue with a longer period
southerly swell and a moderate period northwesterly swell, through
the middle of next week.

&&

.FIRE WEATHER...
(Today through Tuesday)
Issued at 335 AM PDT Sat Jul 1 2023

Hot and dry conditions inland will increase fire danger and
ignition probabilities as daytime temperatures reach the 90s.
Meanwhile, the marine layer will remain compressed to less than
1000 feet through Sunday resulting in little to no overnight
humidity recovery in the hills. Hot afternoon temperatures will be
followed by mild to warm nights in the higher terrain. Overall,
expect hot temperatures and light winds, especially inland with
light onshore breezes near the coast and in the coastal valleys.
As a result, ERC values will climb sharply this weekend, likely
above the 90th percentile in the hills with muted growth for lower
elevations that will still see better humidity recovery each night.
Despite the cool down early next week, more modest humidity
recoveries lag behind in the far interior and in the higher
terrain. Any nighttime ignitions in the hills this weekend will
not get typical humidity recover to help with suppression.

.BEACHES...
Issued at 103 PM PDT Thu Jun 29 2023

With the upcoming heat event for the weekend before Independence
Day, a lot of people are expected to seek relief at the beaches.
There are two main risks to beachgoers. The first risk is that
water temperatures remain cold in the 50s. Unprepared beachgoers
may suffer cold weather shock if they are not used to being in the
ocean. As a side note, travelers to mountain streams should be
aware that due to continuing snowmelt, the streams are colder than
usual, increasing the risk of cold weather shock. The second risk
for beachgoers is the threat for rip currents. While the rip
current risk is not higher than usual this weekend, it`s still
important for folks to watch out for each other as beaches may be
more crowded than normal.

Never turn your back to the ocean! It is safest to swim at a beach
with lifeguards. If you are caught in a rip current, don`t try to
swim against it. Instead, swim out of the current, parallel to the
shore, and then back to shore. If you can`t swim, float or tread
water, and yell or wave for help if you need assistance.
