.UPDATE...
Issued at 850 AM PST Tue Jan 27 2026

It was a chilly morning across the interior valleys where
temperatures dropped into the mid to upper 30s. Portions of far
interior Monterey County (vicinity of Fort Hunter Liggett) dropped
below freezing overnight. Temperatures are warming up with fog
currently being reported at the Livermore Airport. Light rain
remains on track to return to the North Bay this evening into the
overnight hours. Precipitation totals remain light with between 0.25-
0.50" in the North Bay and up to 0.10" across San Francisco and
portions of the East Bay/San Mateo County. No impacts are expected
from this due to the substantial dry spell in between our last
system and this current one.

.SHORT TERM...
Issued at 319 AM PST Tue Jan 27 2026
(Today and tonight)

The 00z KOAK sounding recorded 0.43" PWAT last night with HiRes
short-term soundings indicating similar or lower values until after
sunrise this morning in the North Bay, with the boundary layer not
beginning to saturate until later this morning into the afternoon
that far north. Prefrontal drizzle or light rain is possible along
the North Bay coastal ranges later this morning into the afternoon
with the added lift. Otherwise, the bulk of the rainfall is expected
to move inland after sunset tonight, and shift east by sunrise
Wednesday morning. Slight chance PoPs extend as far south as the
Santa Cruz mountains later today and tonight, however rain totals
south of the North Bay are expected to be less than 0.1" where it
does rain. Inland areas of the North Bay like Santa Rosa are likely
to see around 0.20" (mean hi-res ensemble %) with higher end
reasonable amounts near 0.30" (hi-res 75th%), thus little impacts
beyond wetting rainfall are expected. Lesser amounts are expected
farther east as the progressive shortwave trough moves out of our
area to the east.

.LONG TERM...
Issued at 319 AM PST Tue Jan 27 2026
(Wednesday through Monday)

The progressive upper level trough moving across the North Bay will
shift east Wednesday morning with a ridging pattern developing
quickly in its wake. Weak offshore flow will return as a result with
another dry airmass filling in for the remainder of the work week
into the beginning of weekend. Long period westerly swell and
increasing wave heights will result in an increased risk of sneaker
waves and riptides along with breaking waves up to 19ft Wednesday
night through Friday morning, with a Beach Hazards statement issued
for that time period, see the Beach Hazards discussion for more
details. Slight chance PoPs return as soon as late Saturday night
into Sunday for the North Bay once again, however a lack in
consensus of the location, depth and timing of the developing trough
leaves far more questions than answers at this point.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 359 AM PST Tue Jan 27 2026

Pockets of fog are affecting the North Bay as will as LVK and HAF,
while the rest of the TAF sites remain VFR. High clouds continue to
build into the region through much of the the day as the next front
nears with mid-level clouds arriving into the afternoon. Expect
light rain and MVFR clouds along the front as it passes through the
area tonight. The front will also offer moderate southerly winds
with weaker, shifting winds behind it. Cloud cover will be slow to
erode in the post-frontal environment into Wednesday morning, with
trapped moisture in the North Bay causing IFR CIGs.

Vicinity of SFO...VFR lasts into the night. Expect mostly light and
variable winds through the late morning before turning southwest for
the afternoon and the evening. MVFR CIGs and light rain arrives with
the front into the night, while winds turn southerly. CIGs linger
into the late night as rain chances exit and winds turn westerly.
VFR returns in the mid to late morning on Wednesday as winds turn
northerly and CIGs lift and scatter.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...VFR through the TAF period. Light and
affect MRY through the forecast. Winds stay east to southeast
through the morning and into the mid afternoon, with more moderate
winds possible at SNS. Winds turn southwest at MRY for the
afternoon, while SNS goes northwest. Light rain moves through the
area into the night, but does not look to be impactful. These rains
will be accompanied by mid-level clouds.

&&

.MARINE...
(Today through Sunday)
Issued at 850 AM PST Tue Jan 27 2026

Light to moderate southerly flow will prevail over most of the
waters as a weak cold front approaches from the west today through
early Wednesday morning. This will bring light rain to the
northern coastal waters through Wednesday morning. Winds will be
moderate to breezy north of Point Reyes with locally hazardous
conditions for small craft. Winds diminish on Wednesday and switch
to northerly that night. Moderate seas will prevail through
Tuesday, but build rough to very rough Wednesday night.

&&

.BEACHES...
Issued at 359 AM PST Tue Jan 27 2026

Long period swells with low wave  heights begin to arrive on
Wednesday, but wave heights begin to increase that night while
periods stay long leading to hazardous conditions. A Beach
Hazards Statement has been issued from 09 PM Wednesday through 09
AM Friday. Significant wave heights look to range from 14 to 19
feet. The main threat will be from sneaker waves and rip currents.
Stay off of jetties, piers, rocks, and other waterside
infrastructure. Remain out of the water to avoid hazardous surf
and NEVER turn your back on the ocean.
