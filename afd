...New SYNOPSIS, SHORT TERM, LONG TERM, AVIATION, MARINE...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 235 AM PST Thu Dec 14 2023

After patchy morning fog or frost mainly in the interior valleys,
gradually warmer daytime high temperatures are forecast into the
weekend. Cooler, wet weather returns by the end of the weekend and
next week.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 343 AM PST Thu Dec 14 2023

A push of drier continental air arrived Wednesday morning due to
the larger scale WMC-SFO pressure gradient and offshore winds. For
early this morning so far this has greatly scaled back the areal
coverage of fog compared to early Wednesday morning. Currently cirrus
clouds may be helping to slow radiative cooling a little bit as
well. Will monitor surface observations and satellite and for now
wait on issuing a dense fog advisory unless observations show
surface visibility < 1/4 mile and especially if coverage expands
through daybreak. Will guess at this point that a dense fog advisory
will not be necessary since all parameters are forecast to hold
steady (persistence forecast) even including surface pressures
which are forecast to hold steady or slightly increase through
morning. Patchy frost may develop in the far northern and southern
interior valleys where the wind is calm this morning.

Dry weather continues today with the 500 mb ridge over the Bay Area
this morning. The ridge will steadily move eastward reaching Nevada
by this afternoon. Daytime highs will climb to similar levels on
Wednesday except cooler if where patchy valley fog may hold together
longer during the morning/day, possibly similar to the cooler temps
in the North Bay valleys on Tuesday.

Minor coastal flooding will be a concern again this morning around
the San Francisco/San Pablo Bay as tidal levels are running about
1/2 to 3/4 foot above predictions. High tide for San Francisco is
11:26 AM today.

Patchy fog or frost may redevelop in the far northern and southern
interior valleys late tonight and Friday morning.

.LONG TERM...
(Friday through Wednesday)
Issued at 343 AM PST Thu Dec 14 2023

There remains good nearer term forecast model agreement that a
long wave trough over the eastern Pacific reaches ~ 135W longitude,
becoming a 500 mb cut off low a few hundred miles west of the Bay
Area on Friday. Some forward slowing of the 500 mb low will occur
since the surrounding synoptic pattern is mostly dominated by
high pressure. Surface high pressure will remain over the Great
Basin resulting in a WMC-SFO pressure gradient and offshore
(drying) wind, which will either maintain or steepen a bit more
with surface pressures lowering along our coast out to the surface
low center offshore. What this means is model forecasts for rain
will be up against an initial drying influence of offshore winds,
until late in the weekend when mid level instability i.e. showers
possibly a few thunderstorms within a lower to mid level wind
shift/trough, winds shifting to southwesterly with the trough
passage. 00z/06z NAM output are hinting that the merging polar and
subtropical jet streams stay mainly to our south, including
possibly the majority of convective potential this far north only
reaching the Big Sur Coast. This may be our best chance of wet
weather corresponding to a narrow channel of subtropical air and
instability before it moves eastward away from our forecast area;
obviously will need to closely monitor if it shifts farther
northward to the Bay Area, however the caveat is merging jet
streams don`t often form over our forecast area (a possible model
bias). The 00z ECMWF also doesn`t show much if any surface warm
front reaching our forecast area late in the weekend.

For later Monday and Tuesday the cold air aloft with the parent
500 mb cut off low will steadily weaken, but not without bringing
more showery weather to the forecast area. The 700-500 mb layer
instability will have already moved east and south of the forecast
area, any remaining instability likely minimal during this time.

Before 120 hours (5 days out) more troughing from Alaska will break
through to the southeast toward California, however similar to the
previously developed low it`ll become a 500 mb cut off low with low
confidence in its forecast trajectory during the middle to later part
of next week. A closer trajectory to Bay Area & north Central Coast
brings rain, or if farther offshore then passing to our south, less
rain. Stay tuned to further updates.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 327 AM PST Thu Dec 14 2023

Generally VFR with high clouds throughout the TAF period, with the
exception being near STS where fog is expected to persist through
the rest of the night. Low confidence in model outputs that show
some stratus developing early this evening in the Salinas Valley.
Winds remain generally light and offshore, with a coastal breeze
developing in the afternoon.

Vicinity of SFO... VFR through the TAF period, with light offshore
winds.

SFO Bridge Approach... Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals... Low confidence (up to 20% probability) of
low stratus during the early evening hours, otherwise generally VFR
through the TAF period. Valley drainage flow expected through the
morning with light onshore flow this afternoon, turning back
offshore this evening.

&&

.MARINE...
(Tonight through next Monday)
Issued at 233 AM PST Thu Dec 14 2023

Light south-southeasterly winds continue through the day as high
pressure builds once again. Unsettled weather returns this weekend
as a new storm system approaches, bringing widespread rain,
possible thunderstorms in the southern waters, and southerly
winds. Wind speeds will strengthen starting Friday and continue to
strengthen through the weekend. Fresh northwest swell continues
to build through the day. Large southwest swell arrives this
weekend creating waves of 10-13 feet.

.MTR WATCHES/WARNINGS/ADVISORIES...
CA...Coastal Flood Advisory from 11 AM this morning to 2 PM PST this
     afternoon for CAZ006-506-508.

PZ...Small Craft Advisory from 3 PM Friday to 3 AM PST Saturday for
     Pt Arena to Pt Reyes 10-60 NM.
