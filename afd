.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 1204 AM PST Sun Feb 9 2025

An inverted trough along the coast, high pressure in the Eastern
Pacific, and a very dry air mass will persist through the short
term forecast. Frost and freeze products are in effect for most of
the area through 9 AM. Temperatures are dropping quickly
overnight, and many areas are already in the upper 30s. There are
some microscale question marks that may upset the forecast
locally. For example, Half Moon Bay is colder than expected. It
has already dropped to 39F for the first time since October.
Meanwhile, a northerly breeze is keeping Santa Rosa at 42 degrees.
The NBM expects the temperature to drop to 29 at Santa Rosa this
morning, which will not happen if the wind remains for much
longer. Why does wind matter for min temperature? There are 2 ways
to get cold temperatures. Either a cold air mass moves in, or
there is enhanced radiational cooling at night. Our air mass (as
measured by 850 mb and 500 mb temperature) is only around the 25th
percentile for this time of year. Meanwhile, the precipitable
water (integrated moisture) is way down in the 2nd percentile. So
the air mass is colder than normal, but the air is much drier than
normal, allowing radiational cooling to be the main driver
tonight. Radiational cooling is surfaced based. The actual ground
emits energy to space, and the surrounding air gets cold from
conduction with the ground. If there is wind, this conduction is
inhibited. Even if the air starts the night calm and gets cold,
any subsequent wind will cause vertical mixing with the warmer air
aloft. This will cause the temperatures to bounce around tonight.

.LONG TERM...
(Monday through Saturday)
Issued at 1204 AM PST Sun Feb 9 2025

The forecast remains consistent through Tuesday with an inverted
trough along the coast, gentle northerly wind, very dry air, and
cold mornings. High clouds will likely start to make an appearance
as early as Monday. Mariners have known for centuries that these
clouds signal an upcoming change in the weather pattern. By
Wednesday morning, A zonal jet stream will support a fast moving
gale force low roughly 1000 miles west of northern California. An
associated warm front will reach the coast around this time,
bringing the first round of rain. The rain on Wednesday will be
significant, with up to 1" in the lowlands and a marginal (5-15%)
chance of flash flooding. There may be a break on Wednesday before
more significant rain moves in early Thursday. The low will
continue to strengthen and move closer to the coast of northern
California, with the central pressure reaching mid 980s. This is
when the real atmospheric river impacts begin. A cold front will
extend back towards Hawaii, with SW flow ahead of the front
pumping tropical moisture to the region through the day Thursday.
CW3E is now predicting an AR2 for the Bay Area and (new update)
AR3 for the Central Coast. The IVT magnitude is moderate around
500 kg/ms with roughly 48 hour duration. The duration is a little
longer, and max IVT a little higher along the Central Coast, hence
the higher designation. We`re expected multiple inches of rain
from this system, especially in the coastal mountains. Thursday is
going to be a total wash-out. The Weather Prediction Center has
issued a slight (15-40%) risk of flash flooding. We are more
confident in urban and small stream flooding impacts. Finally,
USGS sensors are indicating saturated soils around the Bay Area.
We are near the level (30% water content by volume) where shallow
landslides are expected during high rain rates. The rain will
taper off through the day Friday and the weekend looks dry for
now.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 315 AM PST Sun Feb 9 2025

Currently VFR at all terminals. High confidence in VFR through the
TAF period thanks to an exceptionally dry air mass and
northerly/offshore winds.

Vicinity of SFO...Currently VFR with westerly flow. High confidence
in VFR through the TAF period. Winds will veer to become offshore
later this morning with the sea breeze returning this afternoon.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...Currently VFR with southeasterly flow at
MRY and VFR and calm at SNS. High confidence in VFR through the TAF
period. Onshore flow will return to MRY this afternoon in the form
of the sea breeze, winds will return to southeasterly flow late
tonight. Winds will prevail out of the northwest for SNS.
