...New UPDATE...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 140 AM PDT Mon Sep 2 2024

Relatively quiet weather will persist through the Labor Day weekend.
A noticeable warming and drying trend will kick off tomorrow with a
minor cooldown slated for Friday and into the weekend.

&&

.UPDATE...
Issued at 812 AM PDT Mon Sep 2 2024

A mid/upper level low is pushing inland to our north over northern
California and southern Oregon. This has allowed our marine layer at
around 1,000-1,500 feet in depth to be well mixed out with low
clouds only impacting the San Francisco Bay Area this morning. These
clouds will dissipate by mid morning and give way to mostly clear
conditions region wide. The forecast largely remains on track this
morning with no updates anticipated at this time.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 140 AM PDT Mon Sep 2 2024

The upper-level disturbance that will be responsible for bringing
the area near normal temperatures and onshore winds today is just
offshore the California/Oregon border. The marine layer is currently
being observed at 1,000 feet and is expected to further compress to
500 feet as the upper-level disturbance exits and high pressure
builds in.

Fire safety:

-Use grills/smokers on gravel or paved surfaces.

-Keep water stored near campfires, fire pits, grills, smokers,
burning brush, etc.

-Maintain vehicle brakes and tires, and secure tow chains to avoid
dragging. Don`t drive on dry grass or brush.

Hiking Safety:

-Bring plenty of water.

-Wear lightweight clothing and a hat.

-Don`t forget the sunscreen.

-Let someone know where you are going and your expected time to
return.

Water safety:

-Whenever possible, swim at beaches with lifeguards. The chances of
drowning at a beach with lifeguards are 1 in 18 million.

-Do what experienced surfers and lifeguards do: watch the ocean for
at least 20 minutes. Study its wave patterns. Get a feel for the
pattern of the waves before relaxing on the beach or engaging in
recreational activities.

-Cold water shock can be just as severe and dangerous from water
temperatures of 50-60F as it is from water at 35F. Wearing a life
jacket significantly increases chances of survival.

-Never turn your back on the ocean.

.LONG TERM...
(Tuesday through Sunday)
Issued at 140 AM PDT Mon Sep 2 2024

A warming and drying trend will kickoff Tuesday as high pressure
builds into the region and becomes the dominant weather feature. In
terms of warming, widespread moderate HeatRisk returns with
Wednesday and Thursday forecast to be the days of greatest impact
with maximum temperatures 5-15 degrees above average at areas away
from the coast. In terms of drying, poor relative humidity
recoveries and northerly/offshore winds during the overnight and
morning hours, albeit light, are expected for the higher elevations.

A minor cooling trend will begin Friday and persist through the
weekend as troughing takes shape off the West Coast. In addition,
there is uncertainty in the form of a surface perturbation that may
develop over California/Nevada. There is not a strong signal for
moisture or instability at this time, let alone coinciding at the
same time, but it is something that we will keep both eyes on.
