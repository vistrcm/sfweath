.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 115 AM PDT Sun Aug 11 2024

Notable cooling begins today, with temperatures at or below seasonal
averages through the rest of the week.

&&

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 115 AM PDT Sun Aug 11 2024

Mid- to high-level clouds are streaming over the region, keeping
winds somewhat breezy and disrupting the formation of marine layer
stratus away from the immediate coast. This morning`s lows remain in
the 50s to low 60s in the valleys, and up to the mid 70s in the
thermal belts. A significant cooling trend is set to begin as an
upper level trough forms over the West Coast, with forecast highs
across the inland regions dropping by up to 5 to 10 degrees from
yesterday`s highs, resulting in highs in the mid 70s to the low 90s,
except in the warmest spots in interior Monterey and San Benito
counties where highs could reach values near 100. Along the Pacific
coast, highs will remain in the mid 50s to mid 60s.

Breezy onshore winds will develop this afternoon and evening with
wind gusts up to 25 to 30 miles per hour through the gaps, passes,
and northwest-southeast oriented valleys. Combined with low
humidities above the thermal belts, the last two days have seen some
stations above the marine layer influence reaching red flag
criteria. Overnight humidity recoveries remain poor over the thermal
belt; otherwise fire weather conditions will improve with cooler and
more moist air moving in.

.LONG TERM...
(Monday through Saturday)
Issued at 115 AM PDT Sun Aug 11 2024

Upper level troughs will be the theme of the upcoming week, and by
mid-week, inland highs should bottom out in the mid 70s to upper
80s. The coastal regions remain relatively stable in the mid 50s to
the mid 60s. CPC outlooks continue to show a lean towards
temperatures at or below seasonal averages into the first week of
September.

Model cross-sections are noting a wedge of elevated dry air coming
in on Monday and Tuesday, which could cause elevated fire weather
concerns in elevations above 2000 feet. While onshore winds should
prevent widespread critical fire weather, breezy and gusty winds at
elevation could result in some locations seeing conditions reach red
flag criteria.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 358 AM PDT Sun Aug 11 2024

Coastal stratus is impacting, or will be impacting area terminals
shortly, brining IFR CIGs. Expect late clearing in the 16-18Z
window. Winds W/NW generally and breezy for most terminals. SFO may
see a gust or two reach into the 20-25 knot range. Stratus returns
in the early evening for KMRY, but later for other terminals,
generally bringing IFR CIGs.

Vicinity of SFO...A few amendments have been needed tonight as
stratus has not begun to cover the terminal with low CIGs as
previously expected. High clouds may be limiting radiational
cooling, and therefore the ability for stratus to form. However,
given a clear patch currently over the terminal, thoughts are that
low IFR CIGs will impact the terminal prior to, and through sunrise.
Clearing to VFR near 16Z. Winds onshore and breezy in the afternoon
today.

SFO Bridge Approach...Low clouds will likely be present over the bay
waters through much of the overnight tonight, though as far south as
the bridge approach is expected to remain clear.

Monterey Bay Terminals...Currently IFR, lasting through the late
morning. High clouds will continue to be present through the morning
today. Clearing to VFR late, towards noon today. Winds W/NW but
generally below 10 knots today. FEW low clouds may linger despite
VFR conditions. Stratus returns early in the evening, bringing IFR
CIGs.

.MARINE...
(Today through Friday)
Issued at 358 AM PDT Sun Aug 11 2024

Fresh northwest winds will continue over the coastal waters
through the middle of next week, afterwards increasing to become
strong. Significant wave heights are beginning to abate with wave
heights between 6 to 8 feet expected through the remainder of the
weekend. Moderate northwest swell and light southerly swell
continue to move through the waters over the next few days.
