...New UPDATE...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 154 AM PDT Mon May 19 2025

Elevated fire weather conditions today for far interior portions
of the East Bay, South Bay, and Central Coast. Strong northerly
winds and above normal temperatures continue today with hazardous
marine conditions lingering through Tuesday.

.UPDATE...
Issued at 911 AM PDT Mon May 19 2025

Welcome to another work week. Not a bad way to start, sunny skies
and warmer temperatures. Webcams and satellite imagery both show
clear skies over the region with a few clouds over the outer
coastal waters. One potential spoiler for sensible weather today
will be the winds. If you`ve been thinking, `It sure has been
windy lately,` you`re right-it has been breezy to gusty since
last week. Today will be no different with light to moderate winds
this morning, but at the northerly pressure gradient (SFO-ACV)
tightens this afternoon winds ramp up as well.

No update  for the morning.

Key Messages for the week
-Windy off and on
-Elevated fire weather concerns due to winds
-Warm up through midweek and then a cooldown by next weekend

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 154 AM PDT Mon May 19 2025

High pressure over the Eastern Pacific Ocean and a reinforcing upper-
level trough over the Four Corners will be the driver of our weather
today. High pressure in the Pacific Northwest and low pressure in
the Desert Southwest will continue to support a surface pressure
gradient that is conducive for northerly (drying) flow as
pressure flows from high to low and wind follows suit in the
isobars. Wind and subsequently elevated fire weather conditions
from wind and relative humidity are the focus of the short term
forecast. Wind gusts of 40-50 mph can be expected along the
immediate coastline, over the waters, and in the higher terrain
with 25-35 mph expected elsewhere. Elevated fire weather
conditions are for dry fuels (primarily grasses and other
finer/flashier fuels) alongside low relative humidity and strong
and gusty winds that will help spread a fire if one were to
develop.

&&

.LONG TERM...
(Tuesday through Sunday)
Issued at 154 AM PDT Mon May 19 2025

As the surface pressure gradient relaxes Tuesday, northwesterly
flow will return, resulting in better overnight relative humidity
recovery and cooler conditions. Wednesday will be the warmest day
of the week with temperatures up to 10 degrees above normal away
from the immediate coast. This will translate to widespread minor
HeatRisk away from the immediate coast and moderate HeatRisk in
the East Bay Interior Valleys. Global ensemble clusters dictate
that it is likely that heights will fall Thursday and that an
upper-level ridge is somewhere across the West by Sunday. While
there is some uncertainty in the longwave pattern Thursday through
Saturday, no impactful weather or rainfall is expected through
the long term forecast. Oakland Museum (OAMC1) and San Francisco
Downtown (SFOC1) will put their daily minimum temperature records
in jeopardy this week. Oakland Museum (OAMC1):
Wednesday (5/21), Saturday (5/24), and Sunday (5/25) have previous
records of 49 degrees set in 1986, 2011, and 1980 respectively,
the official forecast is 51, 52, and 51 degrees respectively. San
Francisco Downtown (SFOC1): Friday (5/23) has a previous record
of 47 degrees set in 2010, the official forecast is 50 degrees.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 439 AM PDT Mon May 19 2025

VFR is expected to prevail through the day and evening hours with
MVFR ceilings possible after midnight into the early morning hours
Tuesday toward the end of the forecast period. Westerly north
winds will increase this afternoon and are expected to gradually
ease after sunset.

Vicinity of SFO...West winds have decreased early this
Monday morning but will increase and become gusty once again this
afternoon, with gusts between 25 to 34 knots, possibly higher at
times. Winds are expected to begin to ease once again after sunset
and the passage of a weak surface cold front.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...Low stratus can be seen developing
offshore early this Monday morning with low confidence that it
will spread farther east over the coast line. A tempo group has
been added for the early morning hours after sunrise to account
for the potential of IFR cigs. Otherwise, VFR is expected to
prevail through much of the TAF period this afternoon and evening
with MVFR cigs expected to develop after midnight into the early
morning hours Tuesday, low confidence in exact timing attm.

.MARINE...
(Today through Saturday)
Issued at 439 AM PDT Mon May 19 2025

Widespread strong northerly breezes with gale force gusts are
expected over the inner and outer waters through Tuesday.
Hazardous marine conditions will persist Wednesday through  Friday
with strong northwesterly breezes with near gale force  gusts and
rough to very rough seas.
