.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 1204 AM PST Fri Dec 27 2024

Multiple rain systems will move across northern California through
the weekend, bringing periods of rain to the region. Dangerous
surf and beach conditions are expected into the weekend. Dry
weather should arrive for the early part of next week, which could
lead to some cold morning temperatures.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 1204 AM PST Fri Dec 27 2024

Stratiform rain extends across the Bay Area and edges into the
Central Coast, with the rain expected to taper off later this
morning. This current rainmaker is expected to be the most intense
of the series of systems coming through northern California,
especially for locations south of the North Bay. The higher
elevations could expect up to 1-2 inches of additional rain from
this system, while the lower elevations of the Bay Area are
generally forecast for around 0.5-1" of rain, except in the rain
shadowed Santa Clara Valley, where up to 0.25" is expected. On the
Central Coast, the Monterey-Salinas region sees around 0.25" of rain
while the interior valleys could see a few sprinkles. Gusty winds
also continue through the morning, with gusts as high as 30-40 mph
along the coast, at the ridgetops, and through gaps and passes,
before tapering off later in the morning and afternoon.

Mainly dry conditions are expected for the day, with some lingering
showers possible at the higher elevations, before another round of
rain comes into the North Bay later tonight into Saturday. This rain
system is expected to be lighter, with rainfall totals 0.5-0.75" in
the North Bay mountains and up to 0.25" in the North Bay valleys,
and more concentrated, with a few sprinkles possible in the coastal
and Bayshore SF Bay Area and nothing expected in the interior Bay
Area and south of Santa Cruz.

.LONG TERM...
(Friday night through next Wednesday)
Issued at 136 PM PST Thu Dec 26 2024

Zonal flow through the early portion of the weekend will let
additional disturbances pass over us, keeping our weather wet. An
upper level trough barrels through the PacNW Sunday into early
Monday, which should be the last hurrah for rain for us as ridging
builds behind it. This period of ridging will let colder air nestle
into the region, leading to some chilly mornings for the start of
the work week. Will need to keep an eye out for any sort of frost
advisories for the North Bay Valleys and interior Monterey and San
Benito counties as temperatures look to fall into the 30s. Beyond
that, ensemble and model guidance start to differ around the New
Year / beginning of January. Kept NBM guidance in for now as it
advertises light rain for the North Bay counties and San Francisco
peninsula.

Winds will temporarily shift to the west across the coastal waters
and bays this morning. On Sunday a cold front will arrive from the

.BEACHES...
Issued at 1000 PM PST Thu Dec 26 2024

A High Surf Advisory is now in effect through 4 AM Sunday. Large
NW swell will persist through late Saturday night to early Sunday
morning. Swell will be roughly 15 feet with a 15 second period,
translating to 20-30 foot breaking waves, depending on the beach
orientation and bathymetry (beach slope). The waves will peak Friday
and begin to abate through the day Saturday. While these waves are
smaller than the monster waves we got on Monday, the coast is still
dangerous. Inexperienced swimmers should stay out of the water, wave
watchers should maintain a safe distance, and no one should ever turn
their back on the ocean. Let`s get through this weekend without another
ocean fatality.
