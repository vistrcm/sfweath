...New AVIATION...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 345 AM PDT Thu Aug 24 2023

Southerly winds along the coast with fog and stratus moving
northward, clear, hazy inland. Above normal temps inland again
today. Slight cool down towards normal and less muggy continuing
as we approach the weekend. Breezy northwest coastal winds
restored by the weekend also.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 352 AM PDT Thu Aug 24 2023

It was a challenging high temperature forecast (for Wednesday) from
yesterday`s midnight/early morning shift, hat tip to the day shift
for catching this and the upward adjustments made to the forecast.

Today`s forecast highs will be no less challenging again since
now there is a southerly pressure gradient and coastally trapped
southerly wind reversal along with fog and stratus developing per
satellite imagery and surface observations. A little patchy light
drizzle may accompany the fog and stratus. Meso-scale models are
picking up on the southerly pressure gradient, but are not as
strong as current observations show, thus there`s greater
potential for cooling down along the immediate coast within the
depth of the marine layer. The marine layer is 1,000 to 1,400 feet
deep at Fort Ord and Point Sur respectively, however it`s so far
compressed to near sea level at Bodega Bay. Will closely monitor
progression of fog and stratus through remainder of shift; may
need to make further slightly downward adjustments to coastal
high temps today. Inland warm to hot again today, above normal by
a few degrees for late August, however forecast highs today are
below today`s record highs.

Tonight temperatures continue to cool down, mostly along the coast,
but extending inland too with an intrusion of fog, stratus reaching
farther inland, lows in the 50s/lower 60s.

.LONG TERM...
(Friday through Wednesday)
Issued at 352 AM PDT Thu Aug 24 2023

Continuing a cool down, at least for the weekend and early next
week, limiting heat risks to nearly none at the immediate coast
to minor or moderate inland. Increasing northwesterly winds over
the coastal waters especially over the weekend resulting in cold
water upwelling and cooler seabreezes. There`s good agreement in
the global model output showing the anomalously strong high pressure
system over central CONUS retrograding back toward southern and central
California while a deep long wave trough develops over the east. A
closed 500 mb low remains to our northwest through the weekend, slowly
advancing eastward across the western CONUS by mid next week.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 428 AM PDT Thu Aug 24 2023

A weak southerly surge has brought LIFR ceilings up the coast to
Pigeon Point, throughout much of the Monterey Bay region and heading
down the Salinas Valley. The surge is not expected to come to the SF
Bay Area, where terminals are expected to remain at VFR for the rest
of tonight. Stratus across the Monterey Bay burns off by 17-18Z.
Breezy westerly flow develops this afternoon with speeds of up to 10-
15 knots, diminishing in the evening. this evening should see the
return of stratus coverage inland with greatest confidence in the
Sonoma Valley, the East Bay, and around the Monterey Bay region.

Vicinity of SFO... VFR through the night. West-northwest winds
picking up in the afternoon with gusts up to 15-20 knots,
diminishing in the evening. A low confidence (20-40% probability)
for stratus developing over the terminal this evening. Confidence is
greater to the north of SFO and the East Bay including OAK. If
stratus does form, it clears out late on Friday morning.

SFO Bridge Approach... Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals... SNS socked in with LIFR ceilings, but
rather surprisingly MRY has remained clear even as stratus surrounds
the terminal on all but the southeast side. Expect the stratus to
fill in sometime during the night, with stratus clearing out around
17-18Z. West to northwest winds building this afternoon with speeds
up to 10-15 knots, diminishing in the evening as IFR-LIFR stratus
returns, alongside a low confidence (20-30% probability) for early
morning fog at MRY.

.MARINE...
(Tonight through next Monday)
Issued at 228 AM PDT Thu Aug 24 2023

Light to moderate northwest winds across the coastal waters
today with breezy winds this afternoon and evening through the San
Francisco Bay. Widespread breezy winds build Friday through the
beginning of next week, bringing steeper wind waves to the coastal
waters. A mix of northwesterly and southerly swells persists
through the week.

.MTR WATCHES/WARNINGS/ADVISORIES...

     evening for PZZ530.
