.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 145 AM PDT Thu Nov 2 2023

Dry weather will hold on for another couple days before a cold front
brings overcast skies, cooler max temperatures and light rain
to the Bay Area Saturday. This front will signal a change in the
pattern, and unsettled weather will keep a chance of rain in the
forecast through the middle of next week.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 145 AM PDT Thu Nov 2 2023

Another clear night will support cool morning temperatures. As we
saw the last couple days, quick warming is expected after sunrise.
Due to increasing cloud cover blow off from a cold front in
the East Pacific, the forecast max temperature this afternoon is
slightly cooler than the last couple days, but still roughly 5
degrees above normal. This cold front is not expected to maintain
much structure by the time it reaches the Bay Area, but there is a
slight chance of rain in the North Bay tonight. Light offshore winds
will continue to support dry conditions with low humidity today.

.LONG TERM...
(Friday through Wednesday)
Issued at 145 AM PDT Thu Nov 2 2023

Friday will be a transition day as the ridge and associated high
pressure finally start to get pushed around by the next approaching
cold front. It looks more and more like the rain will hold off
until Saturday morning, but the return of onshore flow should
allow a shallow marine layer to become established along the
coast. This will also bring up min temps. Max temps won`t take
much of a hit until Saturday when the cold front arrives.

Rain will start in the North Bay Saturday and progress south through
the weekend. While the models continue to disagree on the timing and
amount of rain, there is decent agreement that the jet stream will
migrate from far Northern California to the Bay Area over the
weekend. This will open the storm door, with a series of low
pressure systems and associated fronts bringing several
light rain events through the middle of next week. This continues to
look like a purely beneficial event, with light rain spread out over
several days.

Regarding the change to the precipitation forecast, the timing has
been delayed and weekend accumulation has decreased. Significant
uncertainty remains regarding how next week will play out, but
there does seem to be a moderate chance of rain persisting through
Tuesday. All told, the North Bay may see up to an inch from Sat-
Tue. During the same time, roughly 1/2 inch is expected in the SF
Peninsula, East Bay, and Santa Cruz, roughly 1/4 inch is expected
in the South Bay and northern Monterey County, and roughly 1/10
inch is expected in southern Monterey County and throughout San
Benito County. Global models are hinting that there will be a
couple dry days in the middle of the week, but that dry period may
be short lived.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 334 AM PDT Thu Nov 2 2023

VFR through much of the TAF period with mid-level clouds returning
tonight through Friday morning. A shortwave trough moving through
Friday morning will aid in bringing deeper moisture across the area.
As such, the marine layer is expected to deepen substantially
towards the end of the TAF period when more clouds are expected.
Moderate confidence that this will act to keep CIGs relatively
elevated as this initial disturbance moves through. Winds will
continue to be onshore, breezy 12-17 kts along coastal terminals and
near gap areas this afternoon. VCSH for North Bay terminals towards
the end of the TAF period, with what looks to be isolated showers at
this time.

Vicinity of SFO...VFR through today with low-to-mid clouds returning
early Friday morning as an initial disturbance moves through in the
form of a shortwave trough. Moderate confidence that CIGs will
remain elevated at the end of the TAF period due to the trough
deepening the marine layer. Winds turn onshore today and become
breezy NW to 15 kts this afternoon.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...Similar to the rest of the area, building
mid-level clouds through this evening with some extent of stratus
returning into Friday morning. As previously stated, moderate
confidence that CIGs remain elevated due to a deepening marine layer
as a shortwave trough moves through. SE drainage winds out of the
Salinas Valley during the mornings, otherwise light to breezy
onshore flow during the afternoons.

&&

.MARINE...
(Today through Tuesday)
Issued at 334 AM PDT Thu Nov 2 2023

Light northerly winds persist into the weekend. A new low pressure
system will bring rain chances beginning early Friday in the
northern waters. Rain chances then extend over the southern waters
as the weekend progresses, with winds turning briefly to become
southwesterly over the northern waters Saturday morning. Winds
then shift again to become more westerly early Sunday. Light
westerly swell with a moderate period continues through the
weekend along with a light, long period southerly swell in the
background.
