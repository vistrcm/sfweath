...New UPDATE...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 158 AM PDT Sat May 10 2025

Above normal temperatures today will give way to unsettled weather
in the form of below normal temperatures, strong and gusty onshore
winds, light rainfall, and a 10% chance for thunderstorms early
next week.

&&

.UPDATE...
Issued at 936 AM PDT Sat May 10 2025

Satellite imagery this morning shows some stratus lingering around
the Bay Area coasts, though the trend shows it dissipating from
interior areas. This has kept temperatures a few degrees cooler
for portions of Sonoma, Marin, San Francisco counties which could
alter the high temperature forecast by a few degrees for this
afternoon. Otherwise, the forecast looks to remain on track.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 158 AM PDT Sat May 10 2025

A Heat Advisory remains in effect through 9PM for the Southern
Salinas Valley. Hot conditions can cause heat illness if outdoors
for long periods, especially with physical exertion. Hydration is a
critical piece to mitigating the heat. Drink water, take breaks,
find shade, and if possible, help those who are vulnerable. The rest
of the region (at least away from the immediate coast) will
experience minor HeatRisk and should increase hydration, reduce time
spent outdoors or stay in the shade when the sun is strongest, and
open windows at night and use fans to bring cooler air inside
buildings. The culprit is an upper-level longwave ridge across the
Intermountain West. 850 millibar temperatures are a good proxy for
the air mass as a whole and this afternoon`s (May 10th 00Z) KOAK
sounding observed an 850 millibar temperature of 17.55 degrees
Celsius which is the 90th percentile for today`s date. As is typical
with high pressure and subsequently subsidence, a shallow marine
layer of 400 feet is being observed on the Fort Ord profiler with
stratus shown over Tomales Bay and along the San Francisco Peninsula
Coast. Temperatures will be 10 degrees above normal away from the
immediate coast with no records in jeopardy of being broken.

.LONG TERM...
(Sunday through Friday)
Issued at 158 AM PDT Sat May 10 2025

Heights begin to fall Sunday as an upper-level low develops off the
Pacific Northwest coast, nudging the upper-level longwave ridge to
the east. Sunday`s sensible weather will be 20 degrees cooler than
Saturday`s with strong onshore winds developing in the higher
terrain, gaps, and passes with gusts up to 40 mph to be expected.
Monday will even feel like a Monday weather wise (at least if you
don`t like Mondays or unsettled weather) with temperatures bottoming
out 10 degrees below normal, strong and gusty onshore winds, and
light rainfall for the Bay Area. A surface low will leave the post-
frontal environment with a low probability (10%)/high impact
threat for thunderstorms Tuesday. The necessary ingredients of
lift (cold front with upper-level support, vorticity maximum, 125
knot jet streak at 300 millibars), instability (warm, moist air
below cold, dry air), and moisture (precipitable water value of
0.70 inches) are there, but whether or not they align in time and
space will be the wild card. If a thunderstorm were to develop the
threats include lightning, small hail, and locally heavy rainfall
and gusty winds. The unsettled weather will result in the Oakland
Museum (OAMC1) forecast to approach its daily minimum temperature
records of 47 degrees set in 1974 on Tuesday and Wednesday and 48
degrees set in 1999 on Friday, the official forecast is 50, 50,
and 51 degrees respectively. Heights will be slow to rebuild and
thus temperatures will be slow to warm to seasonal normals
Wednesday through Friday as a Rex Block forms over the Eastern
Pacific Ocean.
