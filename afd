.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 131 AM PDT Sat Oct 28 2023

Gusty and dry offshore winds developing today across the Bay Area
and lasting into Sunday. This will bring critical fire weather
conditions with Red Flag warnings in effect for much of the
region. Colder overnight lows return tonight with freezing
temperatures possible for far southern Monterey County. Calmer
winds and warmer temperatures for the work week with small rain
chances by late week.

Key Messages:
* Critical fire weather concerns this weekend
* Dry and windy conditions develop today and last into Sunday
* Most critical period is tonight into Sunday morning
* Red Flag warnings for much of the Bay Area this weekend
* Wind Advisory for Bay Area higher elevations this weekend
* Do not burn outdoors as conditions are conducive to rapid fire
  spread

Technical Discussion:
The primary concern remains for critical fire weather conditions.
The synoptic picture is unchanged with an inside slider type setup
and robust surface pressure gradient as high pressure centers over
the Great Basin. The offshore pressure gradient (WMC-SFO) should
increase appreciably today, and exceed minus 12 mb between 03-18Z
Sunday. This places the core of the strongest winds juxtaposed
with the lowest humidity values from late tonight into early
Sunday as the gradient peaks around minus 15 to 16 mb. After that,
the gradient will begin relaxing into Sunday evening. Placing this
in context, these pressure gradient values are consistent to those
observed previously during moderate to strong offshore wind events
in the Bay Area. Timing remains similar with north-northeast winds
initially developing within the Sacramento Valley and adjacent
terrain this morning, before reaching the higher elevations within
the Bay Area during the morning to afternoon hours today. By
tonight the core of the strongest winds will push southwest
through the Bay Area with higher gusts potentially mixing down
into the lower elevations as well. Gusts should peak around 30-45
mph for most areas with the highest peaks reaching 60-70 mph
locally. These winds will transport extremely dry air into the
region allowing humidity values to drop into the 10-25 percent
range for much of the Bay Area on Sunday. This will bring critical
to near- critical fire weather conditions to much of the the Bay
Area and Red Flag Warnings/Wind Advisories are in effect
beginning as early as this morning and lasting into Sunday
evening. As previously noted, our cooler summer and winter rains
have allowed for heavier fuels to remain at non-critical levels.
So when compared to previous fire weather events our greatest
concern this time around lies in the finer, flashier, fuels such
as grasses and shrubbery. Regardless this is definitely a good
time to be "one less spark". Remember: one less spark, one less
wildfire.

Outside of fire weather concerns cold temperatures will again prevail
tonight with readings dipping into the 30s and 40s. The coldest
temperatures are expected across far southern Monterey County. In
fact, a consensus of forecast models suggest a 30% chance for
temperatures in this area to reach 32 degrees or colder. Given the
recent warm bias in overnight lows opted to collaboratively join LOX
in a Freeze Watch for southern portions of the Salinas Valley from
09-15Z (2AM - 8AM) Sunday. Remember to protect people, pets, plants
and pipes from the cold.

.LONG TERM...
(Sunday Night through Friday)
Issued at 131 AM PDT Sat Oct 28 2023

Temperatures should continue to warm as the inside slider moves off
to the east and an upper level ridge takes its place. High
temperatures for the upcoming work week will generally be in the mid
60s to low 70s along the coast, into the mid 70s to lower 80s for
the inland valleys. Inland low temperatures should gradually warm
from the low to mid 30s on Monday morning to the upper 40s to low
50s by Friday, with coastal lows remaining in the low to mid 50s
through the week.

The next chance for rain appears to arrive towards the latter part
of the week as a plume of moisture approaches the West Coast. As of
now, all available data suggests that the region will be on the
fringes of the plume of moisture, and that rain in our area will be
generally light. However, continuing model spread makes it hard to
pin down specifics. GFS ensemble output looks to favor a more
southerly solution as the bulk of the plume comes into Oregon and
the northern part of California, while the European ensemble favors
a more northerly solution as it aims the plume more towards
Washington state and Oregon. The forecast will become better refined
as the plume draws closer; interests in the North Bay and the SF Bay
Area should continue to monitor forecast updates.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 331 AM PDT Sat Oct 28 2023

Generally VFR this morning except for a few small patches of
stratus and fog. The only terminal experiencing periodic
visibility reductions in BR is KSTS, where conditions should
return to VFR later this morning. Otherwise high confidence in
VFR through the TAF period as breezy offshore winds increase today
into tonight. The strongest gusts are expected in the North and
East Bays through Sunday morning with LLWS developing for
KSTS/KAPC/KOAK/KLVK tonight into the first portion of Sunday.
Breezy offshore winds persist into Sunday afternoon before
gradually diminishing into Sunday night.

Vicinity of SFO... VFR. Breezy offshore winds developing this
afternoon and evening before decreasing into Sunday.

SFO Bridge Approach... Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...VFR. Northwest winds today with light
drainage winds later tonight.

.MARINE...
(Today through Thursday)
Issued at 331 AM PDT Sat Oct 28 2023

Northerly moderate to fresh breezes across the coastal waters
today, with strong breezes in the coastal jet south of Point Sur.
Near the coast, winds will be more northeasterly under the
offshore flow regime later tonight into Sunday. Light northwest
swell exists in the background through the first half of the week
at around 8 to 10 seconds, while a longer period southwesterly
swell of about 3 feet at 17 to 19 seconds persists through the
rest of the week. Winds become lighter over the seas early next
week, which poses no concerns for small crafts for the first half
of the work week.

.FIRE WEATHER...
Issued at 250 PM PDT Fri Oct 27 2023

Offshore wind setup still on track for the weekend.
Increasing confidence in slightly higher wind and lower RH values
through this event. Therefore, the Fire Weather Watch has been
upgraded to a Red Flag Warning. Ensemble guidance advertising the
SFO-WMC pressure gradient in the -13 to -15 mb range during the time
from about noon Saturday through noon Sunday, which is approaching
the 99th percentile. This set up promotes widespread offshore flow
with high confidence. Wind gusts along ridgetops expected to be in
the 40-50 mph range, with high confidence that a few of the favored
spots such as Mt. St. Helena and Mt. Diablo could see gusts to 60-70
mph. Minimum RH during the afternoons Saturday and Sunday will be in
the 10-15% range across much of the area as the downsloping offshore
winds increase. Overnight recoveries aren`t much better between 20-
40%. Any recovery overnight will occur early in the evening, then be
quickly eroded through the overnight and early morning hours by the
offshore winds. All things considered, this is shaping up to be a
high end event. Not quite on the extreme end of things, but
certainly at the upper end. In comparison with past events, October
2017 sticks out in recent memory. However, one key difference in the
2017 event was that the heavy fuels were much drier then. More on
this below.

The limiting factors with this event are related to the fuel
conditions and the degree of stability in the valleys. In regards to
the fuels, there is less concern in the more dense 100 and 1000 hour
fuels as much of the moisture is still retained from recent rains
and the cool summer. Much more concern lies in the finer, more
flashy fuels, such as grasses and shrubbery. There is more
certainty today that high winds from aloft will mix down into the
valleys, but the magnitude will be a little more uncertain as this
relies on an additional process to advect the winds down to lower
elevations. As such, we have gone ahead with expanding the Red
Flag Warning to include to valley floors and coastal areas along
the SF Peninsula and Sonoma/Marin counties.
