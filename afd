.SYNOPSIS...

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 138 AM PDT Sat Mar 30 2024

* Impactful weather system continues today
* Moderate water impacts from localized flooding possible
* Isolated thunderstorms with lightning and small hail
* Peak impacts late this morning into early this evening

A low pressure system was evident via moisture channel imagery just
offshore from the Bay Area early this morning. Scattered showers
were ongoing across the region within a cool and unstable post-
frontal regime. This low will remain our primary weather influencer
through tonight as it slowly drifts to the south. Shower coverage
will initially be area-wide this morning, with the greatest
chances by afternoon within two areas. The first will be from the
Golden Gate south around the periphery of the surface low. The
second will be across the North Bay in association with a surface
trough. Given steep lapse rates and pockets of surface heating
enough instability should exist for isolated thunderstorms today
as well. While a few storms are possible this morning
(particularlyover the waters) the best potential is from late
this morning into early this evening. Occasional lightning and
locally heavy rain are the primary concerns. And while additional
rainfall should be overall light (ranging from a few hundredths
over the North Bay to around 1" in the Santa Lucias), amounts will
be variable given the scattered nature of showers and storms
today. It`s worth noting that localized flooding concerns may
exist given the HREF ensemble members suggesting around a 10%
chance for seeing 1"+ over 3 hours from the Golden Gate south from
roughly late morning into early evening. Otherwise shower chances
will greatly wane by tonight as low pressure pulls away to our
south. Temperatures will remain seasonally cool with highs mostly
in the lower 60s. Lows tonight will be mostly in the 40s.

.LONG TERM...
(Sunday through Friday)
Issued at 138 AM PDT Sat Mar 30 2024

High pressure builds into the region with dry conditions and a
warming trend through mid week. Expect a cooling trend by late week
as troughing redevelops along the West Coast. Some light rain may
accompany this feature by late week as well.

(12Z TAFS)

VFR-MVFR including localized IFR conditions continuing today due
to scattered showers forming in a cold pool of air aloft associated
with a low pressure system center over the coastal and offshore
waters.

Vicinity of SFO...VFR-MVFR. Scattered showers continuing this
morning, decreasing to isolated showers today. East-southeasterly
winds becoming northeasterly to northwesterly this evening.

.MARINE...
(Today through Thursday)
Issued at 423 AM PDT Sat Mar 30 2024

A low pressure system over the California coastal and offshore
waters will continue moving toward southern California today and
tonight. Cold, unstable air with the low will result in additional
showers and a slight chance of thunderstorms today and tonight. A
high pressure system builds in behind the low late in the weekend
and early next week bringing drier, milder conditions to the area.
A separate, strengthening surface high pressure system south of
the Aleutian Islands early to mid next week will send a cold front
southeastward across the coastal waters and bays late Wednesday.
