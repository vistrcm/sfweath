.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 107 AM PST Sat Feb 17 2024

Warm sector rain has reached the North Bay coast this morning and
will continue to push south through the morning. A second, more
impactful storm arrives Sunday afternoon, bringing periods heavy
rain and strong southerly winds through Monday.

.SHORT TERM...
(Tonight through Saturday)
Issued at 1125 PM PST Fri Feb 16 2024

The radar is showing stratiform rain in the North Bay and
throughout the coastal waters. As expected, this rain looks to be
light to moderate in intensity with reflectivity at lowest
altitude mainly in the 20-30 dBZ range, indicating rain rates
less than 0.2" per hour. The Saturday rain forecast is mostly
unchanged with the North Bay expected to receive somewhere around
1" of rain, while the rest of the area stays closer to 1/2". The
coastal mountains are the exception, where orographic enhancement
should boost the totals into the 1-2" range. On the other hand,
inland valleys will be susceptible to the rain shadow effect, and
areas like San Jose may struggle to break 1/4". Southerly winds
will increase through the day as the cold front approaches. Gusts
are expected to reach near gale force along the coast in the
afternoon and evening. Rain and wind will taper off substantially
by midnight.

.LONG TERM...
(Sunday through Friday)
Issued at 107 AM PST Sat Feb 17 2024

Synoptic Overview:

Sunday morning will start with a reprieve as a high pressure
ridge temporarily builds in from the south. This will cause the
wind and rain to abate. This break won`t last long. By Sunday
afternoon a deep low pressure system currently north of Hawaii
will move into position off the coast of Northern California. This
is when things get interesting. This mature system will be north
of the jet stream on Sunday. When a storm becomes detached from
the jet stream, it comes with good news and bad news. The good
news is the system will lose its upper-level divergence, causing
the surface low to suffocate and the storm will begin to gradually
weaken. The bad news is that without jet support, the storm will
lose its steering flow and linger off the coast for a few days.

Rain:

As the low approaches the coast, it will pump tropical moisture
from the southwest. While rain is in the forecast from Sunday
through Wednesday, there are really 2 periods that will be the
most impactful. The first is the second half of Sunday as the
warm front moves through. Heavy rain, with a decent chance for
thunderstorms is expected through the evening and overnight hours.
This rain will be fairly continuous and it`s possible that 1/2 of
the weekly rainfall comes down in this 12-hour span. The second
period is on Monday as the cold front moves through. While the
rain doesn`t look as continuous, cooling upper levels will
destabilize the atmosphere creating another chance for
thunderstorms. This instability, combined with high wind shear,
has even caused some storm chasers to consider a trip to the
Sacramento Valley on Monday. When it`s all said and done the total
rain from Sunday through Wednesday is expected to be 1-2" in the
rainshadowed valleys, 2-4" in the majority of the area, and 4-6"
in the coastal mountains.

Wind:

Remember that ridge I mentioned in the first paragraph? That will
come back to bite us. The gradient between the low pressure off
the coast and the high pressure ridge will generate strong to near
gale force southerly winds on Sunday afternoon. While the low
will gradually weaken into Monday, it will also drift closer to
the coast, meaning strong southerly winds will return Monday,
particularly as the front moves through. In fact, the biggest
change to the forecast has been increasing the expected winds on
Monday afternoon, which now look at least as strong as Sunday`s
winds.

When will it end?

As the low weakens and moves off to the north, conditions will
gradually improve through Tuesday, though light rain will linger
through the day and may even extend into Wednesday morning. All
signs point to Thursday and Friday staying dry with mild
temperatures, light wind, and plenty of sunshine.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 332 AM PST Sat Feb 17 2024

Ceilings are beginning to drop into the MVFR category at STS, APC,
SFO, OAK, and will drop at the southern terminals within the next
few hours. Light rain will begin shortly at STS, but most other
terminals wont see the main band of rain start to move through
until 19 ot 20 UTC. SSE winds will aslo pick up mid-day, with
several TAFs forecasting gusts into the mid 20s. Ceilings will
continue to lower through the TAF period, and may flirt with IFR
by Sunday morning.

Vicinity of SFO...The timing of wind and rain impacts look to be
fairly well aligned, with MVFR visibility and moderate to strong
SSE winds in the afternoon. The big question mark is winds at SFO.
The TAF maxes out at 15011KT, showing deference to the GFSLAMP.
If the winds end up with more of an easterly component, they could
be coming over the Bay, and will surely be stronger.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...Holding on to VFR conditions for now, but
ceilings have already started to drop as the rain approaches. Both
MRY and SNS are expected to have light rain through the afternoon,
but only SNS should have strong winds. MRY is typically sheltered
from S winds, but the Salinas Valley actually enhances them.

.MARINE...
(Today through Thursday)
Issued at 332 AM PST Sat Feb 17 2024

An approaching cold front is bringing rain showers and increasing
southerly winds across the coastal waters today. As this front
approaches the coastline, strong southerly winds will progress
southward through the early afternoon Saturday. A large, long
period westerly swell will also propagate through the waters  this
weekend. The combination of gale force gusts and building  swell
will result in hazardous conditions for small and medium-  sized
vessels, with significant wave heights of 14-17 feet  expected.
Additional rain and gusty winds arrive along another  system
Sunday into early next week. Seas will remain elevated  through
Tuesday before gradually abating below 12 feet on  Wednesday.

.BEACHES...
Issued at 118 AM PST Fri Feb 16 2024

A high surf advisory is in effect from 10 AM Saturday through 4 PM
Sunday.

Incoming large westerly swell will arrive later this morning and
cause large breaking waves of 18 to 22 feet along exposed, west-
facing beaches. Locally higher waves of 28 feet are possible along
some favored areas with steep beaches. In addition to the
westerly swell, strong southerly winds will enhance the energy in
the surf zone, creating dangerous conditions for surfers and
swimmers. Inexperienced swimmer should remain out of the water.
All beachgoers are strongly encouraged to respect the power of the
ocean and reminded to never turn their back to the water. Large
waves can sweep across the beach without warning, pulling people
into the sea from rocks, jetties, and beaches. These waves can
also move large objects such as logs, crushing anyone caught
underneath.

.HYDROLOGY...
Issued at 118 AM PST Fri Feb 16 2024

A flood watch is in effect from 10 AM Sunday through 10 AM
Wednesday. Excessive runoff may result in flooding of rivers,
creeks, streams, and other low-lying and flood-prone locations.
Creeks and streams may rise out of their banks. Flooding may occur
in poor drainage and urban areas. While most main stem rivers are
forecast to remain below flood stage, minor flooding in urban
areas and along smaller creeks and streams is expected. A flood
watch means flooding is possible. Monitor the latest alerts for
possible flood warnings.

Soil moisture remains high from previous storms earlier this
month and will reach saturation this weekend. Once saturated,
additional rainfall will runoff resulting in moderate to rapid
rises on our creeks, streams, and rivers, as well as lead to
nuisance and/or minor flooding. Latest river forecasts from the
CNRFC depict an initial rise on area creeks, streams, and rivers
on Saturday and Saturday night with a larger rise on Monday and
Tuesday. The current ensemble guidance from the CNRFC indicates
the Russian River at Guerneville and the San Lorenzo River at Big
Trees have about a 20% chance of reaching flood stage in the next
5 days, while the Salinas River at Spreckels and Pajaro River at
Chittenden will be slower to crest and have about a 15% chance of
reaching flood stage in the next 10 days. Although most sites are
forecast to remain below flood stage, some locations may reach
monitor stage or minor flood stage.

USGS instrumentation throughout the San Francisco Bay Area
indicates that shallow soils on steep hillsides are approaching
saturation. This coupled with the forecasted precipitation means
shallow landslides are possible. Expect localized ponding of
water in low-lying or poorly drained areas, such as freeway
offramps.
