...New AVIATION...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 243 AM PDT Thu Sep 28 2023

Seasonable temperatures and breezy onshore winds expected today.
Rain is looking more probable across the area Friday into
Saturday with expected accumulations generally less than 0.25".
Warmer and drier conditions return briefly by midweek next week.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 243 AM PDT Thu Sep 28 2023

Marine layer inversion is redeveloping early this morning under more
stable conditions. 500 mb temps will continue to warm through the
day today, which will bring warmer, near seasonable daytime temps
across the area. Max temps this afternoon will be a few degrees
warmer compared to Wednesday across the interior. Expecting
another round of breezy onshore winds with locally gusty
conditions near the coast/coastal gaps.

.LONG TERM...
(Friday through Wednesday)
Issued at 243 AM PDT Thu Sep 28 2023

Upper low is on track to dig southward across the West Coast
Friday into Saturday as ridging across the E Pacific becomes more
amplified. Guidance continues to support a more westerly track as
this low digs south, resulting in wetter conditions and onshore
flow for our area. Confidence is increasing on widespread precip
chances. Over the last 24 hours, QPF and PoPs have trended higher
with widespread 30-50% PoPs in the forecast. Fri-Sat forecasted
rainfall amounts range from a few hundredths of an inch across the
North Bay to 0.3" over favored terrain across the Central Coast.
NBM has a 20-40% chance that the Bay Area and Central Coast get at
least 0.10" with highest chances across the Santa Cruz Mtns,
Diablo Range, and Santa Lucias.

In addition to rain chances, cooler air aloft from this deep low
will help to destabilize air Saturday morning, which has introduced
the slight chance of wet thunderstorms to the official forecast for
southern portions of the cwa. Stronger W/NW flow aloft, MUCAPE ~100-
300 J/Kg, and a passing vort max will favor highest chances for
storms (still low at 15%) across southern Monterey and San Benito
Counties early Sat. Post-frontal showers are possible Sunday
morning, but lower confidence for that scenario.

High pressure from the E Pacific will move east early to midweek
next week as upper low treks into the Great Basin, which will
prompt warmer and drier conditions by midweek.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 430 AM PDT Thu Sep 28 2023

Night fog satellite product shows patchy stratus across the Bay
Area while stratus is filling in and coverage is increasing over
the Monterey Bay region. MVFR cigs currently being observed at
KMRY/KSNS as well as KOAK. Intermittent fog was also observed
tonight across the North Bay, so tempo included for reduced vibsys
for KSTS/KAPC. Onshore winds will increase again this afternoon
with gusts of 15 to 20 kts across the area. VFR most likely
scenario for tonight into Friday morning. Any low clouds that do
form early Friday should stay mostly confined to the coastline.

Vicinity of SFO...Satellite shows low clouds scattering out west
of the terminal, but tempo for MVFR cigs still included from 13z
to 15z. KOAK remains under MVFR cigs until 16z. Marine layer north
of the terminal has struggled to reform (per Bodega Bay
profiler), so cigs may struggle to redevelop over SFO terminal.
NW winds will become breezy this afternoon with gusts up to 22
knots. Moderate confidence of cigs returning overnight tonight, so
SCT low clouds currently in for the end of the taf period.

SFO Bridge Approach...Bridge approach is currently clear. May see
low clouds from the East Bay trickle over through sunrise, but
should stay clear.

Monterey Bay Terminals...MVFR cigs persist through 15-16z. Breezy
onshore winds resume this afternoon. Low to moderate confidence of
cigs returning overnight tonight with strong northerly 925 mb
winds which may help to keep the Monterey Bay dry. If cigs do
form, it would be beyond the TAF period by later morning Friday.

.MARINE...
(Today through Tuesday)
Issued at 243 AM PDT Thu Sep 28 2023

Northwesterly winds continue to strengthen, with gales beginning
to develop over much of the outer waters and coastal jet regions.
Gales last through much of the day today, then weakening towards
late Friday morning to become fresh. Northwest swell continues to
diminish, though large wind waves build overnight tonight and
persist through the weekend. Both winds and waves will combine to
create dangerous conditions for small craft through the remainder
of the week. Chances of rain approach towards Saturday evening
with the arrival of a new low pressure system.
