.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 201 AM PDT Mon Mar 31 2025

Rain, wind, and a slight chance for thunderstorms through
tomorrow. Warming and drying trend kicks off Wednesday.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 201 AM PDT Mon Mar 31 2025

The last day of March will be pretty March-y as a cold front will
continue to trek across the region from northwest to southeast
through the morning hours. As a result, expect rainfall to increase
in coverage and intensity and southwesterly winds to strengthen and
veer. Rainfall totals up to 0.50" can be expected with locally
higher totals up to 1.00" expected in the North Bay Mountains and
along the Big Sur Coast. Widespread wind gusts of 20-30 mph, gusts
up to 45 mph in the higher terrain are expected. There`s a slight
(15%) chance for thunderstorms for most of the area through tomorrow
afternoon. As is typical for the region, a low CAPE high shear
regime can be expected with conditionally unstable lapse rates at
best. The driver seems to be post-frontal clearing allowing for the
surface to heat below recent cold air advection aloft making the
atmosphere unstable. If a thunderstorm were to develop, the primary
hazards will be lightning, locally heavy rainfall and gusty winds,
and small hail.

.LONG TERM...
(Tuesday through Sunday)
Issued at 201 AM PDT Mon Mar 31 2025

The parent low and an attendant coastal trough will sweep through on
Tuesday bringing with it widespread rainfall, gusty winds, and a
slight (15%) chance for thunderstorms. Widespread rainfall totals up
to 0.25" are expected with the higher terrain receiving up to 1.00".
Westerly winds will strengthen and veer through the day with
widespread wind gusts of 20-30 mph, up to 45 mph expected in the
higher terrain. Wednesday kicks off the warming and drying trend
as global ensemble clusters suggest it is likely that a ridge of
high pressure will build into the Eastern Pacific Ocean and drift
eastward through the week resulting in above normal temperatures
by the weekend.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 448 AM PDT Mon Mar 31 2025

A cold front will move through this morning, bringing periods of
light rain, strong WSW wind and a slight chance for thunderstorms
through the TAF period. Behind the front, there will be a break in
precipitation through the mid to late morning. In the afternoon
the precipitation mode will change to showers, with MVFR-VFR
ceilings and some sun breaks. Showers and gusty winds will
continue well into Tuesday.

&&

.MARINE...
(Today through Saturday)
Issued at 448 AM PDT Mon Mar 31 2025

A cold front is moving through the coastal zones bringing
scattered showers, strong westerly wind, and a slight chance for
thunderstorms through the day. By Tuesday, a large W-NW swell
will build as the strong breeze shifts from W to NW. Significant
wave heights will peak at around 15 feet Tuesday before subsiding
Wednesday.

Vicinity of SFO...MVFR-VFR CIGs for the majority of the morning.
The main band of early rain has already moved through and there
will be several dry hours with possible clearing before showers
return this afternoon. WSW winds will ramp up in the afternoon,
with occasional gusts to 30 kts expected. There is a slight chance
for thunderstorms this afternoon, but the confidence is far too
low to include in the TAF at this time. Similar disturbed weather
will continue through Tuesday.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO

Monterey Bay Terminals...MVFR-VFR CIGs through the morning with a
decreasing chance for rain. While the TAF shows an overall drying
trend, there will likely be a shower or two in the afternoon, but
they will be brief. Shower chances linger beyond the TAF period,
through at least Tuesday afternoon.
