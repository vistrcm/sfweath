...New SYNOPSIS, LONG TERM...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 456 AM PST Sat Dec 16 2023

A storm force low is spinning roughly 1,100 miles west of Southern
California. This system will pump moisture into the Bay Area,
triggering a rainy period from Sunday through Thursday.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 233 AM PST Sat Dec 16 2023

A meridional flow pattern prevailed this morning with a high
pressure ridge over much of the western states. An expansive low
pressure system was lurking well offshore with showers and isolated
thunderstorms ongoing over the Pacific waters. The Bay Area and
Central coast were located along the western periphery of the high
pressure ridge with quiet conditions outside of some cirrus clouds
streaming across the area. Winds were light and offshore thanks to
high pressure over the Great Basin providing a modest offshore
pressure gradient.

Today should be the last day of relatively quiet weather as high
pressure at the surface and aloft prevails. Outside of fairly
extensive high cloudiness this afternoon should be relatively mild
with high temperatures ranging from around 65-70 away from the
coast. Warmer spots like the Santa Clara Valley, the southern
Salinas Valley and areas around Pinnacles National Park should see
readings top out right around 75 or so.

Clouds will be on the increase tonight as the low pressure system
wobbles a bit closer to the region. That said the better moisture
tap from this system should remain well offshore. So while a few
showers remain possible over the waters and along the coast not
looking for anything meaningful for rain amounts during this
time. Overnight temperatures will be a bit milder given the
increased cloud cover with lows generally in the 40s with 50s
along the immediate coast.

.LONG TERM...
(Sunday through Friday)
Issued at 456 AM PST Sat Dec 16 2023

The most significant change to the forecast over the last 24 hours
has been a delayed onset of rain. The lastest guidance now
indicates the heavier showers wont arrive until Sunday afternoon.
Monday looks to be the most impactful day with stronger showers,
gusty southerly winds, and a slight chance for thunderstorms,
particularly in the North Bay. The instability looks decent, with
NAM projecting peak most unstable layer CAPE values above 500
J/kg at Santa Rosa when the warm front disturbance moves through.
There are some hindrances, however. Specifically the instability
is elevated in the mid levels and the surface based CAPE is
significantly lower. The storm prediction center has added
portions of the coastal North Bay to the general thunderstorm
outlook for Monday.

Beyond Monday, the rain will continue to linger, but the intensity
and winds will decrease. By Thursday, only light showers are
expected with dry weather returning Friday. The uncertainty
increases notably after Tuesday as the low pressure drifts
aimlessly towards Southern California later in the week.

The most challenging part of the forecast tonight was trying to
square the NBM probabilistic guidance with deterministic forecast
trends, other ensembles, historical context, and local forecaster
knowledge. While the NBM low end scenario seems more reasonable
with 0.5-1.0" across the region, the high end remains outrageous.
The NBM 90% percentile accumulation is suggesting widespread
totals of greater than 10 inches along the coast, with up to 24
inches in the Santa Lucia Mountains. Meanwhile the global
ensembles are showing a much tighter spread. Take SFO for example.
All 30 members of the GEFS and all 50 of the ECMWF EPS are
between 0.75 and 3.5 inches. Even in a historical context, San
Francisco has never experienced more than 10 inches of rain over
a 5 day period since record keeping began in 1849. To say that
there is a 10% chance that this system will bring more rain than
the area has seen since the gold rush era is just silly. A more
reasonable high end scenario is 3-5 inches for most coastal areas,
with 4-6 in the mountains and 2-3 in some of the rain shadow
areas. This is only about an inch above the deterministic
forecast, which lies on the high end of guidance.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 320 AM PST Sat Dec 16 2023

VFR outside of sporadic visibility restrictions at KSTS/KLVK
through about 16Z. Expect light offshore winds generally under 10
kt along with increasing high level clouds. Shower chances enter
the picture just beyond the current TAF cycle.

Vicinity of SFO...VFR with light offshore winds. Rain shower
chances on the increase beyond the current TAF cycle.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO

Monterey Bay Terminals...VFR. Overnight drainage winds trending
towards light and variable at KMRY this afternoon. Winds remain
E-SE at KSNS around 08-10 kt.

.MARINE...
(Today through Thursday)
Issued at 233 AM PST Sat Dec 16 2023

Unsettled weather is expected from late this weekend into next
week. A low pressure system will bring breezy southerly winds and
scattered to numerous rain showers late Sunday into Monday, with
shower chances persisting through late week. A few thunderstorms
are possible Sunday night into Monday. In addition to breezy winds
a large southwest swell will arrive Sunday night along with the
storm system.
