.SHORT TERM...
Issued at 212 AM PDT Wed Jul 2 2025
(Today and tonight)

For a few days now we`ve been talking about a non-zero chance for
thunderstorms over the North Bay Tuesday evening into Wednesday
morning. So, how`s that playing out? Well, radar has been put into
surveillance mode as it`s not detecting any storms. Synoptically
speaking, we still have an upper low spinning overhead. Spokes of
moisture continue to rotate around the low with a few moisture
pockets traversing the North Bay. Satellite imagery even shows
some of the moisture. LAtest guidance still shows decent
instability and moisture. However, one change from yesterday to
today is the moisture and instability is overlapping with a higher
amount of CINH or inhibition. Additionally, flow aloft at jet
stream level is less divergent and more convergent. We`ll the
situation isn`t favorable for thunderstorms we`ll still be keeping
an eye on it.

Otherwise, marine layer is once again in control with profilers
putting the depth near 1200-1500 feet. Patchy drizzle and fog have
been added to the coastal regions this morning. Marine layer will
once again roll back to the coast by mid-morning with inland
sunshine. Temperatures will be seasonably cool. Marine layer will
move inland again tonight with another round of drizzle/fog.

.LONG TERM...
Issued at 240 AM PDT Wed Jul 2 2025 (Thursday through Tuesday)

The former upper low is now a open wave by Thursday with its
sights on the Four Corners region. In its wake, another sharper
upper level trough takes aim at CA. While dry for the forecast
area, the trough will usher in slightly cooler temperatures and
much windier conditions on Thursday. Not strong enough for a wind
advisory, but gusts of 25-40 mph will be possible over the
waters, coastal areas, higher terrain, and inland gaps/passes.

For the upcoming holiday, expect seasonably cool conditions
remains with night/morning clouds with afternoon inland sunshine.

Broad upper level troughing remains Friday and into the weekend
making for a rinse and repeat forecast.
