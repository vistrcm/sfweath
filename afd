.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 145 AM PDT Thu Oct 19 2023

Heat Advisories are in effect for much of the region into tonight.
This should be the warmest day, with a cooling trend for Friday
into next week. Hazardous beach and marine conditions are expected
today with high surf and dangerous currents expected for
beachgoers. Shower chances return to the region on Saturday night
into Sunday.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 145 AM PDT Thu Oct 19 2023

Expansive high pressure aloft was centered over the central Great
Basin this morning with upper troughing just east of northern Baja.
Surface analysis revealed low-level thermal troughing along the CA
coast with surface high pressure across much of the interior west.
The upper high should hold court today with some erosion along its
western flank. This will occur as the upper low treks north to
locate offshore from SoCal later today. This pattern change will
promote a greater onshore wind component later today with a
southerly wind reversal traveling north along the Big Sur coast
towards Monterey Bay during the late morning to early afternoon
hours. The primary forecast concern remains temperatures which will
be on the hot side today. It`s already quite warm in the hills this
morning with many locations above 1500 feet reporting 1 AM
temperatures in the mid to upper 70s. While the valley floors are
considerably cooler, expect light offshore/downsloping winds to
persist through the morning with compressional heating maximized
into the early afternoon. This will bring a quick warmup with highs
reaching the 80s to around 90 along the coast, with mid to upper 90s
inland. These temperatures will produce a moderate to high HeatRisk
across the region with Heat Advisories in place for most areas into
tonight. And while it will be warm today forecast temperatures are
not a slam dunk for coastal locations. There are some indications of
an earlier seabreeze arrival with the RAP/HRRR shifting winds
onshore in downtown San Francisco by 20Z/1PM PDT. A southerly wind
reversal also looks to bring onshore winds into portions of Monterey
Bay and the northern Salinas Valley around 18-20Z/11AM-1PM PDT. For
now, continued leaning towards the warmer side for max temperature
guidance today with the idea of a quick warmup before winds turn
onshore. That said, a possible earlier onshore push could temper
readings a bit below the official forecast values if realized. Stay
tuned for updates as we watch things unfold later today. Regardless,
it temperatures will be well above average and will pose a risk for
heat sensitive populations. A few safety tips to remember are:

* Stay hydrated and drink plenty of fluids.
* Wear lightweight, light-colored clothing.
* Reduce time spent outdoors or stay in the shade.
* Never leave people or pets unattended in vehicles.

Light onshore winds will persist into at least the first portion of
the evening before light offshore drainage flow takes hold. Given
the moist boundary layer locally dense fog development may occur
within a compressed marine layer, although there is some
uncertainty. Right now the best chances for fog (should it occur)
are along the Monterey Bay shoreline and perhaps within the Sonoma
Valley. Overnight temperatures will remain mild, but should be a bit
cooler compared to the previous 24 hours. Look for lows mostly in
the mid to upper 50s with 60s in the hills. Mostly clear skies
should prevail away from the immediate coast and bays.

.LONG TERM...
(Friday through Wednesday)
Issued at 145 AM PDT Thu Oct 19 2023

The aforementioned upper low should devolve to an open-wave trough
while lifting across the Bay Area on Friday. This will bring
steadier onshore flow along with a return to cooler temperatures.

A stronger trough will swing through the Bay Area and Central Coast
late Saturday into Sunday. This system has trended a bit wetter and
more dynamic with showers expected during this time. Given some
elevated instability couldn`t rule out a thunderstorm or two on
Saturday night, with the greatest odds favoring the local waters.
Shower chances may linger into late Sunday. Cool weather should
prevail through early next week as a closed upper low drops south
through CA.

The upper pattern remains progressive with another system bringing
some low-end shower chances back to the region towards mid week.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 429 AM PDT Thu Oct 19 2023

Prevailing VFR for most locations through the TAF period. Periodic
visibility reductions are possible in BR later this morning at
KSTS/KAPC but any impacts appear minimal. Light/dry drainage flow
should preclude fog development around KMRY/KSNS although there
remains a low potential (less than 20 percent) for some patchy FG
around as the offshore winds weaken this morning. Light offshore
winds this morning become onshore during the mid to late
afternoon hours today.

Vicinity of SFO...VFR. Light and variable winds this morning with
a NE component most likely. Light onshore winds developing by late
afternoon. Slight chance of stratus return early Friday morning,
but low confidence given shallow marine layer.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO

Monterey Bay Terminals...Prevailing VFR. Small potential for
patchy FG development through this morning but light/dry offshore
winds make VFR the most likely forecast outcome through sunrise.
Light onshore winds develop by mid to late afternoon.

.MARINE...
(Today through Tuesday)
Issued at 429 AM PDT Thu Oct 19 2023

Long period northwest swell around 16 to 18 seconds at 10 to 13
feet continues to move through the waters through at least Friday
afternoon. This NW swell train begins an abatement trend towards
late Friday, with period and wave heights slowly becoming more
moderate at 14 seconds and below, and lasts through mid next week.
Otherwise, by Saturday morning, chances of light rain begin to
appear for much of the waters as a new low pressure system moves
in, with rain chances decreasing by the end of the weekend.
Gentle to moderate N/NW winds expected through early Sunday, then
increasing to become fresh to strong into late Sunday.

&&

.BEACHES...
Issued at 324 AM PDT Wed Oct 18 2023

A long period northwest swell will bring hazardous conditions for
beachgoers in the form of sneaker waves and large surf. An
enhanced risk for rip currents will also exist. Conditions will
deteriorate with the peak of the wave activity arriving on
Thursday. High surf will persist into Friday before subsiding. Use
extreme caution and remain out of the water to avoid hazardous
swimming conditions. Remember to never turn your back on the
ocean.
