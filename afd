.SHORT TERM...
Issued at 1231 AM PST Fri Nov 21 2025
(Today and tonight)

Radar returns continue to show isolated showers lingering across
interior San Benito County as an upper level low exits to our
south. Those showers should continue to diminish through the rest
of the night and dissipate entirely by sunrise today, which will
be drier and clearer than the last couple of days. The morning
should dawn clear and bright across the Bay Area, with lingering
clouds and potentially fog over the South Bay and Central Coast
dissipating before the afternoon. High temperatures today reach
the upper 50s to middle 60s in the lower elevations, barring the
North Bay valleys where highs reach the upper 60s, while the
higher elevations drop into the lower to middle 50s.

.LONG TERM...
Issued at 1231 AM PST Fri Nov 21 2025
(Saturday through Thursday)

The exiting upper level low will allow a ridging pattern to settle
in across the western United States, ushering in a drier pattern
that should persist into the middle of next week and the
Thanksgiving holiday. A shallow marine layer should redevelop on
Saturday, but weak easterly flow aloft will keep marine layer
stratus from coming inland. High temperatures continue to hover
in the upper 50s to middle 60s for the lower elevations through
the middle of the week, near or up to 5 degrees above the seasonal
average for this time of year.

The next chance for rain arrives towards the end of next week,
particularly the day after Thanksgiving into the following weekend.
Ensemble member cluster analysis hints at an upper level trough
developing off the West Coast and bringing rain chances to the
state. As of now, the ensemble members are split roughly 50-50
between those showing a more pronounced trough over the West Coast
and those that show more zonal flow or possibly even a ridge over
the region. The CPC`s 6-10 day outlook shows a lean to precipitation
totals near the seasonal average for a period from the 26th to the
30th. For context, looking at the historical averages, around half
an inch of rain would fall in downtown San Francisco during this
period.

Issued at 327 PM PST Thu Nov 20 2025

A Beach Hazards Statement is in effect through Monday evening. A
long period northwesterly swell will result in an increased risk
for sneaker waves and rip currents. Breaking waves of 13 to 18

stronger in the vicinity of jetties, inlets, and piers.
