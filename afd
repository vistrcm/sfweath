.SHORT TERM...
Issued at 257 AM PDT Sat Sep 20 2025
(Today and tonight)

Water vapor satellite imagery this morning shows an upper low
sitting off the coast of CA, with fairly dry air overhead.
Additional pictures from space show pockets of stratus trying to fill
into some valleys. Outside of that, fairly quiet weather is forecast
for today with a warming trend kicking off. Highs today upper 70s to
mid 80s for most interior locations with the exception being
interior Monterey and San Benito counties where the low 90s are
possible. For those near the coast, highs will range from the 60s to
mid 70s.

.LONG TERM...
Issued at 257 AM PDT Sat Sep 20 2025
(Sunday through Friday)

Some minor changes in the long term. The upper level pattern will
gradually shift late Sunday into Monday with the upper level low
deepening off the southern coast of CA and upper level ridge
trying to nose into NorCal. This will lead to continued warming
through Monday, before ridging gives way to the closed low and
moving into southern CA. As of right now, the forecast looks to be
dry into early next week, with perhaps some light offshore winds
Monday into Tuesday. The next chance for showers or isolated
thunderstorms looks to be Tuesday into Wednesday, as the low moves
onshore and pulls moisture into the region.
