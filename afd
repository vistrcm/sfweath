...New AVIATION, MARINE...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 121 AM PDT Wed Jun 26 2024

A cooling trend begins today with temperatures mostly at, or
slightly below normal for this time of year. Thursday will see
temperatures drop another few degrees for most locations, especially
inland. A warmup looks likely for the beginning of next week, when a
pattern change results in upper level ridging across our region.

&&

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 121 AM PDT Wed Jun 26 2024

Low stratus has begun to edge farther inland, with further intrusion
into the Salinas Valley in the Central Coast, East Bay, and the
North Bay vallies of Petaluma, Sonoma and Napa. Some patchy fog can
be expected near the coast in southern Santa Cruz county early this
morning as well. The low clouds will persist through late this
morning/early afternoon. Breezy winds can be expected this afternoon
as a trough axis approaches from the west. Today is the beginning of
a pleasant cool down with temperatures mostly at or slightly below
normal. Thursday will see temperatures drop a few more degrees,
especially further inland as the trough axis shifts east across our
area, with decreasing H50 heights and thicknesses.

&&

.LONG TERM...
(Thursday through Tuesday)
Issued at 121 AM PDT Wed Jun 26 2024

Temperatures at or slightly below normal will persist through the
end of the work week into the weekend. A low amplitude progressive
ridge will be overhead on Friday with little impact on temperatures.
A sharpening trough moving onshore will keep high temperatures
similar Saturday and Sunday. Once the aforementioned trough shifts
east of our area Sunday night, a ridging pattern will set in for the
beginning of next week. Inland temperatures will jump 5-10 degrees
from Sunday to Monday, with the warmer temperatures expected to
persist through the remainder of the extended forecast and beyond.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 422 AM PDT Wed Jun 26 2024

Currently LIFR at MRY and STS, IFR at OAK, SFO, and SNS, and VFR at
APC, LVK, and SJC. Widespread VFR will prevail by this afternoon.
Winds will remain onshore through the TAF period. MRY, OAK, SFO, and
SNS are expected to experience similar conditions overnight
although slightly improved as a trough moves through the region
and deepens the marine layer.

Vicinity of SFO...Currently IFR with westerly flow. Winds will
prevail out of the west through the TAF period. VFR will prevail by
late morning with moderate confidence on a low-end MVFR ceiling
returning to the terminal early tomorrow morning.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...Currently LIFR with westerly flow at MRY
and IFR with northwesterly flow at SNS. Winds will prevail out of
the west through the TAF period. The terminals will briefly improve
to VFR late this morning/early this afternoon. Low clouds are
expected to linger through the TAF period with moderate confidence
on both terminals getting some form of a low-end MVFR/IFR ceiling
again tonight.

.MARINE...
(Today through Monday)
Issued at 422 AM PDT Wed Jun 26 2024

  Building surface high pressure over the Eastern Pacific Ocean
will move east, tightening the pressure gradient and thus
increasing the winds. Strong northwesterly breezes with gusts
approaching gale force will prevail for most of the period. Wind
is the main  driver for the Small Craft Advisories as significant
wave heights  generally remain below 10 feet through the period.
