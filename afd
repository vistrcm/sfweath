.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 120 AM PDT Mon Jun 26 2023

Upper troughing nearby will lead to below normal temperatures and
onshore winds through midweek. Temperatures warm to above normal
by week`s end as high pressure gradually builds into the region.
Hot temperatures are likely for interior areas into early July.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 120 AM PDT Mon Jun 26 2023

It`s a synoptic pattern on repeat. An upper level trough will
prevail from NorCal through the Pacific Northwest with stout ridging
centered over the Southern Plains and northern Mexico. Modest
onshore flow persists with the SFO-SAC pressure gradient averaging
around 2.5 to 3 mb early this morning. Low stratus was located
across much of the area with patchy high clouds occuring in
association with an upper jet. The forecast for today relies on
persistence, with clouds gradually clearing towards the coast during
the late morning to early afternoon hours. Onshore winds will have a
cooling effect on temperatures, with afternoon highs ranging from 60-
70 degrees along the coast and within the marine influenced valleys,
with the warmest interior spots reaching the 70s to around 80. These
temperatures will be a good 5-15 degrees below the seasonal
averages. Expect low stratus to make an early evening return with
clouds quickly spilling inland around the coast and bays overnight
given a relatively deep marine layer.

.LONG TERM...
(Tuesday through Sunday)
Issued at 120 AM PDT Mon Jun 26 2023

The persistent upper trough will slowly migrate inland through mid
week. Expect onshore flow, coastal clouds, and below normal
temperatures initially, with readings trending to near normal by mid
week.

A long awaited pattern change is expected late this week into next
weekend. Troughing will exit, with high pressure expanding
northwestward from northern Mexico towards the West Coast. This
should enhance our warming trend with temperatures climbing above
normal for inland areas by early next week. Model ensembles and WPC
clusters are in agreement with this scenario, but differ somewhat in
the strength and placement of the upper ridge. So while the exact
temperature details remain a little fuzzy, it will be warm. And
considering how cool it`s been across the region hot days so far
have been few and far between. Therefore it`s a good idea to start
thinking about heat safety, especially in light of the upcoming
holiday with more people spending time outdoors. Stay hydrated, take
cooling breaks, and remember to never leave people or pets
unattended in locked vehicles. Warm temperatures may stick around
beyond the 4th with high pressure likely to remain somewhere
nearby.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 432 AM PDT Mon Jun 26 2023

IFR conditions prevail across most terminals early this morning.
Cigs expected to lift as the morning progresses, improving to MVFR
by mid morning. VFR is expected after 18z for inland terminals
(KSJC, KLVK) and later between 19-20z for coastal terminals.
Models hinting at a slightly quicker clearing time compared to
yesterday, but will continue to monitor this morning. W/NW winds
expected today, becoming slightly windier compared to yesterday
with gusts around 25 knots during the afternoon. MVFR cigs return
in this evening, lowering to IFR overnight across most terminals.

Looking ahead, trough pattern continues through midweek over CA
but slowly weakens as high pressure builds in, which will help to
compress the marine layer.

Vicinity of SFO...Borderline IFR-MVFR cigs persist heading into
sunrise. Cigs will lift later this morning, becoming MVFR before
scattering out by 19z. W/NW winds will increase this afternoon,
with gusts up to 25 knots possible this afternoon. MVFR cigs
expected again this evening with moderate confidence on timing of
return.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...IFR cigs will continue through mid
morning with slight chance of KMRY dipping into LIFR cig
territory in the next few hours. Cigs lift to MVFR before low
clouds scatter out to VFR between 19-20z. Onshore winds resume
this morning, becoming breezy during the afternoon with gusts up
to 20 knots possible. MVFR cigs return early this evening between
00-01z, likely lowering to IFR again overnight.

.MARINE...
(Today through Saturday)
Issued at 246 AM PDT Mon Jun 26 2023

Gusty northerly winds will continue through the upcoming week,
becoming stronger during the afternoon and evening hours. Near
gale conditions possible this evening over the northern waters.
Expect building steep seas as a result of these winds, creating
hazardous conditions for small craft vessels. By midweek, more
widespread gale force gusts possible over the northern waters. A
longer period southwesterly swell will move into the waters
midweek.
