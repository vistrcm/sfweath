.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 1224 AM PDT Sun Jun 25 2023

Upper troughing nearby will lead to below normal temperatures and
onshore winds through midweek. Temperatures warm to near normal by
week`s end as high pressure gradually builds into the region.

&&

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 1224 AM PDT Sun Jun 25 2023

The large-scale pattern remains relatively unchanged with upper
troughing from NorCal into the Pacific Northwest and stout ridging
centered over northern Mexico. Modest onshore flow persists with the
SFO-SAC pressure gradient averaging around 3 mb early this morning.
Low stratus was blanketing much of the Bay Area and southern
Monterey Bay with patchy high level clouds occuring in association
with an upper jet. The forecast picture for today should be a
familiar one, with clouds clearing towards the coast during the late
morning hours and afternoon sunshine for most areas. However despite
the sunshine inland heating will only strengthen onshore winds this
afternoon and evening and this will have quite the moderating effect
on temperatures. Highs today will generally range from 60-70 degrees
along the coast and within the marine influenced valleys, with a few
of the warmest interior spots reaching the 70s to perhaps around 80.
These temperatures will be a good 5-15 degrees below the seasonal
averages. Expect low stratus to make an early evening return with
clouds quickly spilling inland around the coast and bays overnight
given a relatively deep marine layer.

.LONG TERM...
(Monday through Saturday)
Issued at 1224 AM PDT Sun Jun 25 2023

The persistent upper trough will slowly migrate inland through mid
week. Expect onshore flow, coastal clouds, and below normal
temperatures initially, with readings trending to near normal by mid
week.

A long awaited pattern change is expected late this week into next
weekend. Troughing will exit, with high pressure expanding
northwestward from northern Mexico towards the West Coast. This
should enhance our warming trend with temperatures climbing above
normal for inland areas by early next week. Model ensembles and WPC
clusters are in agreement with this scenario, but differ somewhat in
the strength and placement of the upper ridge. So while the exact
temperature details remain a little fuzzy, it will be warm. And
considering how cool it`s been across the region hot days so far
have been few and far between. Therefore it`s a good idea to start
thinking about heat safety, especially in light of the upcoming
holiday with more people spending time outdoors. Stay hydrated, take
cooling breaks, and remember to never leave people or pets
unattended in locked vehicles. Warm temperatures may stick around
beyond the 4th with high pressure likely to remain somewhere
nearby.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 429 AM PDT Sun Jun 25 2023

Widespread MVFR and localized IFR continue through the late
morning into afternoon today. Inland terminals will clear to VFR
this morning between 17-18z, while coastal terminals will take
longer to clear (between 19-21z). Upper level trough over the
region will keep marine layer deep and winds onshore. Onshore
gradient is expected increase again during the afternoon (SFO- SAC
+3 to +4 mb). With this, high confidence in another round MVFR
cigs arriving early in the evening. Westerly winds continue
through the taf period, becoming breezy to occasionally gusty
during the afternoon.

Vicinity of SFO...MVFR cigs will persist to at least 20-21z this
afternoon. Some guidance (ie NAM, LAMP) show that SFO will not
clear to VFR at all during the TAF period, so that remains a
possibility. However, higher confidence in persistence and high
res guidance which signals for some brief clearing to VFR through
the afternoon. MVFR cigs will return to SFO as early as 02z and
will persist overnight tonight into Monday morning. West winds
continue with gusts up to 22 knots this afternoon.

SFO Bridge Approach...Bridge approach will likely clear earlier
than the terminal as low clouds erode from the south.

Monterey Bay Terminals...MVFR cigs will linger through 18-20z,
clearing first at KSNS. Onshore winds will become breezy tomorrow
afternoon and gusty through the Salinas Valley. Brief VFR during
late afternoon. MVFR cigs return as early as 02-03z today.

.MARINE...
(Today through Friday)
Issued at 215 AM PDT Sun Jun 25 2023

Breezy northerly winds continue overnight over the northern outer
waters. By later this afternoon, northerly winds will strengthen
along favored coastal jets. These stronger winds will spread to
the outer waters late tonight into Monday, persisting across the
waters through the upcoming work week. Strongest winds will exist
across the northern outer waters, where occasional gale force
gusts may be possible late Monday, resulting in hazardous seas and
steep wind waves. New long period southerly swell and moderate
period, light northwesterly swell arrives Monday.
