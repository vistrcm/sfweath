.SHORT TERM...
Issued at 132 AM PDT Tue Oct 21 2025
(Today and tonight)

Current satellite shows southerly surge of moisture and associated
stratus pushing into the Monterey Bay region and up the coast of
Santa Cruz and San Mateo counties. These locations can expect areas
of dense fog this morning. The marine layer is still very compressed
along the coast and well mixed inland thanks to weak offshore flow,
so expect another day of mostly clear skies and dry conditions. The
offshore pressure gradient begins to reverse ahead of a pattern
change slated to take place starting this evening. Deep moisture
from an EPac upper low begins advecting into the region this
evening, first made apparent by increased mid-to-upper level
cloud cover. Good surface moisture spreads much further inland
tonight with RH 70-100% region-wide and PWAT approaching 1" by
Wednesday morning (approx 160% of normal for this time of year).
Deep moisture and marginal lift associated with this upper low
will potentially lead to a few isolated showers and thunderstorms
overnight tonight into Wednesday morning. Weak flow aloft doesn`t
promote much in the way of large-scale forcing, and there is still
a hint of a dry layer between the moisture aloft and surface
moisture. While these aren`t terribly noteworthy alone, we are
keeping the mention of dry lightning simply because any rain that
does fall will likely be below the wetting rain definition of
0.1". Highest likelihood for these impacts to occur looks to be
interior Monterey and San Benito counties, coastal waters off the
Central Coast and Santa Clara, San Mateo, and Santa Cruz counties.
Any shower and thunderstorm activity that does occur should be
winding down by just after sunrise Wednesday. Despite a slight
risk for dry lightning, overall fire risk remains on the lower end
given the moist fuels and recent wetting rains last week.

.LONG TERM...
Issued at 132 AM PDT Tue Oct 21 2025
(Wednesday through Monday)

By Friday evening, we see our second wave in our big pattern shift.
A deep, longwave trough is progged to dig out of the Gulf of Alaska
into the PNW. Global ensemble guidance is advertising very good
agreement in the timing and overall evolution of this pattern.
However, one trend in the forecast has been the northward jog of
highest moisture transport. The result is sharp decline in the total
amount of rainfall expected through the weekend. Highest totals
still expected well north of us, and we may even see a situation
where areas south of the Bay Area don`t pick up any rain at all from
this system. Nevertheless, cooler temps and higher RH will note a
change in the season.

.AVIATION...
(18Z TAFS)
Issued at 938 AM PDT Tue Oct 21 2025

LIFR conditions persist this morning around the Monterey Bay
terminals and coastal locations around KHAF. Meanwhile, VFR
conditions prevail elsewhere. Low clouds and fog will begin to
dissipate by around 18Z or shortly thereafter, except the immediate
coastline. Southwesterly winds will increase this afternoon and may
become northwesterly by the late afternoon before easing into
Wednesday morning. Moderate to high confidence for low clouds to
return late this evening around the Monterey Bay terminals  and
North Bay. Moderate confidence for MVFR ceilings to return to the
Bay Area terminals early Wednesday morning. Ceilings are forecast to
lift through midmorning on Wednesday as increasing mid-to-high level
approach the region.

Vicinity of SFO...VFR. Southwesterly winds increase this afternoon
before easing into Wednesday morning. MVFR ceilings are forecast to
return early Wednesday morning and continue through midmorning
before ceilings start to lift by 18-21Z Wednesday.

SFO Bridge Approach...Lower probability of seeing MVFR
ceilings on Wednesday morning. Otherwise, similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...Low ceilings and visibilities will improve
in the next hour or so resulting in VFR conditions through the
afternoon. Moderate to high confidence for IFR to MVFR ceilings
and/or visibilities to return by this evening and persist through
midmorning Wednesday. Visibilities may drop down to LIFR early
Wednesday morning.

.MARINE...
(Today through Sunday)
Issued at 938 AM PDT Tue Oct 21 2025

Winds and seas remain light through the day with winds becoming
southerly by this evening. A new long period northwest swell
arrives this evening and spreads across the waters through
Wednesday, with additional swells arriving Thursday night. Wet
weather conditions return by Friday and continue into the upcoming
weekend as a storm system approaches from the north.

.BEACHES...
Issued at 425 AM PDT Tue Oct 21 2025

The Beach Hazards Statement has been extended out in time through
3 AM Thursday as a moderate to long period northwesterly swell
impacts all of the Bay Area and Central Coast beaches. Swell
heights will ramp up through the day, peaking tonight into
Wednesday, with lingering impacts Wednesday evening through early
Thursday morning across the Central Coast. These conditions will
result in breaking waves of 15 to 20 feet and up to or exceeding
25 feet at favored break points such as Mavericks. Never turn your
back to the ocean! Swim near a lifeguard if possible! If caught
in a rip current, swim parallel to shore until you escape its
influence.
