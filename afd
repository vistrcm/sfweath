...New UPDATE, MARINE...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 157 AM PDT Tue May 6 2025

Warm and dry conditions through Friday, unsettled weather returns
over the weekend.

&&

.UPDATE...
Issued at 844 AM PDT Tue May 6 2025

As the offshore winds diminish, a southerly surge has brought the
marine layer back to the coast. The Ft. Ord profiler is showing
the height has quickly deepened to around 2,200 feet. In the Bay
Area, the stratus deck has stayed mostly offshore, outside of
the north Bay coast. By tomorrow, NNW onshore winds will return,
causing more typical marine layer stratus coverage in the morning.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 157 AM PDT Tue May 6 2025

Order has been restored with Wind Advisory criteria no longer being
met across the region. The upper-level pattern shows a reinforcing
trough in the Great Basin nudging the cut-off low over the Southwest
to the east. As a result, offshore flow will likely linger in the
higher terrain today even as surface pressure gradients weaken.
Temperatures will be near to slightly above normal for areas away
from the coast with Minor HeatRisk to show for it. The marine layer
has begun to reestablish itself with a 600 foot observation coming
in on the Fort Ord Profiler. Satellite shows a southerly surge
feeding into Monterey Bay; as a result, expect low clouds and
visibilities in the region through the morning.

NWS Minor HeatRisk:

- Heat of this type is tolerated by most; however there is a minor
  risk for extremely heat-sensitive groups to experience negative
  heat-related health effects.

- For those at risk, actions that can be taken: increase
  hydration, reduce time spent outdoors or stay in the shade when
  the sun is strongest, and open windows at night and use fans to
  bring cooler air inside buildings.

.LONG TERM...
(Wednesday through Monday)
Issued at 157 AM PDT Tue May 6 2025

Global ensemble clusters are in good agreement through Friday with
upper-level ridging building across the West. Friday is forecast to
be the warmest day of the week with temperatures up to 20 degrees
above average with moderate HeatRisk in the Southern Salinas Valley
and minor HeatRisk elsewhere. Subsidence aloft will allow for a
shallow marine layer to bring low clouds and visibilities to coastal
areas during this time. Uncertainty creeps in Saturday when global
ensemble clusters diverge on whether the upper-level ridge continues
to build in for one last day or if heights begin to fall. More
specifically, the uncertainty can be boiled down to the amplitude
and strength of the upper-level trough. A longer and stronger
solution will bring more impacts to the region than a shorter and
weaker solution. The aforementioned uncertainty will be compounded
into the timing, but nonetheless expect a noticeable change in
sensible weather over the weekend with cool and windy conditions,
an increase in cloud cover, and a slight chance for rain in the
North Bay.

NWS Moderate HeatRisk:

- Heat of this type is tolerated by many; however there is a moderate
  risk for members of heat-sensitive groups to experience
  negative heat-related health effects, including heat illness.
  Some risk for the general population who are exposed to the sun
  for longer periods of time. For those without air conditioning,
  living spaces can become uncomfortable during the afternoon and
  evening, but fans and leaving windows open at night will help.

- For those at risk, actions that can be taken: reduce time in the
  sun during the warmest part of the day, stay hydrated, stay in a
  cool place during the heat of the day, move outdoor activities
  to cooler times of the day, for those without a/c, use fans to
  keep air moving and open windows at night.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 524 AM PDT Tue May 6 2025

Mainly VFR conditions prevail with the exception being the stratus
crawling up the coast and socking in the Monterey Bay and portions
of the interior valleys of the central coast. Expect conditions to
gradually improve for those areas through the morning, with perhaps
stratus filling in around KHAF later this morning. Outside of those
notes, VFR conditions should prevail until the stratus tries to
surge inland later this evening. Guidance favors MVFR to IFR cigs
for North Bay terminals, Monterey Bay terminals, and KHAF. There are
some hints that KSFO and KOAK will see the stratus sneak into their
domain. Most guidance suggests East and South Bay terminals remain
VFR though a few show the stratus surging across the entire region.
Confidence was too low in that occuring, so kept the mention of
possible stratus to the KOAK and KSFO sites.

Vicinity of SFO...VFR conditions should prevail through the early
evening. Stratus is currently snaking up the Central and Bay Area
coasts. Guidance has this sticking to the west side of the San Mateo
and San Francisco coasts, which leads to higher confidence of VFR
conditions through at least the daylight hours. This evening and
overnight, things get a bit more tricky as most models have stratus
entering within 5-10 miles of the TAF site while others sock in SFO
completely. Opted to hint at the possibility of this with FEW-SCT015
from roughly 5Z-17Z Wed as confidence was low to medium in MVFR
stratus making it all the way to SFO. If the stratus does occur,
clearing might be closer to 17-19Z tomorrow morning.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...Stratus developed around the Monterey Bay
and has seeped into the central coast valleys this morning. MVFR to
IFR cigs look to hold through mid morning before gradually clearing.
A brief reprieve from the stratus is expected this afternoon, but
this will be short lived as MVFR to IFR stratus looks to make a
return later this evening.

.MARINE...
(Today through Sunday)
Issued at 844 AM PDT Tue May 6 2025

Moderate to fresh north to northwest winds linger across the outer
waters from Point Arena to Pigeon Point through tonight.
Elsewhere, winds continue to ease to a gentle to moderate breeze.
Seas continue to subside with significant wave heights dropping
below  10 feet through the forecast period. Northerly winds
strengthen late week with widespread fresh to strong gusts
expected through the end of the forecast period.

.MTR WATCHES/WARNINGS/ADVISORIES...
CA...None.
PZ...Small Craft Advisory until 3 AM PDT Wednesday for Pt Arena to Pt
     Reyes 10-60 NM.
