.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 320 AM PDT Mon Jul 10 2023

A look at nighttime microphysics satellite imagery shows another
night of patchy coastal stratus, extending inland over the Sonoma
County coastline, San Mateo county, and southern portion of Monterey
Bay. Elsewhere, skies are clear. Though, where stratus exists,
ceilings are generally lower than yesterday, with pilot reports
around the SF Bay region showing ceiling heights between 700 and 900
feet, and closer to 500 feet near Monterey Bay. As a result,
temperatures are running about two to three degrees warmer in areas
of low stratus as the clouds absorb radiational heat and re-emit it
towards the surface, helping to warm and insulate those localized
regions. That being said, temperatures are generally in the mid to
upper 50s.

Expect warming today with highs in the mid to upper 70s,
and closer to the low 80s for far interior locations. Despite high
temperatures expected to be about 5-10 degrees warmer than
yesterday, they will still be in the below normal range by about 2-3
degrees. Come Tuesday as warming continues, temperatures finally
reach seasonal normals, with mid 80s to low 90s expected for
interior locations such as North Bay Valleys, Santa Clara Valley,
Southern Monterey County, and East Bay Hills. Meanwhile, coastlines
and immediate bay shores to see upper 60s to low 70s. These
temperatures come as the influence of high pressure building over
the desert southwest begins to reach our area.

.LONG TERM...
(Tuesday through Sunday)
Issued at 320 AM PDT Mon Jul 10 2023

Looking beyond Tuesday and well into the weekend, high temperatures
are expected to steadily climb, culminating with the highest
temperatures on Sunday as of this writing. This is a change from the
previous forecast in which highest temperatures were expected
Saturday. However, a look at both deterministic model and ensemble
guidance shows the ridge of high pressure reaching its apex late
Sunday, with 500mb heights reaching the 600 dam mark. 850 mb temps
reach just shy of the 31 degrees Celsius mark around the same time.
According to KOAK sounding climatology, both of these values fall
well into the 90th percentile for their respective categories,
suggesting significant warming of the air mass. As such, have
increased Sunday max temperatures and overnight lows to reflect the
increased warming. Far interior locations look to reach the low 100s
(Fahrenheit, with immediate coastlines and bays in the 70s. As it
currently stands, far interior locations such as northern Sonoma
and Napa counties , Livermore, and far southern Monterey County
stand close to a 99% chance of exceeding 90 degrees on Sunday.
When looking at the chance of exceedance of 100 degrees for those
same areas, those chances move to 93%, 49%, and 87%, respectively.
All to say: prepare for some hot temperatures next weekend!

As temperatures climb, fuels will continue to cure and dry, leading
to increased fire start risk. Minimum relative humidities will be in
the teens to low 20th percentiles for interior locations and higher
elevations during peak heating, with recoveries only in the upper
20 percentile range. For lower elevations, recoveries to around
the upper 60 percentile range. Although not a widespread extreme
fire risk, it still pays to be careful, and don`t be the spark.
Avoid mowing or driving over dry grass and vegetation.

As a reminder before this upcoming heat event, lets revisit some
safety tips; If possible, try to keep outdoor activity to a minimum
between the hours of 10am and 6pm. If you must be outdoors, wear
loose-fitting and light colored clothing, take frequent breaks in
the shade, increase water intake and other hydrating beverages such
as sports drinks or those with electrolytes, and try to keep heart
rate and respiration low by minimizing physical activity. If you
don`t have access to air conditioning, utilize fans, misting
devices, and community cooling centers or pools to keep cool. If
heading to the coast or water to beat the heat, wear a lifevest,
swim near a lifeguard, and never turn your back on the ocean! Be
sure to Look Before You Lock and make sure no children or pets are
left in vehicles, as temperatures in vehicles can quickly rise to
become deadly in a matter of minutes. Check in on vulnerable
populations such as those without AC, the elderly,
immunocompromised, or young children. Stay safe, and Weather Aware!

That`s all for now. Stay tuned for more updates as the week goes on
and the warmup continues.
