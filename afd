...New SYNOPSIS, SHORT TERM, LONG TERM, AVIATION, MARINE...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 330 AM PDT Sat Jul 27 2024

Seasonal to below average temperatures continue through mid-week
before slightly above average temperatures return late week.

&&

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 330 AM PDT Sat Jul 27 2024

Widespread seasonal to below average temperatures continue.
Temperatures will drop between 5 to 10 degrees across the interior
today compared to yesterday as upper level troughing strengthens
over the Western US. High temperatures across the interior are
expected to be in the 70s to low 80s while highs closer to the coast
will be in the 60s to low 70s. Interior Monterey and San Benito
counties continue to be the hottest portions of our CWA with highs
in the mid 80s to low 90s expected today. The marine layer remains
fairly deep between 2000-2500 feet with satellite currently
observing widespread stratus over much of the Bay Area and Central
Coast. Ensemble guidance indicates moderate to high confidence in
today`s high temperature forecast but some uncertainty remains
depending on how fast stratus dissipates this morning. If stratus
dissipates more slowly than currently forecast, it may result in
areas where stratus persisted for a longer time period struggling to
reach their forecasted highs.

The HRRR and NBM both indicate that light drizzle is possible this
morning and again tonight for locations directly along the coast and
in areas where upslope ascent is favored. The most recent ECMWF runs
show fairly dry low level conditions at 850mb and 700mb. As such,
measurable precipitation beyond a trace to a few hundredths of an
inch is not expected. The NBM continues to indicate some potential
(20-40%) of scattered light showers over the marine environment
overnight.

.LONG TERM...
(Sunday through Friday)
Issued at 330 AM PDT Sat Jul 27 2024

Seasonal to below average temperatures will continue through mid-
week before trending seasonal to slightly above average by late next
week. Upper level troughing will deepen Saturday into Sunday before
the upper level low pressure system moves to the northeast and away
from the West Coast by late Sunday. The upper level flow will then
become more zonal (horizontal) by Monday, allowing for slight
warming to occur with temperatures expected to increase by a few
degrees each day from this point on. By mid-week, upper level
ridging will again start to build over the West Coast with ridging
and slightly above average temperatures to persist through the end
of the forecast period. High temperatures will generally remain in
the 70s to mid 80s on Sunday and Monday. Widespread highs in the low
to mid 80s are expected to return inland (reaching into the upper
80s to low 90s across favored hot spots) Tuesday and Wednesday. By
Thursday and Friday, high temperatures will reach the mid 80s to low
90s across the interior. For areas closer to the coast temperatures
will not vary quite as much with temperatures primarily staying in
the 60s directly along the coast and upper 60s to 70s slightly
inland from the coast.

Moderate uncertainty remains in the high temperature forecast from
Thursday onwards. Cluster guidance shows uncertainty in both where
the ridge will set up and how strong that ridge will be. Most of the
ensemble clusters favor the ridge setting up farther east of us but
at least one cluster centers the ridge more directly over the West
Coast. The strength and positioning of the ridge will impact how
much our high temperatures increase next week with both ECMWF and
GFS ensemble guidance showing a higher range of forecast highs from
Thursday onwards. CPC guidance continues to favor slightly above
average temperatures from Thursday onwards across our area which
increases forecast confidence that temperatures will be slightly
above average for the first week of August.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 330 AM PDT Sat Jul 27 2024

Deep marine layer developed overnight promoting widespread marine
stratus. MVFR/IFR cigs are expected to linger well into the morning
before mixing out and pulling back to the coast, where clouds are
expected throughout most of the day. Inland terminals such as the
North Bay and inland South and East bays will likely clear to VFR
through mid-to-late morning, while coastal and Bay Area terminals
may hold MVFR cigs through the period. Onshore wind pattern and
gusty gap flows persist today into this evening.

Vicinity of SFO...High confidence in MVFR/IFR cigs through this
morning with little chance of clearing through the afternoon. There
is about a 4-5 hour window beginning around 21Z where a slight
chance of SCT exists, but all guidance suggests cigs lingering
through the TAF period.

SFO Bridge Approach... Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...IFR cigs persist through the morning with
low confidence in clearing around midday to early afternoon.
Otherwise, high confidence in MVFR/IFR cigs returning later this
afternoon and persisting into Sunday morning with some patchy DZ
overnight.

&&

.MARINE...
(Today through Thursday)
Issued at 330 AM PDT Sat Jul 27 2024

Moderate to breezy Northwest winds linger through the weekend
before diminishing by early next week. Expect some strong gusts
in the northern outer waters as well as along the Big Sur Coast
through this afternoon. Significant wave heights will continue to
abate through the weekend.

&&

.MTR WATCHES/WARNINGS/ADVISORIES...
CA...None.
PZ...Small Craft Advisory until 9 AM PDT this morning for SF Bay N of
     Bay Bridge.

     Small Craft Advisory from 3 PM this afternoon to 9 PM PDT this
     evening for Pt Pinos to Pt Piedras Blancas 0-10 nm.

     Small Craft Advisory until 9 AM PDT Sunday for Pt Arena to Pt
     Reyes 10-60 NM.
