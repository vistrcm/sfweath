...New UPDATE...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 105 AM PST Thu Mar 7 2024

High pressure brings quieter weather over the next few days. An
unsettled pattern returns for this weekend into early next week
with light rain chances, especially from the Golden Gate
north. A drier pattern looks to establish towards mid month.

.UPDATE...
Issued at 833 AM PST Thu Mar 7 2024

What a difference 24 hour makes...yesterday we had a low pressure
lurking off the coast generating showers and today the low
pressure is well south with low clouds/breezy north winds in its
wake. While generally drier conditions prevail this morning, there
have been reports of drizzle given the low clouds and ample low
level moisture.

No update needed this morning. As noted below, do expect the low
clouds to gradually clear by this afternoon leading to more
sunshine today. Good news as the sun will help dry things out from
yesterday`s flooding.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 105 AM PST Thu Mar 7 2024

Troughing departs to our east as high pressure begins building in
from the eastern Pacific. A decent low-level pressure gradient
will promote breezy northerly winds especially over the local
waters and along the coastal interface. Skies will clear from
north to south with plenty of sun for most of the area this
afternoon. Temperatures will remain a little cool, with highs
ranging from the upper 50s along the coast to the lower 60s within
the interior valleys. Winds will begin easing tonight with lows
dipping into the upper 30s and lower 40s. A few of the coldest
locations in southern Monterey and San Benito Counties may briefly
dip into the mid 30s right before sunrise.

&&

.LONG TERM...
(Friday through Wednesday)
Issued at 105 AM PST Thu Mar 7 2024

High pressure will remain prominent across the region on Friday
with plentiful sunshine, lighter winds, and slightly warmer
temperatures. Look for highs to reach the mid to upper 60s away
from the immediate coast with lows mostly in the 40s.

An upper troughing pattern resumes for Saturday into early next
week. An initial upper wave will only bring a glancing blow to the
region with some light rain possible for the North Bay. Rain chances
then increase by early next week for much of the Bay Area and
northern portions of the Central Coast. Rain amount still appear
generally light with the greatest accumulations over the North Bay
during this time.

High pressure should bring quiet weather and warmer temperatures for
late week into next weekend and the 8-14 day Climate Prediction
Center outlook suggests drier conditions should prevail.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 335 AM PST Thu Mar 7 2024

MVFR ceilings in low stratus this morning for most of the
terminals with visibility restrictions in FG at KSTS. We should
remain socked in through the early to mid morning hours before
clearing commences. There is a range of model solutions regarding
clearing time, with some suggesting it will be earlier (15-16Z),
while others keep low clouds around until 19Z or later. Opted for
a middle of the road approach (~18Z) for most locations, but be
aware there is somewhat lower confidence in clearing at "exactly"
this time. Once we get the clouds out of here the remaining TAF
is VFR with breezy onshore winds this afternoon.

Vicinity of SFO...MVFR stratus at the terminal this morning and
the current TAF will keep this in place through 18Z. There are
some model solutions which scatter CIGS out earlier (15-16Z) but
with low confidence in timing nominally aimed for 18Z for now.
Once we get the clouds out of here expect VFR for the remainder of
the TAF period. Light winds this morning will become breezy and
onshore this afternoon and evening with gusts to around 25 kt.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...MVFR stratus at the terminals this
morning and the current TAF will keep this in place through 18Z.
VFR for the remainder of the TAF period once the low clouds mix
out. Light winds this morning become breezy and onshore this
afternoon.

.MARINE...
(Today through Tuesday)
Issued at 335 AM PST Thu Mar 7 2024

Post-frontal fresh to strong northerly breezes are expected today
with building rough seas. Seas will briefly abate on Friday
before rebuilding this weekend. Rain chances return to the
northern waters on Saturday and for the remainder of the area by
early next week.
