...New AVIATION, MARINE...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 1232 AM PST Sun Dec 29 2024

Rain and gusty winds today as a cold front ushers in a new, dry
air mass. Clear skies will yield plenty of sunshine and cold
morning temperatures this week.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 1232 AM PST Sun Dec 29 2024

Key Messages for the Short Term:
-Moderate to heavy rainfall across the North Bay this morning
-Largely light to moderate rain elsewhere on Sunday
-Elevated wind gusts of 30 to 40 mph, isolated to 50 in North Bay

The rain is just now entering the KMUX field of view and should
reach Santa Rosa by 4-6 AM and San Francisco by 6-8 AM. This cold
front still looks to be fast moving. This means the rain rates
will be high at times, but the limited duration will help
alleviate widespread flooding concerns in the waterways. The more
likely impact is urban flooding, shallow landslides, and downed
trees due to the antecedent saturation, high rain rates, and
strong, shifting wind gusts as the front moves through. Total
rainfall today is expected to be between 0.5-1.5" in the North Bay
and between 0.25 and 0.5" through the rest of the Bay Area. The
Central Coast will be drier and less windy as the cold front loses
steam, but we`re still expecting up to 1/4" in the early
afternoon. In addition to rain, the cold front will bring a sharp
shift in the wind direction from southerly to northerly. By the
afternoon/early evening, the sun will make a triumphant return as
the new, dry air mass settles in.

.LONG TERM...
(Monday through Saturday)
Issued at 1232 AM PST Sun Dec 29 2024

Key Messages for the Long Term:
-Frost and freeze conditions expected Mon-Thu mornings

Building high pressure behind the front will bring much more
benign conditions next week. The only real concern is cold morning
temperatures. Otherwise it will be a glorious week with plenty of
sunshine and high temps in the mid 50s to lower 60s. The long
nights, clear skies, and dry air mass will encourage enhanced
radiational cooling. The actual air mass isn`t terribly cold, with
850 temps somewhere between the 25th and 50th percentile for this
time of year. This means a nocturnal inversion will set up, cold
dense air will sink, and the valleys will be colder than the
mountains. The temperature change will be noticeable in a "grab
your heavier jacket before walking the dog" type of way. Monday
morning is expected to be 10-15 degrees colder than Sunday
morning. As the winds weaken, Tuesday will be even colder, with
most lowlands expecting the coldest day of the season. Santa Rosa
could even drop into the upper 20s. Since this is driven by
radiational cooling in the shallow boundary layer, the forecast is
challenging. Any wind will mix down warmer air and the exact min
temp is hard to pin down. I used a blend of 1/3 deterministic NBM
and 2/3 NBM ensemble mean for min temp. The ensemble mean is much
cooler than the deterministic. In many locations the deterministic
NBM is well above the ensemble box and whisker plots warmest
whisker (top 10%). Raw model output is also warmer than the NBM,
and you may see some large minimum temperature discrepancy
between different weather apps this week. Our forecast confidence
is pretty low as a result, and I`m a little concerned that the
heavy bias correction is based on a much different weather pattern
over the last month. Up until now December has been 2-5 degrees
above normal. As more higher resolution models start to "see"
Monday and Tuesday, we will get a clearer picture of how cold it
will actually get this week.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 357 AM PST Sun Dec 29 2024

VFR-MVFR deteriorating to more widespread MVFR-IFR, gusty winds
and moderate to heavy rain with a cold frontal passage in the Bay
Area this morning. Lowering ceilings, visibilities, moderate rain
with the cold front will also reach the north Central Coast by
late morning and afternoon. Winds strongest near and along frontal
passage, instability (and shear) increasing too; will closely
monitor KMUX radar, satellite, observations and amend TAFs as
needed.

Post frontal clearing takes place though with lingering surface based
instability there may be a few additional showers developing in the
afternoon. Clearing and less wind tonight, with light cold air drainage
winds developing in the valleys overnight into Monday morning. After
a quick soaking rain with frontal passage today, will need to watch
for fog development (or frost where wind is calm) under clearing,
radiative cooling and light winds tonight and Monday morning.

Vicinity of SFO...VFR, south to southeast wind increasing at SFO while
a cold front is approaching the terminal from the northwest. Wind becoming
strong and gusty near and during cold frontal passage mid to late this
morning. Wind shifting to westerly by 20z today. Vicinity showers and
gusty west wind in the afternoon, wind easing by late afternoon. VFR
in dry weather tonight and Monday morning.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...VFR, south to southeast winds increasing with
light to moderate rain arriving prior to cold frontal passage early
in the afternoon. Rain may also be briefly heavy during frontal passage
with conditions deteriorating to MVFR-IFR. Conditions improving to VFR
by late afternoon, with a few additional passing showers possible. VFR
and light cold air drainage winds tonight and Monday morning. Will have
to watch for patchy fog development as well tonight and Monday morning.

.MARINE...
Issued at 325 AM PST Sun Dec 29 2024

A cold front with gusty winds and rain will move southeastward across
the coastal waters and bays today. A few post frontal showers develop
in the afternoon otherwise dry weather returns tonight. Long to moderate
period swell will continue to run through the waters through
midweek.
