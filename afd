...New AVIATION...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 240 AM PDT Wed May 24 2023

Night and morning clouds will persist before giving way to mostly
sunny afternoons through the remainder of the week in response to
an upper level trough over the West Coast. As such, temperatures
will largely be slightly below seasonal averages through late
week.

&&

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 240 AM PDT Wed May 24 2023

A broad mid/upper level trough remains positioned over the West
Coast with the core of the low pressure system over eastern
Oregon. Closer to the surface, widespread stratus has developed
early this morning with coverage still expanding inland at this
hour. Similar to yesterday, do expect these clouds to dissipate
and retreat to the coast by early afternoon. The exception will be
around the Monterey Bay region where low clouds are likely to
linger through the day. Thus, temperatures near the coast will
only warm into the upper 50s to lower 60s with low/mid 70s well
inland. With little change in the broader pattern, expect stratus
to spread inland once again tonight into early Thursday morning.

&&

.LONG TERM...
(Thursday through Tuesday)
Issued at 240 AM PDT Wed May 24 2023

Both deterministic and ensemble guidance are in good agreement
with respect to the broad trough lingering over the West Coast
through at least Friday. This pattern will result in only subtle
day-to-day changes with temperatures on the cooler side of
seasonal averages and periods of night/morning low clouds followed
by mostly sunny afternoon conditions. By the upcoming holiday
weekend, the aforementioned trough will shift slightly inland with
a weak short-wave ridge developing in its wake. Thus, interior
areas are expected to warm by a few degrees through the upcoming
weekend.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 440 AM PDT Wed May 24 2023

Satellite shows stratus funneling into the region over all
terminals. The profiler for the Bodega Bay and Fort Ord shows a
deepen marine layer. Therefore, a mix of VFR/MVFR/IFR cigs extend
over the terminals. Wind show an onshore flow with moderate to
breezy winds for most terminals except for KSTS. High confidence
that ceilings will start to improve to VFR near 17-20Z. Moderate
confidence on timing of when MVFR ceilings will return but expect
all terminals to experience a return of stratus late
tonight/midnight. Winds will remain onshore through the TAF period
and winds will become light to moderate late tonight into early
tomorrow morning.

Vicinity of SFO...MVFR conditions as stratus continues to build over
the SF Bay. Moderate confidence on timing of clearing but expect
improvements to VFR near 17Z. Winds will remain S/SW and moderate to
breezy. Expect MVFR conditions to return tonight and sticking around
through until early tomorrow morning.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...MVFR conditions will be widespread but
moderate confidence that conditions will improve to VFR near 18Z.
Otherwise, expect MVFR to return tonight. Moderate confidence that
winds will become gusty but expect gusty winds up to 23 knots.

.MARINE...
(Today through Monday)
Issued at 240 AM PDT Wed May 24 2023

Breezy to gusty northwest winds continue with gale force gusts
lasting for the northern outer waters through this afternoon. As
such, expect steep wind waves resulting hazardous conditions for
small craft. A new southerly swell at 18 to 20 seconds arrives
Wednesday morning. Winds gradually diminish late this week as an
upper level trough persists over the West Coast.

.MTR WATCHES/WARNINGS/ADVISORIES...

PZ...Small Craft Advisory from 3 PM this afternoon to 3 AM PDT
     Thursday for PZZ530.

     Small Craft Advisory until 9 AM PDT this morning for PZZ540-575.
