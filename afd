.SYNOPSIS...

Warm and dry conditions persist through at least the first week of
December.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 241 AM PST Sun Dec 1 2024

Building high pressure across the West Coast and an upper-level low
off the California Coast remains the name of the game. The upper-
level low is responsible for the returns visible on KMUX trekking
northwards out of San Luis Obispo County. At first glance the
radar may look impressive, but surface dew point depressions
quickly negate that. For what it`s worth, locations to the south
have not even recorded any measurable rainfall. If anything,
expect virga and a colorful sunrise. Aside from that, the first
day of December and meteorological winter will feel anything but
with temperatures up to 15 degrees above average as high pressure
continues to build into place. For you climate buffs, while
Monterey Airport is not yet a climate site due to it being too
young (less than 30 years old), it did break a record for daily
maximum temperature on November 30th by reaching 70 degrees,
breaking the previous record of 69 degrees set in 2008 and again
in 2021.

.LONG TERM...

Issued at 241 AM PST Sun Dec 1 2024
