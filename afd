...New AVIATION, MARINE...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 108 AM PDT Thu May 1 2025

Fairly standard weather continues through Friday with warm inland
temperatures and cooler, cloudy weather in the marine layer. A
disturbance will bring strong winds and cooler temperatures
Saturday.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 108 AM PDT Thu May 1 2025

The enhanced IR satellite view shows extensive marine layer
stratus across the Bay Area and Central Coast. Interestingly the
stratus is filling the Salinas Valley all the way to Paso Robles,
while further north it`s hardly reaching the East Bay. This
suggests the marine layer depth is not uniform. The Ft. Ord
profiler reveals a depth of 2,500 feet in Monterey County,
compared to 1,000-1,500 feet near the San Francisco Bay according
to the PGE-WRF. This depth difference is caused by a weak
disturbance in the 500 mb ridge over Southern California, while
the ridge axis moves over Northern California. Basically there is
less air pushing down on the marine layer over the Central Coast
compared to the Bay Area, which is allowing the marine layer to
expand deeper with decreasing latitude. The pattern is pretty slow
to evolve through the day, and this trend will likely hold.
Inland and higher elevation areas will have another nice day in
the mid 70s with plenty of sunshine. There is a slight chance of
convection, mainly east and south of the Bay Area, though SPC has
placed southern Monterey and San Benito counties in a general
thunder risk today. With cold air aloft there is good instability
this afternoon (HRRR shows 1000 J/kg of CAPE at Paso Robles), but
it`s elevated above some moderate inhibition, and the CAMs don`t
show any activity developing.

.LONG TERM...
(Friday through Wednesday)
Issued at 108 AM PDT Thu May 1 2025

By Friday a long wave trough will begin to approach the coast.
This system has been slowing down in recent model runs, which
should allow the relatively good weather to continue through
Friday before the cold front brings overcast skies Friday night.
Any rain associated with this system should be very light as the
PWAT only reaches around 0.8" and the moisture plume is pretty
narrow and fast moving ahead of the surface front. By the time the
sun comes up on Saturday, the front may have already passed
allowing the skies to gradually clear through the day as much
drier air filters in. By far the biggest impact will be strong NW
winds in the post-frontal environment. Subtropical high pressure
will build over the Eastern Pacific while the surface low
associated with the cold front moves N-S across Eastern
California. The gradient between these two features will support
wind speeds of 15-30 mph with gusts as high as 35-50 mph. The
strongest winds will be along the coast Saturday afternoon. Strong
winds will persist Sunday as the low bottoms out around 1004 mb
near Las Vegas Sunday morning. Despite the wind, the skies will be
clear and temperatures will start to rebound. Improvement
continues into next week with offshore winds possible Monday and
a new ridge becoming established mid-week. Temperatures will
return to a nice seasonal normal and the marine layer may even
take a few days off to give coastal areas some sunshine.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 417 AM PDT Thu May 1 2025

Currently a mixed bag of VFR-IFR at the terminals. A relatively
deep marine layer of 2,300 feet has been allowed to penetrate
inland bringing IFR/MVFR ceilings to all terminals except SFO so
far, but that luck will run out shortly as stratus is converging
on the terminal. VFR is expected by this afternoon at all
terminals but HAF. The pattern will remain relatively unchanged
through the TAF period as the region remains under a mini Rex
block. Moderate onshore winds will prevail through the TAF period.

Vicinity of SFO...Currently VFR with northerly flow. The terminal
is expected to deteriorate to MVFR as stratus continues to close
in on the terminal. VFR and moderate westerly winds will prevail
by this afternoon.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...Currently IFR with southwesterly flow at
MRY and IFR with westerly flow at SNS. VFR is expected by this
afternoon with clouds lingering at the coast. IFR conditions
return again this evening.

.MARINE...
(Today through Tuesday)
Issued at 417 AM PDT Thu May 1 2025

Moderate to strong northwesterly breezes and moderate seas will
prevail through Friday. Widespread hazardous marine conditions
are expected over the weekend and into early next week in the form
of gale-force northerly winds with up to storm-force gusts
possible. Rough to very rough seas are also forecast for the
weekend.
