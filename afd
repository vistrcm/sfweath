.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 1253 PM PST Sun Jan 5 2025

The dry pattern continues with periods of strong offshore winds
and hazardous beach conditions this week.

&&

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 328 AM PST Mon Jan 6 2025

Patchy dense fog has begun to develop across the North Bay, south
into coastal portions of the Bay Area and East Bay. A dense fog
advisory is now in effect until 10 AM across much of the North Bay.
Currently, US 101 between Healdsburg and San Rafael are most
impacted by visibilities of 1/4mi or less. Locations seeing dense
fog this morning will eventually join the rest of our area in
another beautiful day across our area with similar temperatures as
yesterday. Gusty winds out of the north will develop late tonight at
elevations above 1000ft. A weak surface pressure gradient across our
area will help prevent the higher winds from mixing to lower lying
areas until late Tuesday morning, when the most energetic portion of
the `inside slider` sweeps through our area north to south and
provides additional forcing. Winds will remain elevated behind the
system as it barrels through SoCal, as an impressive large scale
gradient develops between SFO and WMC in northern Nevada (-12 to -
14mb). The surface high pressure over northern Nevada will result in
moderate downsloping winds and warmer temperatures funneling across
our region. We have decided to forego a Wind Advisory at this time.
There is less than a 10% chance of wind gusts exceeding 40 MPH for
locations lower than 1000ft through the entirety of the event, and
not expected tonight.

.LONG TERM...
(Tuesday through Sunday)
Issued at 328 AM PST Mon Jan 6 2025

Tuesday and Wednesday will be breezy as mentioned above, with an
active San Francisco/Winnemucca gradient driving persistent
downsloping flow across our region. The Diablo winds will shut down
quickly Wednesday evening once the height isopleths are more in line
with one another and vertical forcing to the surface eases. Thursday
will be another banner day across our forecast area with near record
daily highs for some locations, little to now wind and plenty of
sunshine. Pleasant weather through the remainder of the extended and
warmer than normal temperatures, with deterministic guidance hinting
at the potential for another `inside slider` possible for the
beginning of next week.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 328 AM PST Mon Jan 6 2025

Persistent FG this morning invof North Bay terminals, occasionally
affecting Bay Area terminals through sunrise today. Ceilings will
return to VFR by this afternoon. Winds stay mostly light and
occasionally variable through most of the TAF period, eventually
becoming more northerly by the end of the period Tuesday morning.
Gusty offshore (N/NE) winds are expected Tuesday morning.

Vicinity of SFO...Dense FG around the northern SF Bay expected to
linger through sunrise this morning before clearing to VFR this
afternoon. Winds become gusty and N/NE by the end of the TAF
period as a moderate offshore-oriented pressure gradient sets up.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...VFR through Monday with relatively light
winds. Slight chance of reductions in vis and cigs early Tuesday
morning, but a low confidence scenario.

&&

.MARINE...
(Today through Saturday)
Issued at 328 AM PST Mon Jan 6 2025

Northwesterly swell will gradually build through the day today
with gusty northwest winds resulting in hazardous conditions for
small craft later this afternoon through early Wednesday morning.
Expect wave heights from 11-15ft.

&&

.BEACHES...
Issued at 948 AM PST Sun Jan 5 2025

Long period WNW swell will arrive Monday morning. The swell period
will be between 16 and 20 seconds, with a height of 6 to 9 feet.
This translates to breaking waves up to 20 feet mathematically,
but the bigger threat is from sneaker waves and rip currents.
Depending on the bathymetry, low-moderate height long period swell
is actually less likely to break at all, but has the potential to
generate sneaker waves with tremendous beach run-up. These act
similar to a tsunami surge. Sneaker wave physics is complex, and
not fully understood, but the main ingredient is long period
swell. The threat is also enhanced with light local winds, which
we will have Monday. The threat is also enhanced with a rising
tide. Fortunately, we are in a 1st quarter moon tomorrow, with
less impactful neap tides. We can`t guarantee that sneaker waves
will be observed, but the chances are much higher than normal and
strong currents are expected. Maintain a larger buffer from the
water`s edge, and never turn your back on the ocean!
