Cool temperatures persist through the Labor Day Holiday. A warmup

.UPDATE...
Issued at 822 AM PDT Fri Aug 30 2024

The stratus deck expanded throughout the lower elevations
overnight, save parts of the interior East Bay and the Napa
Valley. The latest images show the stratus beginning to mix out
towards the edges, a process that should continue throughout the
morning as stratus retreats to the immediate coast. The forecast
remains on track with no changes at this time.

As I sit here and type up this AFD,
temperatures across the region are largely in the low 60s and upper
50s, around 2-4 degrees cooler than this same time yesterday.
Meanwhile, the Ft. Ord profiler is showing the marine layer just shy
of 2000` deep, and coastal stratus can be seen far down the Salinas
Valley, just mere miles from reaching the shared Monterey and SLO
county border. Further north, the stratus is enveloping the majority
of Marin county, and is cruising up the coastal valleys in Sonoma
county. So what is all this attributed to? Low pressure! An upper
level trough traversing the region is to thank for these cooler
temperatures and pleasant weather. A welcome relief after what feels
like a very warm summer.

Today expect the pleasant weather to continue with high
temperatures running close to average for this time of year, with
highs in the upper 80s and low 90s generally across the interior.
Meanwhile at the coastline, its all about the 60s. Typical
afternoon seabreeze returns in the latter portion of the day
today, bringing breezy conditions and some gusts through the
Golden Gate gap region and the Delta.

The troughing continues through the weekend and Labor Day
with below-normal temperatures expected. However, Monday, Labor Day,
will see just a slight uptick in high temperatures as ridging (high
pressure) redevelops over the region, leading us into our next
period of warm weather. But, for the sake of Labor Day activity
planning, lets provide a quick rundown of what you can expect
weather-wise for the day:

-Interior regions will see highs in the upper 80s and low 90s.
Here`s a sample of highs expected for a handful of cities on Monday:
Concord 88, Livermore 86, SF downtown 73, SF Ocean Beach 62, Santa
Rosa 84, Napa 82, Gilroy 90, Monterey 69, Santa Cruz downtown 79,
King City 88.

-Clear skies, minus some overcast conditions in the morning at the
immediate coast until the stratus clears in the afternoon.

-Light onshore winds in the afternoon, with breezier conditions near
coastal gaps as the seabreeze picks up in the afternoon.

All in all, it should be a pleasant day for anyone that is perhaps
planning any activities outdoors for the holidays. Being one of
the last big summer holidays where temperatures are still warm
outside, many people may be planning to hit the water. As always,
we want to encourage people to be safe, so if you`re planning on
going boating or swimming at the lake, or even just having a BBQ
on the shore, remember to wear that life jacket, know the risks
of cold water shock, swim near a lifeguard, and check local ocean
or waterway conditions before you go.

Beyond the holiday, warm temperatures persist, with the ridge
building Tuesday and beyond to allow for the return of above normal
temperatures. At this point, no products have been issued for heat.
All for now.
