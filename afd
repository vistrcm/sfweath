.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 233 AM PDT Sun Oct 6 2024

If you`ve ever seen the movie "Groundhog Day", you`ll understand
what these last few night shifts have felt like. Currently seeing
some weak returns on the radar, which are elevated showers
associated with some lingering subtropical moisture above 10,000
feet. Once again, none of this is expected to make it to the
ground as the air below is still very dry. One notable change to
the short term forecast this morning are today`s forecast highs.
We have bumped them up just a touch given that we are starting the
day slightly warmer than we did yesterday. The issue with today is
that there is the potential for a southerly marine surge to impact
coastal areas, which would greatly limit the upper end of the
high temps. This makes for a very difficult forecast for areas
like Santa Cruz, the Peninsula coast, and San Francisco. Should
the southerly surge make it into the Ocean Beach/Sunset District
today, we could potentially be looking at a situation where there
is as much as a 25 degree temperature difference from one side of
San Francisco to the other. Regardless of what happens along the
coast, we will still be dealing with impactful heat elsewhere with
widespread moderate-to-major HeatRisk and high temperatures right
around what they were yesterday.

.LONG TERM...
(Monday through Saturday)
Issued at 233 AM PDT Sun Oct 6 2024

Through the rest of this week, expect temperatures to be on the
downward trend starting Monday. We aren`t going to see a sharp
drop off the cliff, but a steady decline into mid week. Ensemble
guidance is depicting reasonably high confidence in a cooler
pattern through this week, which is very welcome news after the
week we`ve had. In terms of overall risk, there is still some risk
for impacts from warm temperatures on Monday as highs will still
be ranging from the lower-to-upper 90s inland and mid-60s to 80
along the coast. However, Monday would fall into the category of a
"moderate" heat scenario under the HeatRisk category, decreasing
from the extreme and major that we have had over the past seven
days. There will be lingering impacts, but those should start to
wane even more by Tuesday and Wednesday when we will see minor or
even little-to-no HeatRisk across the region. By the end of the
week, we have moderate confidence that high temps will be in the
80s inland and the 60s along the coast once again. For Saturday,
there is a decent plume of moisture associated with the trough
that could actually result in some measurable precip for the
northern zones. It may only be in the form of drizzle, but there
are a very select few ensemble members holding on the the chance
of a light rain event for the North Bay on Saturday. Very slim
chance, but we will certainly welcome the cooler temperatures and
even drizzle if we can get it.
