...New UPDATE, MARINE...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 239 AM PDT Thu Sep 19 2024

There is a slight chance of showers and even a couple rumbles of
thunder over southern Monterey County later this afternoon and
early evening, with the best chances farther inland you go into
higher elevations. Locations under the influence of the marine
layer along the coast will be in the 60s and low 70s. Interior
locations away from the marine layer will be in the 70s to low
80s. A warming trend for this weekend into the beginning of next
week remains on track.

&&

.UPDATE...
Issued at 907 AM PDT Thu Sep 19 2024

Showers and thunderstorms occurred and continue over the interior
Central Coast with rainfall amounts of 0.36" near Greenfield and
0.47" at Mustang Ridge in the past 12 hours. Those are just sites
that happened to be under the rainfall and up to 0.75" may have
occurred in areas without rain gauges. There remains the potential
for additional showers and thunderstorms through the afternoon
across this region, but current radar trends show this ongoing
convection diminishing. That said, the ongoing forecast remains on
track with no updates anticipated this morning.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 239 AM PDT Thu Sep 19 2024

A positively tilted upper level low currently situated offshore in
the vicinity of Big Sur will continue to track south along the
California coastline toward Los Angeles today and eventually begin
to move inland over San Diego by tomorrow afternoon and evening. The
best chance for showers and/or thunderstorms will be farther inland
where orographic upslope flow enhances an otherwise weak
thermodynamic environment for convection. Highs today will
generally be 5-10 degrees below normal, and slightly warmer
tomorrow.

&&

.LONG TERM...
(Friday through Wednesday)
Issued at 239 AM PDT Thu Sep 19 2024

The upper level trough moving across our area today and tomorrow
will eventually shift inland over SOCAL by tomorrow evening.
Increasing H50 heights and thickness values over the weekend will
result in temperatures rebounding back up above normal by the end of
the weekend into the beginning of next week. A weak upper level
disturbance interrupts the ridging pattern off the coast of central
California by late Sunday into early Monday morning, while the
northern extent of the ridging amplifies over the Pacific Northwest.
The net result is warmer than normal temperatures and increasing
heat risk concerns the farther inland and north you go for the
beginning of next week. The warming trend may result in the need for
a heat advisory for those locations as soon as Sunday, but more
likely Monday and Tuesday.
