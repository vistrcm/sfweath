.UPDATE...
Issued at 914 AM PDT Tue Apr 1 2025

Showers continue across the Bay Area and Central Coast this
morning, and already one of the cells has been strong enough to
trigger an Special Weather Statement. Expect thunderstorm activity
to ramp up later this morning and this afternoon, before shower
activity diminishes this evening. The operations staff will
continue to monitor showers and potential thunderstorms through
the day.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 232 AM PDT Tue Apr 1 2025

It is time to test out that April showers bring May flowers
expression. Post-frontal rain showers will continue through the day
as the parent low pressure system with upper-level support treks
southeastward from Northwestern California. Rainfall totals up to
0.75" can be expected; however, they will be heavily dependent on
where rain showers (or thunderstorms!) develop. Widespread wind
gusts of 20-30 mph, gusts up to 45 mph in the higher terrain and
along the immediate coast are also expected. Isolated to scattered
thunderstorms will be possible across the region through this
evening. The necessary ingredients that we have are: a surface
trough, conditionally unstable lapse rates, and remnant moisture. If
a thunderstorm were to develop, the primary hazards will be
lightning, locally heavy rainfall and gusty winds, and small hail.
As the sun sets so too will the thunderstorm chances as daytime
heating is lost.

.LONG TERM...
(Wednesday through Monday)
Issued at 232 AM PDT Tue Apr 1 2025

Tomorrow will kick off the warming and drying trend that is expected
through Sunday as the surface low pressure ejects into the Southern
Great Basin and high pressure begins to build in its wake. The
return of above normal temperatures and minor HeatRisk are slated
for Friday and linger through Monday. Cold conditions can be
expected during the overnight periods, particularly in the higher
terrain, as clear skies and light winds will help to maximize
radiational cooling. A cold front will skirt the region Sunday into
Monday bringing with it light precipitation. Rainfall totals will be
dependent on terrain with the help of orographic lift with a few
hundredths expected in the higher terrain of the Bay Area and up to
0.25" in extreme northwestern Sonoma County.|

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 443 AM PDT Tue Apr 1 2025

Scattered showers are increasing in coverage and intensity this
morning. That trend will continue into the afternoon before some
drier air settles in this evening. Ceilings should remain VFR, but
brief downpours in strong showers could temporarily reduce the
visibility below 3 miles. There is also a 20-30 percent chance
for thunderstorms beginning in the late morning and lasting
through the afternoon. Finally, strong westerly winds will persist
through the afternoon and early evening before diminishing
overnight. As high pressure builds on Wednesday, the skies will
clear and winds ease.

Vicinity of SFO...Scattered showers will persist through the
afternoon, with a chance for thunderstorms around mid-day. Strong
westerly winds are already ongoing at OAK, and should develop at
SFO shortly. While strong, the wind direction will stay much more
consistent today than we`ve seen over the last couple days.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...Showers are pushing through and will
continue through the afternoon. Moderate to strong WNW winds will
also persist through the afternoon before conditions improve this
evening.

&&

.MARINE...
(Today through Sunday)
Issued at 914 AM PDT Tue Apr 1 2025

Isolated to scattered showers will continue to pass over the
waters today before tapering off later this evening. There remains
a possibility for an isolated thunderstorm or two as well, though
confidence remains lower on this. Otherwise, a strong NW breeze
will persist through Wednesday. A high W-NW swell generated from
a gale force low off the coast of Oregon is propagating across the
coastal waters. Very rough combined seas are expected today and
will peak at around 14 feet before subsiding Wednesday.
