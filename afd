...New UPDATE, MARINE...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 204 AM PDT Wed May 14 2025

Departing trough and upstream ridging promote fair weather and a
warming trend through the rest of the week. Slight cool off into
the weekend as another upper level trough moves through. Better
signal for gusty conditions and potential offshore winds early
next week.

.UPDATE...
Issued at 825 AM PDT Wed May 14 2025

Stratus lingers along the coast south of Point Reyes and extends
inland across the Monterey Bay region, down the Salinas Valley,
and into the Morgan Hill-Gilroy-Hollister area. The stratus is
expected to continue mixing out through the morning, with
generally fair weather today. No changes to the forecast.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 204 AM PDT Wed May 14 2025

Northwest flow and drier air aloft will restore fair weather
conditions across the region today, paving the way for a warming
trend through this week. High temperatures around seasonal normals
today with mostly clear skies. Some cloud cover will likely
encroach upon the North Bay later this afternoon as some leftover
moisture from decaying convection advects into the northern
portion of the state. CAMs also advertising some fair weather CU
across the Gabilan Range again, but limited-to-no instability and
decreasing moisture will greatly limit any further vertical
development.

.LONG TERM...
(Thursday through Tuesday)
Issued at 204 AM PDT Wed May 14 2025

Despite a quiet mid-week period, a rather active pattern persists
into this weekend and early next week. A deep upper low is progged
to move out of the Gulf of Alaska region into the Western US by
the weekend, closely resembling a pattern that would result in
offshore winds across the North Bay and Central Coast. However,
current guidance depicts this feature taking a bit more of a
western trajectory compared to a typically "inside slider", so we
don`t see the signal for widespread impactful offshore winds as of
this issuance. However, ensemble guidance does advertise high
confidence in this pattern resulting in gusty surface conditions
across the region, especially Saturday and Sunday. Stay tuned for
forecast updates and any necessary information regarding the
potential for elevated fire danger this weekend.
