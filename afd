...New UPDATE...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 121 AM PDT Fri Mar 22 2024

Look for unsettled weather for Friday into the weekend with breezy
winds, rain showers, and even a few thunderstorms. Drier
conditions by early next week with rain chances returning for mid
to late week.

.UPDATE...
Issued at 837 AM PDT Fri Mar 22 2024

A system lurking off the coast is already making its presence
known this morning with a few scattered showers in the North
Bay. While current KMUX radar is "over shooting" the precip
automated sensors are picking up light rain around Santa Rosa.
That being said, KMUX radar imagery is picking up more widespread
shower activity off the North Bay coast. These showers are on
track to move inland later today as a cold front moves inland.
Biggest impact today will be the timing of said rainfall. Latest
guidance has trended slower with onset of precip, which now puts
precip impacting SF Bay during the afternoon/evening rush hour.

No update needed this morning as current forecast is ontrack, but
will be closely monitor precip moving inland.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 121 AM PDT Fri Mar 22 2024

A vertically stacked low pressure system around 450 nm west of
Eureka will slowly progress northeast and locate off the SW Oregon
coast by this evening as the surface low deepens. An associated cold
frontal zone will sweep through the region from northwest to
southeast today with a band of showers accompanying it. Rain chances
will first increase across the North Bay during the late morning to
early afternoon hours, then across SF during the mid afternoon
hours, before reaching the Central Coast during the late afternoon
and evening. Breezy SW winds will precede the frontal passage
with low elevation gusts of 25-30 mph and ridgetop gusts topping
out around 45 mph. In general rain amounts with today`s frontal
passage will range around around 0.75-1" for the North Bay Coastal
Ranges and Santa Cruz Mountains, to 0.5" or less for the Bay
Area, to around 0.25" or less for the Central Coast. Impacts from
wind and rain today should be overall minor, but can`t rule out
some localized ponding of water on roadways or a tree down here or
there. After an evening lull scattered showers look to return
overnight as cooling temperatures aloft/steepening lapse rates
combine with a secondary surface trough approaching the region.
Isolated thunderstorms are possible (10-15% chance) with lightning
and brief heavy rainfall as the primary hazards. While additional
overnight rain amounts should be light overall, can`t rule out
localized higher totals for areas impacted by a heavier shower or
storm. High temperatures will range from around 60 in the North
Bay to the mid-upper 60s for inland portions of the Central Coast.
Lows tonight will dip into the 40s, with some 30s in the higher
terrain.

.LONG TERM...
(Saturday through Thursday)
Issued at 121 AM PDT Fri Mar 22 2024

Saturday through Sunday:

The aforementioned upper low will drop southeast towards the
western CA/OR border by evening as the surface low gradually fills.
A surface trough will remain in the vicinity of coastal northern and
central California during this time. Instability will be on the
increase during the daytime hours given the combination of steep
mid/upper level lapse rates and insolation. With the surface trough
providing a continued source of forcing for ascent expect scattered
showers to be ongoing Saturday morning and increase in coverage
during the afternoon hours. Convective parameters are relatively
decent for this corner of the world with mixed layer CAPE
(convective available potential energy -- a value approximating the
robustness of a thunderstorm updraft should one develop) peaking
around 200-300 J/kg over the North and East Bays Saturday afternoon
with mid-level lapse rates exceeding minus 7 deg Celsius/km. While
deep layer shear is modest and largely unidirectional by afternoon
the environment appears favorable for isolated to perhaps scattered
thunderstorms. Associated hazards include lightning, locally gusty
winds, locally heavy rainfall, and (given low freezing levels) small
hail. Additional rain amounts will vary widely, with some folks
seeing nothing while localized spots under a heavy shower or storm
could receive up to around 1" or so. While the large-scale
environment appears unsupportive of widespread flooding concerns,
can`t rule out localized issues if a heavy shower or storm overstays
its welcome in an urban and/or hydrologically sensitive area.
Scattered showers and isolated thunderstorms are likely to persist
Saturday night before gradually waning/decreasing in coverage into
Sunday morning. Temperatures will feel a bit chilly given onshore
winds, increased cloud cover, and intermittent showers. Look for
highs mostly in the mid 50s to around 60 on Saturday, with readings
around 60 for Sunday. Lows each night will be mostly in the 40s.

Monday through Thursday:

A northwest flow pattern on Monday will transition to transient
upper ridging by Tuesday. This will bring quiet weather and a slight
increase in daytime temperatures.

The upper ridge will weaken in response to a low pressure system
approaching the Pacific Northwest. An attendant surface cold front
moves through our area in the Wednesday to early Thursday timeframe
bringing another chance for beneficial rain.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 447 AM PDT Fri Mar 22 2024

A cold front will traverse through the region today from the
northwest off to the southeast, bringing rain and gusty S/SW winds
ahead and through the cold frontal passage. Post-frontal rain
showers will linger after the cold frontal passage. Overall trend
for this system has been delayed with latest models/guidance.

Vicinity of SFO...Currently VFR with breezy southeasterly flow.
Winds will become gusty (20-30 knots) out of the south this
afternoon ahead of the cold front, with winds shifting southwesterly
behind it. Rain will impact the terminal this afternoon as the cold
front passes with post-frontal rain showers lingering through the
TAF period.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...Currently VFR with breezy drainage flow at
MRY and MVFR and calm at SNS. Winds will become gusty out of the
W/SW ahead and through the cold frontal passage. Rain will impact
the terminals late this afternoon as the cold front passes with post-
frontal rain showers lingering through the TAF period.

.MARINE...
(Today through Wednesday)
Issued at 447 AM PDT Fri Mar 22 2024

Today an approaching low pressure system and its accompanying
cold front will bring rain and fresh southerly breezes to the
waters from the northwest to the southeast. Winds will briefly
become westerly behind the cold front before strong northwesterly
breezes prevail by Sunday. There exists up to a 25% chance for
thunderstorm potential Saturday morning through Sunday morning
over the waters.
