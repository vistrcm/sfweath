...New AVIATION...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 305 AM PDT Fri Jun 9 2023

Near to below normal temperatures will prevail into the upcoming
weekend and into next week. Isolated showers are also expected,
mainly over the Central Coast this weekend and early next week.
Otherwise and elsewhere, widespread measurable precipitation is
not anticipated.

&&

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 305 AM PDT Fri Jun 9 2023

Widespread stratus filling in across much of the region this
morning with temperatures generally in the upper 50s. With this,
not expecting much additional cooling through sunrise. Meanwhile,
mid-to-high level clouds can be seen on satellite imagery over the
eastern Pacific associated with an approaching trough. While
stratus will gradually dissipate across the interior this
afternoon, the aforementioned higher level cloud cover will begin
to spread inland through the the day. As such, there will be less
sunshine region-wide this afternoon. Temperatures will warm into
the upper 50s to mid 60s near the coast with 70s across the warmer
interior locations. Low clouds spread back inland overnight,
similar to previous days.

.LONG TERM...
(Saturday through Thursday)
Issued at 305 AM PDT Fri Jun 9 2023

Throughout the weekend, a cut-off low pressure system is
projected to develop off of the California coast within the
broader mid/upper level trough. Generally speaking, this system is
expected to push into southern California while advecting deeper
mid/upper level moisture into the region. Some of this may spread
as far north as the Central Coast resulting in a 10-20%
probability of rain showers, largely over southern Monterey and
San Benito counties from Saturday into Sunday. The eventual track
of the cut-off low will determine if and how much rain will see.
That said, any precipitation that does occur will be light with
only a 10-15% probability of amounts exceeding 0.25" in the
aforementioned areas. As the system eventually shifts inland, the
low probabilities (generally >15%) for convection will continue
heading into Monday. Similarly, precipitation would be isolated in
nature with minimal precipitation. Nonetheless, the potential for
convection will be worth keeping an eye on in the days to come.
Also to note, cannot rule out patchy drizzle each night/morning
throughout the weekend near the coast and in places such as the
East Bay Hills due to the deep marine layer and favorable onshore
flow.

Temperatures through the weekend and into early next week will
remain below seasonal averages. Generally speaking, look for
afternoon highs in the upper 50s to mid 60s near the coast/bays and
70s across the interior. This is as cooler conditions persist aloft
in response to troughing over California. Slight warming, especially
across the interior, is expected heading into late next week as the
airmass aloft moderates and the trough weakens.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 439 AM PDT Fri Jun 9 2023

 MVFR as satellite shows stratus socked in over the terminals
with winds relatively light. High confidence as diurnal heating
takes into effect, stratus ceilings will start to lift to VFR
conditions. As we transition into another weather pattern, models
lacked agreement of when stratus will return, but had strong
confidence that some stratus will return. Therefore, expect MVFR
ceilings returning tonight into the morning. Onshore winds are
expecting to increase in the afternoon to moderate to breezy.

Vicinity of SFO...MVFR conditions. VFR conditions will enter the SF
bay area near 17Z so expect some relief from stratus. Moderate
confidence on timing and height of stratus return tonight but expect
MVFR cigs. Winds are expected to increase to breezy, but moderate
confidence on speed of gusty winds this afternoon.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...MVFR but expect VFR conditions near 18Z.
Some models suggest a early return of MVFR this evening compared to
other terminals, but models lacked agreement on timing and height.
Therefore, moderate confidence that MVFR conditions will return near
4Z today. Winds are expected to remain light to moderate.

&&

.MARINE...
(Today through Wednesday)
Issued at 305 AM PDT Fri Jun 9 2023

Northwest winds gradually strengthen across the waters from Friday
into Saturday, with the strongest occuring each afternoon and
evening. Winds diminish and turn southwesterly early next week.
Expect breezy west to northwest winds for the rest of the upcoming
work week with mixed swells.

     evening for PZZ530.
