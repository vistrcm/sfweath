...New UPDATE, MARINE...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 131 AM PDT Mon May 27 2024

Warmer today as a warming trend continues through the week.
Afternoon highs slightly above normal on tap for next weekend.

.UPDATE...
Issued at 913 AM PDT Mon May 27 2024

It`s May and this morning was still gray. Morning satellite
imagery showed a solid marine layer push overnight (1300-1800 feet
deep). In fact, maybe a little more of a inland push than
advertised on yesterday`s model guidance. Nonetheless, most recent
satellite imagery shows some thinning along the inland edges of
the marine layer stratus. Latest guidance from the HRRR captures
this thinning well and indicates this trend will continue through
11 AM. Even though inland areas will clear, coastal areas on the
other hand will hold onto stratus through out the day. Probably
not the best beach day. If you do head to the beach, be mindful of
the cold waters. Recent upwelling and persistent NW winds has led
to chilly coastal water temps.

No update needed this morning...will be monitoring stratus
clearing and adjust if needed.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 131 AM PDT Mon May 27 2024

A Deja Vu Monday for most as far as high temperatures go. A few
locations in the interior have the potential to be a couple of
degrees warmer. Summer time ridge pattern in full effect to round
out the holiday weekend. Marine layer remains intact through the
day near coastal areas with the associated stratus retreating to
the coastline by mid-to-late morning.

&&

.LONG TERM...
(Tuesday through Sunday)
Issued at 131 AM PDT Mon May 27 2024

Tranquil weather through the work week with stratus clearing to
the coast each morning. A progressive, deep upper low traverses
through the Pacific NW midweek to flatten the ridge a bit. This
will keep any further warming at bay through the middle of the
week, but isn`t expected to bring any other notable change to the
weather. As this feature departs, the ridge builds back and a
secondary warming trend continues into the weekend.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 415 AM PDT Mon May 27 2024

MVFR-IFR stratus at the coastal terminals should mix out around
18-21Z today with afternoon clearing and breezy onshore winds. Low
clouds return early this evening for the Monterey Bay terminals
and later tonight for the Bay Area.

Vicinity of SFO...Initially VFR with medium confidence in at least
temporary MVFR-IFR ceilings around 13-16Z, with a period of
prevailing sub-VFR conditions possible thereafter. Returning to
VFR this afternoon with breezy onshore winds, then low clouds
return late tonight into Tuesday morning.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...IFR stratus at the terminals should stay
in place through mid to late morning before a return to VFR
ensues. Winds will be modest and onshore. Low stratus returns
early this evening.

.MARINE...
(Today through Saturday)
Issued at 913 AM PDT Mon May 27 2024

Northwest winds begin to ease slightly today over the coastal
waters with a fresh to strong breeze continuing over the outer
waters. Winds increase into the middle of the week as an upper
low moves through the Pacific Northwest. Wave heights beginning
to increase by the middle of the work week up to 11 to 13 feet.
Otherwise mostly quiet marine conditions through the forecast
period.
