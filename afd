...New UPDATE...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 302 AM PDT Fri Jul 19 2024

Warm again going into the weekend. Short cool down Sunday with
another warm up on the way through next week.

&&

.UPDATE...
Issued at 942 AM PDT Fri Jul 19 2024

Hot weather continues today before briefly returning to near
seasonal temperatures over the weekend. Widespread moderate heat
risk is expected over the Bay Area and interior Central Coast with
pockets of major heat risk in areas of elevated terrain. For those
who are particularly sensitive to heat, remember to limit time
outdoors during peak heating (afternoon/evening) and to stay well
hydrated. Elevated fire weather concerns persist into Saturday as
warmer, drier conditions continue with gusts between 30-35 mph
possible in mountain gaps and passes (particularly across the
North Bay and East Bay). In today`s forecast package we will be
further investigating fire weather conditions/concerns and further
refining next week`s forecast high temperatures as temperatures
build again.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 302 AM PDT Fri Jul 19 2024

Another warm day today with the upper level ridge building further
into the northern Rockies. Heat Advisory remains in effect for
inland areas as moderate HeatRisk continues today, except for areas
right along the immediate coast and the Monterey Bay/Northern
Salinas Valley region. These areas will continue to benefit from a
modest marine layer that will remain intact. The upper level ridge
responsible for the heat will gradually migrate eastward, and a
transient shortwave trough begins to approach the West Coast by
tonight. As such, the Heat Advisory is set to expire this evening.

&&

.LONG TERM...
(Saturday through Thursday)
Issued at 302 AM PDT Fri Jul 19 2024

Going into Saturday, inland areas that were under the advisory can
expect to shave off as much as 8-10 degrees. An exception to this
will be southern Monterey and San Benito counties, where high temps
will still be around the 100-105 mark. Another touch cooler Sunday
when the shortwave trough moves through our area, deepening the
marine layer and potentially resulting in areas of drizzle Sunday
morning. Alas...easy come, easy go. Monday marks the start of the
next warming trend following the departure of the trough. As of this
forecast, temps look to be about what was experienced these past
couple of days. Basically Monday through Thursday we will likely see
highs between 95-105 for inland and high elevation areas, 85-95 for
lower elevations and urban areas around the SF Bay, and 65-75 for
coastal areas. This period will likely be the target for the next
heat product issuance, but we will wait for future shifts to let the
forecast develop and avoid confusing messaging with the current heat
products.

Looking out towards next weekend, ensemble cluster analysis supports
a welcome pattern change. Still a few details to be ironed out, but
a return to cooler temperatures is starting to look promising.
