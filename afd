...New UPDATE, MARINE...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 133 AM PDT Fri Sep 6 2024

Hot and dry conditions again for Friday, resulting in a moderate
to major risk of heat-related illness and near critical fire
weather conditions. A pronounced cooling trend starts on Saturday
and continues into next week.

.UPDATE...
Issued at 923 AM PDT Fri Sep 6 2024

The big picture this morning...compressed marine layer, interior
heat, and near critical to locally critical fire weather concerns.

Morning satellite imagery shows widespread clouds along the coast
and locally inland. This is a compressed marine layer thanks to
high pressure overhead. Profilers show marine layer just a few
hundred feet deep. Given the compressed nature locally dense fog
will be possible, especially along the coast like Hwy 1. Do expect
gradual clearing back to the immediate coastline, but not a
complete clearing of coastal clouds. As for the heat, Heat
Advisories still in effect. See details below for more
information. Last but not least, fire weather concerns. A very dry
airmass remains locked in over the region. A quick sampling of
weather stations show lower single digit RH values! Hawkeye RAWS,
long standing station N Bay Mts, is currently sitting at 3
percent. Thankfully, winds are not super strong, but still seeing
some gusts over 20 mph. Will continue to advertise near critical
fire weather conditions through the day as RH values are not
expected to increase much. A few days ago there was talk of
passing upper level moisture and nearby thunderstorms (dry).
Morning satellite does showing the upper level moisture to the SE
tracking north. Fortunately, cumulus field looks flat and still
not carrying any mention of thunderstorms. Finally, patchy
smoke/haze will be possible over far SE Monterey/San Benito
counties due to the nearby Boone Fire.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 133 AM PDT Fri Sep 6 2024

Today is forecast to be the last hot day across the interior, with
slight cooling tomorrow. Expecting temperatures to range from 95-
105 degrees across the the far interior and in the higher
elevations, 80`s to mid 90`s inland just away from the coast, and
upper 60`s to mid 80`s near the coast. As such, moderate HeatRisk
persist for inland areas where a Heat Advisory remains in effect
until 8 PM this evening. With high pressure aloft, dry conditions
will persist above the 500 foot marine layer as minimum humidities
this afternoon will lower to 10-30% range. Overnight humidity
recoveries will be slightly higher tonight except for the highest
peaks. Nevertheless, we are still anticipating elevated to near
critical fire weather conditions across the interior on Friday.

Tonight, expect minimum temperatures to lower into the low-to-upper
50`s near the coast and adjacent coastal valleys, near 60 degrees in
the South Bay and Santa Clara Valley, and the upper 60`s to upper
70`s in the higher elevations.

.LONG TERM...
(Saturday through Thursday)
Issued at 133 AM PDT Fri Sep 6 2024

A significant pattern change will bring relief to the region on
Saturday as the ridge flattens in response to an upper level trough
digging out of the Gulf of Alaska and into the eastern Pacific. By
Sunday, onshore flow will increase and bring temperatures back to
near seasonal averages which will continue into early next week.
Onshore winds will increase also with breezy to locally gusty
conditions in the gaps and passes. From previous forecaster:
"Heading into the later part of next week, model clusters are
starting to hint at a low pressure system that could bring some
chances for rain to the North Bay. That said, the model clusters
continue to diverge on location and timing, so uncertainty towards
this part of the period remains high."

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 514 AM PDT Fri Sep 6 2024

Mix of VFR and LIFR CIGs across the board. Confidence is lower now
that stratus will extend inland as the marine layer has stayed
compressed below 1000 ft. Night Fog shows stratus has not pushed far
into the East Bay as it was initially thought it would. LAMP
probability plots indicate some short lived stratus may be possible
13-16Z at APC, OAK, and SFO but confidence remains low. Patchy fog
continues to impact STS, MRY, and SNS with visibility and CIG height
expected to continue fluctuating through the mid morning. Winds
generally remain light and west to northwest through the morning
before more moderate northwest flow returns during the afternoon.
Locally gustier conditions may be possible for OAK and SFO during
the afternoon/evening.

Vicinity of SFO...Patchy IFR CIGs may temporarily impact SFO from 13-
16Z but confidence is low. Night Fog shows that stratus has receded
away from SFO in the last several hours and not continued its
initial strong push through the Golden Gate/into the East Bay. This
has decreased confidence in stratus developing for a prolonged
period of time at SFO and OAK. However, temporary IFR CIGs remain
possible as the main stratus bank is located just offshore of the SF
Peninsula/to the west of SFO and another inwards push cannot be
ruled out. Additionally, ensemble guidance indicated that IFR CIG
development became slightly more likely around 13/14Z. Winds
generally stay out of the northwest and strengthen during the
afternoon/evening with gusts up to 20 knots currently anticipated
with lighter winds expected overnight.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...LIFR conditions continue at MRY and SNS
with VFR returning mid to late morning. Night Fog shows an eddy
developing over the Monterey Bay which is starting to pull cloud
cover away from MRY/SNS. LIFR CIGs are still expected to be the
prevailing condition but will continue to monitor the eddy as it
develops/amend as needed. Patchy fog has been observed at MRY
overnight and remains possible through the mid morning. Light,
northwest winds continue through the morning before becoming more
moderate and west to northwest during the afternoon/evening.

.MARINE...
(Today through Wednesday)
Issued at 847 AM PDT Fri Sep 6 2024

Moderate seas with occasional raised waves along with moderate to
breezy winds are expected to continue through the weekend.
Occasional gusty conditions are possible over the southern waters,
particularly along the Big Sur coastline, but don`t look to be
consistent. Widespread strong northwest winds return into the next
work week with rougher seas following.

.MTR WATCHES/WARNINGS/ADVISORIES...
CA...Heat Advisory until 8 PM PDT this evening for CAZ502>504-506-510-
     512>518.
