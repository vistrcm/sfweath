.UPDATE...
Issued at 638 AM PST Fri Dec 26 2025

The 12Z sounding showed some signs of life remain in the
atmosphere. There is 123 J/kg of 100 mb ML CAPE, 25 kts of 0-1 km
shear and 32 kts of 0-6 km mean wind. Most of the CAPE remains
above the freezing level, but below 3 km. While the total overall
instability is marginal, this distribution optimizes the potential
for ice particles to generate thunderstorms, and low-level
updrafts to support mini supercells. The biggest issue is dry air,
but a band of 0.6-0.7 PW is expected to move through in the
18Z-00Z time frame. These late morning through afternoon hours are
our best chance for one last round of active weather before the
winds shift back to NW and everything finally calms down
overnight. It`s been a busy week, but we aren`t quite done yet.

.SHORT TERM...
Issued at 104 AM PST Fri Dec 26 2025
(Today and tonight)

Another disturbance will move through the region, bringing
additional rainshowers and perhaps some isolated thunderstorms to
the region. The primary hazards for today`s storms will be heavy
rainfall, small hail, and perhaps some stronger wind gusts. Chances
for rain begin to taper of later in the day and by Friday evening as
the disturbance tracks eastward. Winds shift to the north, which
should cutback on moisture. Showers may linger through Friday night
and into Saturday morning.

&&

.LONG TERM...
Issued at 104 AM PST Fri Dec 26 2025
(Saturday through Thursday)

Drier weather works its way into the region as upper level ridging
builds over the west. Chilly nights are tap through early next week,
thanks to high pressure and clear skies. High temperatures will be
either at or below their seasonal average for this time of year as
well. Cluster analysis shows the upper level ridge gets nudged to
our east around or just after New Year`s day, with upper level
troughing trying to set up over the Gulf of Alaska. This may end the
work with rain chances.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 353 AM PST Fri Dec 26 2025

Isolated light to moderate showers through late morning into
midday today. Low confidence in exact timing and coverage, but hi
res ensemble guidance seems to have a decent grasp on a couple of
bands of showers moving through the region between the 18-22Z
hours. Gusty S winds continue through this period, but diminish
shortly thereafter this afternoon. Skies gradually clearing into
tonight and winds begin to veer back to our typical onshore
regime.

Vicinity of SFO...A few showers invof the terminal through midday
today, and should remain light to moderate in intensity. By the
afternoon hours, showers become more widely scattered and skies
begin to clear gradually. As the strong surface low pulls away
inland, onshore NW flow looks to be restored by Saturday morning.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...A few lingers strong showers will quickly
vacate the area this morning, giving way to another round of
isolated showers by late morning. Overall precipitation intensity
trends downward gradually this afternoon.

.MARINE...
(Today through Wednesday)
Issued at 353 AM PST Fri Dec 26 2025

Additional showers continue to develop throughout the waters today
with activity gradually diminishing through the day. Winds greatly
diminish as the surface low moves inland. Rough and choppy seas
linger through today before subsiding through the weekend. Much
quieter marine conditions anticipated for next week.

.BEACHES...
Issued at 638 AM PST Fri Dec 26 2025

A High Surf Advisory is then valid for the coast through 10 PM
Friday. Expect large breaking waves up to 25 feet, strong rip
currents and sneaker waves. Dangerous swimming and surfing
conditions and localized beach erosion can be expected. Sneaker
waves can sweep across the shoreline without warning, pulling
people into the sea from rocks, jetties and beaches. Large
breaking waves can overpower swimmers resulting in significant
physical injury and increase the risk of drowning.

Stay off of jetties, piers, rocks, and other waterside
infrastructure. Remain out of the water to avoid hazardous surf
and NEVER turn your back on the ocean. Monitor local weather,
surf and tide forecasts at www.weather.gov/mtr.

.BEACHES...
Issued at 350 PM PST Thu Dec 25 2025

A Beach Hazards Statement continues for the coast through 4 AM
Friday. The main concerns include:blowing and drifting sand and
wind waves up to 20 ft. The drifting sand and increased sea spray
will also result in poor visibilities, affecting water rescues.
Increased coastal erosion will be possible as well.

A High Surf Advisory is then valid for the coast from 4 AM to 10
PM Friday. For the High Surf Advisory: expect large breaking waves
up to 25 feet, strong rip currents and sneaker waves. Dangerous
swimming and surfing conditions and localized beach erosion can be
expected. Sneaker waves can sweep across the shoreline without
warning, pulling people into the sea from rocks, jetties and
beaches. Large breaking waves can overpower swimmers resulting in
significant physical injury and increase the risk of drowning.

Inexperienced swimmers should remain out of the water due to
dangerous surf conditions.

Stay off of jetties, piers, rocks, and other waterside
infrastructure. Remain out of the water to avoid hazardous surf
and NEVER turn your back on the ocean. Monitor local weather,
