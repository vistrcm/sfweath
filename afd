.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 144 AM PDT Mon Oct 23 2023

A few isolated showers should dissipate by sunrise. Sunshine and
near normal temperatures will return this afternoon. The next couple
days will be dry and somewhat windy. Cooler temperatures and rain
potential return for the second half of the week.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 144 AM PDT Mon Oct 23 2023

Isolated showers are lingering across the Bay Area tonight, but the
clouds are starting to break in the North Bay. Dense fog is a real
concern this morning with wet ground, high humidity, clearing skies,
and light winds all seeming to line up. As soon as the Sonoma County
Airport reported cloud cover decreasing to scattered, radiational
cooling allowed the temperature to drop a few degrees and the
visibility started to plummet from 10 miles to less than 1 mile in
a little over an hour. With several hours of cooling left in the
morning and light winds across the valleys, dense fog advisories
are possible in areas where the skies clear before sunrise.

Any fog should dissipate by mid to late morning with a dry, sunny
afternoon and fall-like temperatures. Moderate NW winds are
likely to develop in the afternoon.

.LONG TERM...
(Tuesday through Sunday)
Issued at 144 AM PDT Mon Oct 23 2023

Tuesday will be similar to Monday with near normal temperatures, no
rain, and moderate NW winds in the afternoon. Wednesday will bring
increasing cloud cover ahead of the next cold front which will
approach from the north early Thursday morning. Models are all over
the place on whether this will bring us any rain, but it will be
followed up by a fast moving low pressure system from the west,
which brings a better chance of rain on Friday.

While the mid-week cold front doesn`t look to be a major
precipitation producer, it`s bringing a cold dry air mass from the
north and will trigger a noticeable drop in temperatures. Many
areas are forecast to drop into the mid to upper 40s in the early
mornings from Thu-Sun. It`s not out of the question that some
daily record low temps will be challenged in the second half of
the week.

Another drying trend is expected this weekend as a weak ridge
moves in early next week. It`s too early to say for sure, but
most models hint at a dry period between Sunday and Tuesday,
including Halloween.
