.UPDATE...
Issued at 934 AM PDT Tue Aug 5 2025

Current weather snapshot is almost a repeat of yesterday morning,
but there are some nuances with stratus coverage and winds.
Morning satellite imagery shows a little more stratus coverage
this morning, but in the big picture the marine layer is
discontinuous. If one takes a closer look you`ll notice ripples in
the stratus deck outside and upstream of the Golden Gate.
Topographical influence from Pt Reyes has led to the wave clouds
being generated.

Latest gradients around the region still indicate onshore flow.
While SFO-SAC is a tad weaker than Monday, it`s still resulting
in gusty gap/pass winds across the East Bay with gusts 30-35 mph.

No update needed this morning for near term forecast. Will be
watching how the temperatures respond today as high pressure
nudges into the region.

Lastly, there are wildfires around the state producing smoke, but
latest smoke modeling guidance keeps smoke outside of the Bay
Area.

.SHORT TERM...
Issued at 141 AM PDT Tue Aug 5 2025
(Today and tonight)

Satellite imagery shows mostly clear skies throughout the region
with patchy stratus developing near Point Reyes and the western
coast of the San Mateo Peninsula. Today marks the start of a gradual
warming trend across the region that should dominate the weather
pattern for the rest of the week. Two developing upper level highs
over the desert southwest and the eastern pacific will cause a
gradual rise in upper level heights over the state, moderated by an
upper level low passing through the Pacific Northwest. Highs today
range from the upper 70s to the middle 80s inland, reaching the
middle 90s in the warmest locations, the middle 60s to middle 70s
along the Bays, and the upper 50s to lower 60s along the Pacific
coast. The trough axis that brought us the past two days of gustier
conditions has moved off to our east, meaning that winds this
afternoon and evening should relax towards a more typical summertime
breeze.

.LONG TERM...
Issued at 141 AM PDT Tue Aug 5 2025
(Wednesday through Monday)

The gradual warming trend continues through the rest of the week
into the weekend. Inland temperatures rise to near or slightly above
the seasonal averages through the weekend, with highs reaching
the middle 80s to the middle 90s in the inland valleys, near 100
in the warmest inland spots, and the 70s to the lower 80s near the
Bays. Even the coastal regions will see some warming temperatures
as the highs tick up into the lower to middle 60s. This warming
will cause a tick up in the HeatRisk categories, but generally to
Minor to Moderate HeatRisk, with a risk for heat-related illnesses
for vulnerable populations including children, the elderly,
pregnant women, and people working or living outside without
adequate shelter or hydration. The current forecast concentrates
the Moderate HeatRisk from Friday through Sunday across the
interior valleys of the East and South Bays.

The heat is expected to gradually ease during the early part of
next week, as the upper air ridging over the western United States
begins to relax. A split in the model data emerges beyond the 7
day outlook, with ensemble model cluster analysis revealing an
approximate 60-40 split between model solutions showing continued
ridging into the middle part of next week (the ever-so-slightly
favored solution) versus those that show a subtle troughing
pattern develop over the West Coast.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 457 AM PDT Tue Aug 5 2025

Stratus is filling in over the SF Bay and along the Monterey Bay
Shoreline. SFO and OAK are expected to remain overcast through 15Z
with stratus lingering longer (closer to 17Z) along the Monterey
peninsula. Current thinking is that drier air will keep stratus from
extending to STS and APC with the HRRR in agreement to this line of
thinking. Moderate west to northwest winds strengthen during the
afternoon and evening before diminishing overnight. Moderate
confidence that MVFR-IFR stratus will return overnight to SFO, OAK,
HAF, and MRY with HAF returning closer to 06Z and OAK, SFO, and MRY
returning 09Z-11Z. For SNS and SJC, probabilistic guidance shows a
higher chance of patchy stratus developing shortly after the end of
this TAF period (12Z).

Vicinity of SFO...MVFR stratus is pushing in over SFO with highest
confidence in stratus continuing until 16Z. LAMP probabilistic
guidance shows a low (
