...New AVIATION, MARINE...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 111 AM PDT Wed May 21 2025

Above seasonal normal temperatures and hazardous marine conditions
today. Elevated fire weather conditions through Thursday.

&&

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 111 AM PDT Wed May 21 2025

Conditions are warmer and drier than they were this time last night,
but only in the higher terrain. Why? Well, last night there was a
shallow marine layer that impacted coastal areas while tonight the
region is clear and winds are calm, allowing for maximal radiational
cooling. A low amplitude upper-level shortwave ridge will trek
across the region today, bringing the warmest conditions of the
week. Temperatures will be 10 degrees above normal with
widespread minor HeatRisk and areas of moderate HeatRisk for the
Interior Bay Area and Central Coast. Elevated fire weather
conditions will continue through tomorrow for the Interior Bay
Area and Central Coast as dry conditions (poor daytime relative
humidity of 15-25%, overnight relative humidity recovery of 30-50%
in the higher terrain) and moderate to strong onshore winds
continue. The threat is primarily in the finer, flashier fuels of
brush and grass as recent offshore flow and warm conditions
continue to cure them.

.LONG TERM...
(Thursday through Tuesday)
Issued at 111 AM PDT Wed May 21 2025

The lack of a longwave pattern over the region is evident in the
extended forecast. An upper-level shortwave trough will skirt the
region Thursday, causing temperatures to return to seasonal normals.
A second, deeper upper-level shortwave trough will dig into the
region Friday, bringing the coolest conditions of the week. An upper-
level longwave ridge builds into the West Saturday which will bring
temperatures up to 5 degrees above normal. Global ensemble
clusters show an Omega Block, the combination of two cutoff lows
with one blocking high sandwiched between them, developing by
Sunday. By nature, this will lead to uncertainty and low
confidence in the progression of the longwave pattern into early
next week as these features have very weak forcing and thus can
be persistent.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 404 AM PDT Wed May 21 2025

Currently a mix of IFR-VFR at the terminals. High pressure is
allowing for clear skies outside of the Monterey Bay where a
compressed/shallow marine layer has returned. High confidence in
widespread VFR by late-morning and onshore winds prevailing through
the TAF period.

Vicinity of SFO...Currently VFR with westerly flow. High confidence
in VFR and westerly winds prevailing through the TAF period.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...Currently IFR with southwesterly flow at
MRY and IFR with westerly flow at SNS. High confidence in VFR
prevailing by late-morning. Low to moderate confidence on the return
of IFR ceilings tonight with probabilities only in the 20-50% range.
Onshore winds will prevail through the TAF period.

&&

.MARINE...
(Today through Monday)
Issued at 404 AM PDT Wed May 21 2025

Hazardous marine conditions continue today as strong northwesterly
breezes with near gale to gale force gusts and rough to very rough
seas persist. Winds will slowly diminish and seas will slowly
abate tonight with fresh northwesterly breezes with strong gusts
and moderate to rough seas prevailing Thursday through Sunday.
