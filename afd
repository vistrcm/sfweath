.UPDATE...
Issued at 937 AM PDT Wed Aug 6 2025

We did a have marine layer again this morning, but with high
pressure nosing in aloft it was more compressed. The compression led
to some patchy fog (locally dense at Salinas), patchy
drizzle/mist, and earlier clearing of morning clouds. Based on
satellite trends it looks like Monterey Bay region will be the
last to clear of morning clouds. Otherwise, as noted below the
bigger story today will be the anticipated warmer weather across
the interior.  No update needed to ongoing forecast.

Two broader scale items of note that we`re watching: Visible
satellite imagery shows a swath of upper level clouds from the
PacNW stretching south to the North Bay. These clouds are
associated with an upper level trough and anchored parent low
near BC. While our forecast is currently dry and not expecting any
precip it is interesting to note that some model guidance does
generate some potential for convection well offshore. As the
upper trough becomes more pronounced and deepens, instability
increases at the base of the trough leading to an overlap of
MUCAPE/lapse rates/moisture. The other item of note is the large
high parked over the Desert SW. On the western periphery some
upper level moisture from TS Henriette is being pulled NE. Current
thinking is the upstream trough will help "block" this moisture
and keep it confined farther south.

.SHORT TERM...
Issued at 1248 AM PDT Wed Aug 6 2025
(Today and tonight)

Satellite imagery shows mostly clear skies throughout the region
with patchy stratus along the immediate coast near Half Moon Bay,
Davenport, and the Pebble Beach/Carmel-by-the-Sea region. Some
stratus expansion is possible at the immediate coastal regions
through the morning. The state is squeezed between two upper level
highs, one over the desert southwest, the other over the eastern
Pacific, with a trough squeezed between the two. Lows this morning
range from the lower to middle 50s in the lower elevations into
the 60s in the higher elevations. Highs today range from the
middle 80s to the middle 90s inland, reaching the upper 90s in the
warmest locations, the 70s to middle 80s along the Bays, and the
lower to middle 60s along the Pacific coast. The warmest far
interior regions will edge into Moderate HeatRisk today. Gusty
onshore winds will develop in the afternoon and evening with the
gusts reaching 20-25 mph along the coast and through favored gaps,
passes, and the Salinas Valley.

.LONG TERM...
Issued at 1248 AM PDT Wed Aug 6 2025
(Thursday through Tuesday)

Temperatures on Thursday will be around the same down to 4 degrees
cooler as those today, as the squeezed trough slightly deepens with
an upper level low passing into the Pacific Northwest through the
Northern Rockies. As the upper level low passes on Friday, allowing
the ridge over the Eastern pacific to build northward towards the
ocean off the Pacific Northwest and British Columbia, temperatures
will rise again with the heat continuing through the weekend and
lingering into Monday. High temperatures in the warmest places
(eastern Contra Costa County, southern Monterey County) edge into
the triple digits, and Moderate HeatRisk extends throughout the
interior East Bay, South Bay, and inland Napa County on Friday and
Saturday. Temperatures are expected to fall starting the middle of
next week, as the upper level ridge begins to relax.

From the previous forecaster: Two things that we`re monitoring
closely: fire weather and TS Henriette. Will continue to advertise
elevated fire weather concerns through early next week with warm and
dry conditions coupled with daily onshore pushes. Additionally,
higher terrain will not see much in the way of relief. TS Henriette
is currently 1000 nm SW of Baja. Water Vapor does show some upper
level moisture being advected northward. However, model guidance
doesn`t bring any of that moisture to CA around the Desert SW high.
Obviously, if we pull in some tropical moisture into CA that would
change things, but for now it looks dry.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 457 AM PDT Wed Aug 6 2025

Patchy stratus is building in along the coastline with a more
widespread bank of stratus located just offshore. Highest confidence
in stratus reaching MRY, SNS, and HAF with slightly lower confidence
in stratus reaching OAK. Looking at CIGs at least temporarily
filling in over OAK and HAF after 12Z. Stratus should clear by mid
to late morning with guidance generally on board with a more
widespread return of stratus tonight. ECMWF and GFS guidance show a
little more low and mid level moisture moving in tonight in
comparison to the previous few days which should support more
widespread stratus coverage. Moderate onshore winds return this
afternoon/evening before diminishing overnight.

Vicinity of SFO...VFR through tonight with guidance leaning towards
MVFR CIGs returning early tomorrow morning. Highest confidence in
CIGs returning around 11Z tomorrow morning but LAMP probabilistic
guidance suggests some potential for CIGs to return closer to 09Z
with CIGs lasting through the end of the TAF period. Winds remain
out of the west to northwest with breezy afternoon and evening winds
gusting to around 24 knots.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...LIFR CIGs at MRY continue through mid to
late morning before VFR conditions return. Stratus has been slowly
approaching SNS over the last few hours with moderate confidence
that IFR-LIFR CIGs will reach SNS by 13Z before clearing by mid
morning. Moderate confidence that stratus will return late this
evening at MRY and early tomorrow morning at SNS. Winds generally
remain out of the northwest with moderate winds between 8 to 12
knots expected during the afternoon and evening hours.

.MARINE...
(Today through Monday)
Issued at 937 AM PDT Wed Aug 6 2025

Expect widespread fresh to strong northwesterly gusts today and
Thursday. A coastal jet looks to develop off of Point Reyes which
will bring near gale force gusts across the northern coastal
waters. Winds diminish beginning Friday with a gentle to moderate
breeze prevailing through the weekend. Moderate seas persist
through the forecast period, with a brief period of 10 to 11 foot
wave heights in the northern outer waters on Friday.

&&

.FIRE WEATHER...
Issued at 937 AM PDT Wed Aug 6 2025

After coordination calls this morning with fire partners we`ll be
hoisting a headline for the afternoon fire weather forecast. The
headline will mainly focus on the increasing temperatures coupled
with the lower humidity Friday and over the weekend. The greatest
areas of concern will be the higher terrain and interior
locations. Low elevations will see better humidity recovery, but
higher terrain will be persistently dry. Daily sea breeze pushes
occuring during peak heating will also elevate concerns.

Taking a look at the Hot Dry Windy index also highlights concerns
pushing values into the 95th percentile later in the weekend and
early next week.
