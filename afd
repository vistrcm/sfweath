...New AVIATION...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 1200 AM PDT Sat Apr 27 2024

High pressure brings quiet weather and slowly warming temperatures
through next week. Breezy onshore winds will keep temperatures
along the coast cooler through the weekend.

&&

.UPDATE...
Issued at 923 AM PDT Sat Apr 27 2024

Morning visible satellite reveals an atypical marine layer with
patchy stratus hugging the San Mateo/San Francisco Peninsula
coast and Monterey Bay region. Stratus has also moved inland
covering the Salinas Valley and portions of the Berkeley/Oakland
Hills. As noted below, despite some clouds this morning do
expect ample sunshine by this afternoon. In fact, it should be
one of the sunnier days as of late. Increased sunshine and a warm
airmass over the region will lead to warmer temperatures this
afternoon. All in all, pretty nice start to the weekend. One
weather item of note will be the winds. Breezy onshore flow will
persist with gusts 15-30 mph, especially near the immediate
coast.

No update needed.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 1200 AM PDT Sat Apr 27 2024

High pressure at the surface and aloft will strengthen offshore as
northwest flow prevails aloft across our area. Winds will remain
breezy and onshore, keeping temperatures along the coast in the
upper 50s to lower 60s this afternoon. Inland areas farther removed
from this cool marine influence will see afternoon highs reach the
upper 60s to lower 70s. Some coastal cloud cover will linger into
the late morning hours but most areas should see the sun by early
afternoon. For tonight look for lows in the 40s, except for lower
50s along the immediate coast and within urbanized areas.

&&

.LONG TERM...
(Sunday through Friday)
Issued at 1200 AM PDT Sat Apr 27 2024

A weak upper level ridge will build through the weekend,
transitioning into more zonal flow in the early part of the work
week. As a result, a storm system approaching the West Coast will be
diverted towards the Pacific Northwest and will dump its rain there.
The lack of precipitation and cloud cover will contribute to a
warming trend through the next week. High temperatures into the
early part of the work week will peak in the low to mid 70s inland
and low to mid 60s at the coast. Beyond midweek, the warming
continues with inland highs reaching the upper 70s and maybe into
the low 80s, while coastal locations see highs into the mid to
upper 60s. CPC climatic outlooks suggest a lean towards
temperatures below seasonal averages, and precipitation above
seasonal averages, to begin the first couple weeks of May. For
context: for downtown San Francisco, May`s average high is 64, and
its average seasonal precipitation is 0.70 inches.

.AVIATION...
(18Z TAFS)
Issued at 1001 AM PDT Sat Apr 27 2024

Currently a mix of VFR and MVFR at the terminals. Building high
pressure and a subsequent strengthening of the pressure gradient
will continue to allow for strong and gusty northwesterly winds
at the terminals today. Gusts of 20-30 knots are to be expected at
all terminals. Winds will slowly begin to diminish tonight. VFR
through the TAF period at all terminals except MRY, SJC, and SNS.

Vicinity of SFO...Currently VFR with breezy westerly flow. VFR
through the TAF period. Winds will continue to ramp up through the
morning with gusts up to 30 knots to be expected through this
evening. Winds will somewhat diminish overnight before resuming
strong and gusty westerly flow tomorrow afternoon.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...Currently MVFR with westerly flow at both
terminals. SNS will be clearing out shortly with MRY set to clear by
this afternoon. Winds will be breezy out of the west/westnorthwest
through the TAF period. MVFR stratus returns to both terminals by
the early morning hours of Sunday.

.MARINE...
(Today through Thursday)
Issued at 840 AM PDT Sat Apr 27 2024

Building high pressure and a subsequent strengthening of the
pressure gradient will allow for strong northwesterly winds to
prevail through the weekend. Gale force gusts will be possible,
especially over the coastal waters. Moderate period northwesterly
swell will continue to move through the waters through Thursday.
