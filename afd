.UPDATE...
Issued at 900 AM PST Thu Jan 1 2026

The occluded front has moved across the region this morning
producing widespread light to moderate rain. Rainfall over the
past 24 hours has been greatest in the coastal ranges with
1.50-3.00" with Mining Ridge (in the Santa Lucia Range) picking up
just over 5.00". Elsewhere, totals range from 0.25-1.50" across
the remainder of Bay Area and Central Coast. As the mid/upper
level cut of low moves onshore across the Central Coast here
shortly, precipitation will be largely confidence to the coastal
ranges through the remainder of the morning. There remains a
slight chance for thunderstorms through early afternoon across the
Central Coast and southern portions of the Bay Area, yet none
have developed at this time. No changes anticipated this morning
as the ongoing forecast remains on track.

.SHORT TERM...
Issued at 1201 AM PST Thu Jan 1 2026
(Today and tonight)

Light rain continues across the Bay Area as the new year begins.
While the total rainfall over the last 24 hours has been less
than 1", the troposphere has become totally saturated. The PW was
measured at 1.38" on the 00Z sounding. That`s near the daily max,
and in the top 0.3% of December soundings. The low level dry
layer mentioned yesterday has been eliminated. In fact, the first
dry layer is in the stratosphere. Despite the anonymously high
moisture, rain rates were held in check by a lack of lift. We
haven`t had a front move through yet to wring out the sponge. That
will change this morning as an occluded front moves across the
Bay Area and Central Coast. This will increase the rain intensity,
and brings a slight to moderate chance of thunderstorms. High
resolution models show the best chance over the Central Coast and
South Bay around 4-7 AM. After the front moves through showers
will become more scattered and the clouds will lift and lighten.
There is a second round of showers possible in the afternoon as
the instability rises with warmer surface temperatures under the
new cold air mass. A NAM point sounding at Salinas valid at 11 AM
shows some instability (41 J/kg surface CAPE), winds backing with
height(16kt 0-1km shear), and good low level moisture (91% LowRH).
One limiting factor is the high freezing level (7,500+ ft). Most
of the instability is in the warmer air below this level. This
will limit the amount of ice in the clouds necessary for static
electricity build up, significantly hurting the chances for
thunderstorms to form after the front passes. The other issues is
drier air behind the front. Most likely we will get a break after
the morning push of stronger rain, with only isolated to scattered
showers expected for the rest of the day and into Friday.

.LONG TERM...
Issued at 1201 AM PST Thu Jan 1 2026
(Friday through Wednesday)

The mostly dry break now looks like it will continue through the
majority of the day Friday before the main event of the week
arrives Friday night. A strong cold front will quickly approach
the coast, with southerly winds increasing to a strong breeze.
These winds will pump a new round of tropical moisture, this time
from the SW. With stronger winds and a lifting mechanism from
FROPA, strong showers and thunderstorms are possible into Saturday
morning. With the stronger forcing, these storms also have a
marginal chance of hitting severe criteria. Even if storms don`t
produce damaging winds, the synoptic flow will likely bring some
wind impacts across the cwa. Gusts should reach 40-50 mph along
the coast and in higher terrain. While not quite as strong as last
week, some tree damage and power outages are expected. Southerly
winds also produce storm surge thanks to the Ekman Transport. This
surge will combine with the ongoing king tides to bring
exceptionally high tides on Saturday morning, in particular.

As the cold front passes, the 500 mb temperature will drop from
around -16C to -23C. This will cause lapse rate to steepen, and
could support deeper convection in the post frontal environment on
Saturday. A reinforcing front is due on Sunday, bringing yet
another round of heavier rain, but less damaging winds. While the
rain intensity should start to lighten up next week, the pattern
remains unsettled through the 8th or 9th.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 445 AM PST Thu Jan 1 2026

Light to moderate winds are expected through the TAF period. Expect
mostly light to showers through the morning, with chances reducing
int the late morning and early afternoon. Winds will stay
southeasterly to southerly through the day for most sites. Light
spotty showers return in evening and into the night for the more
northern TAF sites before exiting into early Friday. CIGS will range
from IFR-levels in some of the interior valleys to VFR heights in
the more southern sites. Nearly widespread VFR returns into early
Friday as the system exits.

Vicinity of SFO...Showers continue to move through the area, causing
slight reductions in visibilities with IFR/MVFR level CIGs. Expect
mostly light to moderate easterly winds through the morning before
winds become more southerly and breezy into the afternoon as CIGs
scatter. Showers exit in the mid afternoon, but another batch of
slight chances for scattered light rain arrives in the late evening
but exit again into the late night.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...Moderate showers exit into the mid morning,
with lingering light showers lasting into the afternoon. Expect
mostly mid-level clouds through the TAF period. Winds stay light to
moderate through the TAF period and range from southerly to
southeasterly. Shower chances reduce and exit into the afternoon as
cloud cover scatters.

.MARINE...
(Today through Tuesday)
Issued at 900 AM PST Thu Jan 1 2026

Scattered showers continue across the coastal waters through the
rest of today. Winds have reduced across much of the waters but
borderline small craft advisory conditions continue with gusts to
around 21 knots. Hazardous conditions return overnight Thursday
into Friday as winds rapidly strengthen to gale force. Gale force
to near gale force winds will then continue through late Sunday
before winds decrease early next week. Light to moderate rain and
a slight chance of thunderstorms continues through the weekend.
Rain chances and breezy winds continue into next week.

.BEACHES...
Issued at 900 AM PST Thu Jan 1 2026

Perigean spring tides (King Tides) will impact the region through
Sunday. This is due to the combination of the full moon on 1/3,
lunar perigee on 1/1, and perihelion on 1/3. In other words all
three planetary bodies are lined up and close to each other. In
addition to the high astronomical tide, the incoming low pressure
system will bring strong southerly winds, generating some storm
surge. The combination of these factors will bring minor to
moderate coastal flooding to the low-lying areas near shorelines
and tidal waterways during high tide through Sunday. At the San
Francisco tidal gauge, high tide is expected to be 2.2 ft above
normal at 9:34 AM Friday, 2.5 ft above normal at 10:26 AM
Saturday, and 1.8 ft above normal at 11:18 AM Sunday. These
predictions include up to 1.3 feet of storm surge that will
enhance the astronomical tide and flooding threat. High tide
varies up to 90 minutes earlier or later along the Pacific Coast
and through the San Francisco Bay, respectively.
