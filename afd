.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 300 AM PDT Sat May 27 2023

Weather conditions largely remain unchanged with unseasonably
cool temperatures through the forecast period. Widespread night
and morning low clouds will give way to inland clearing each
afternoon. The longer range outlook shows this pattern will likely
persist into early June.

&&

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 300 AM PDT Sat May 27 2023

While there has been some day-to-day variations in weather
conditions largely as a result of cloud cover and associated
marine layer, a persistent pattern remains in place with an
unseasonably cool mid/upper level trough aloft. As such, low
clouds that cleared in many areas Friday evening have filled back
inland over a majority of the region. Additionally, automated
observations are once again reporting light precipitation in the
form of drizzle. Areas most favorable locations at this hour are
in the East Bay Hills and Sonoma Mountains where upslope within
the moist boundary layer is greatest. For the remainder of the
day, low clouds will once again dissipate inland as a result of
surface heating. Similar to Friday, clouds may scatter out in
places around the southern Monterey Bay while prevailing much of
the day along the remainder of the coastline. The mid/upper level
trough does shift inland slightly today allowing for slightly
warmer inland temperatures. Thus, afternoon temperatures will
largely depend on clearing of stratus with upper 50s to lower 60s
near the coast and mid/upper 60s to lower 70s inland. For tonight,
expect more of the same with low clouds returning back inland and
early morning drizzle in favored locations.

.LONG TERM...
(Sunday through Friday)
Issued at 300 AM PDT Sat May 27 2023

The aforementioned inland shift of the mid/upper level trough
will be quickly replaced by an upper level cut-off low dropping
southward down the Pacific Northwest and northern California
coast. The latest short-range guidance including CAMS suggest the
development of convection over the interior of northern California
by Sunday afternoon with movement toward the south- southwest. As
such, there is a low (10-30%) potential for showers and/or
thunderstorms to move into far northern Sonoma and Napa counties
if development were to occur. Aside from this, unseasonably cool
conditions will prevail through much of the upcoming week.
Widespread cloud cover will return each night with patchy drizzle
in the favored upslope areas before giving way to mostly sunny
conditions across the interior each afternoon.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 434 AM PDT Sat May 27 2023

Widespread MVFR conditions with isolated IFR level cigs. Any
mention for LIFR conditions was taken out of this iteration of the
TAFs due to lack of confidence. Patchy drizzle has about a 10
percentage to 15% chance for developing, but not expecting
widespread coverage let alone a wetting rain. Main impact will be
the late clearing. Interior areas are forecast for clearing after
17Z with coastal terminals holding on until 20Z. Stratus returns
Saturday night as the pressure gradients steepens.

Vicinity of SFO...MVFR conditions have been holding fairly steady
through the overnight. The IFR conditions from the 06Z TAF were
converted to prevailing for a short window for Saturday morning.
A limited window of VFR Saturday afternoon, but earlier return of
clouds Saturday night. Winds remain onshore and breezy.

SFO Bridge Approach...Clouds with bases around 1,500 feet are
forecast over the approach over the South Bay through at least
20Z on Saturday.

Monterey Bay Terminals...MVFR. Late clearing once again, between
20Z and 21Z. Earlier return for clouds just after 00Z. Cigs ill
once again start at MVFR with a chance for IFR, but there is low
confidence in that currently.

.MARINE...
(Today through Thursday)
Issued at 300 AM PDT Sat May 27 2023

Moderate northwest winds will prevail with the strongest out over
the northern coastal waters through Memorial Day. Breezy to gusty
westerly winds across the San Francisco Bay, San Pablo Bay,
Suisun Bay, the Delta in the afternoons before diminishing into
the night. A series of moderate to long period southerly swells
will also persist into early next week.

.MTR WATCHES/WARNINGS/ADVISORIES...

PZ...Small Craft Advisory from 9 PM this evening to 9 AM PDT Sunday
     for PZZ540-575.
