.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 1235 AM PST Fri Dec 8 2023

High pressure will bring quiet weather over the next several days.
Cold overnights and interior frost/freezing conditions are
expected before a gradual warming trend occurs early next week.

&&

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 1235 AM PST Fri Dec 8 2023

A surface cold front was pushing south of the area this morning as
an expansive low-level ridge builds into the region from the eastern
Pacific. The post-frontal regime brought a colder airmass and drying
aloft, albeit with enough residual surface layer moisture remaining
for pockets of fog -- some locally dense -- to develop. Outside of
monitoring visibility this morning the primary concern is colder
temperatures. Readings are already dipping into the 30s within the
coldest interior valleys this morning and Freeze Warnings remain in
effect for the North Bay and interior Monterey and San Benito
Counties. High temperatures this afternoon should rebound into the
upper 50s to near 60 before even colder conditions arrive tonight.
Given ideal conditions for radiational cooling the coldest portions
of the area should reach into frost/freeze territory once again.
Thus the Freeze Watches for the North Bay Valleys and interior
Monterey and San Benito Counties were converted to Freeze Warnings
for tonight. Make sure to protect people, pets, plants and pipes
from the cold.

.LONG TERM...
(Saturday through Thursday)
Issued at 1235 AM PST Fri Dec 8 2023

The primary concern through the weekend remains cold overnight
temperatures. A Freeze Warning will continue for the North Bay
valleys and inland Central Coast Saturday morning. Freeze Watches
were also hoisted for these same areas for late Saturday night into
Sunday morning.

Relatively quiet weather will prevail for the remainder of the week
with gradually warming daytime temperatures. Overnight readings will
remain cool however with the coldest interior locations dipping into
the upper 30s and 40s. Daytime highs will be mostly in the 60s.

Looking ahead deterministic models and their ensembles suggest a
more unsettled pattern may develop around December 16th-18th. But
that`s pretty far out for the moment so we`ll need time for the
details to be ironed out. That said, it looks like rain will re-
enter the forecast picture around this time.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 307 AM PST Fri Dec 8 2023

Patchy MVFR with mist in the North Bay, VFR elsewhere. While the
conditions were close, widespread dense fog does not look like it
will materialize this morning. Some patches remain, but the
overall trend has been improving, despite the temperatures
continuing to drop to several degrees below normal. The saving
grace was dry air behind the recently passed cold front. There was
just enough wind to mix the drier air down to the surface and keep
the dew point out of reach of the rapidly falling temperatures
overnight. STS will likely improve to VFR within a couple hours,
while the timing at APC is a little more uncertain.

Vicinity of SFO...VFR with gentle to moderate NW wind today.
Mostly sunny skies will prevail through the TAF period and beyond.
By tonight, winds will gradually shift from NW to N and possibly
NE by Sat morning, although speeds will remain light.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO

Monterey Bay Terminals...VFR conditions for both MRY and SNS
through the TAF period. There`s a small chance SNS will develop
MVFR visibility before sunrise, and the TAF hints at this with 6SM
BR in the morning. Otherwise it looks like a good day to fly with
light winds increasing to a gentle NW breeze in the afternoon.

&&

.MARINE...
(Today through Wednesday)
Issued at 307 AM PST Fri Dec 8 2023

Moderate to fresh northerly breezes will prevail today behind a
cold front. Elevated seas will remain in place into tonight as a
series of long period northwest swells propagate through the
waters. Fresh to strong breezes are expected to return for the
offshore waters by early to mid next week.
