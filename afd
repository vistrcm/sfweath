.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 107 AM PST Wed Feb 28 2024

Cooler and unsettled conditions return for tomorrow into the
weekend with rain, gusty winds, and the possibility for high
elevation snow. Cold temperatures linger into early next week with
frost and freezing temperatures possible on Sunday and Monday
mornings.

&&

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 107 AM PST Wed Feb 28 2024

A shortwave ridge aloft will remain across the region this morning
before flattening in response to a deep low pressure system dropping
equatorward from the Gulf of Alaska. This will promote a return to
cool onshore breezes today with highs ranging from the upper 50s
along the coastal interface to the lower/mid 60s elsewhere. Portions
of the southern Salinas Valley may near the 70 degree mark. Clouds
will be on the increase tonight with rain showers reaching the North
Bay during the predawn hours. Rain accumulations before sunrise
should be rather light and the on the order of about 0.15" or so
within the higher elevations of the North Bay. Not looking for much
in the way of accumulations elsewhere across the Bay Area...yet.
Given the increased cloud cover and onshore flow overnight low
temperatures will be a bit milder and mostly in the 40s outside some
30s in the higher terrain of the Central Coast and Santa Clara
hills.

.LONG TERM...
(Thursday through Tuesday)
Issued at 107 AM PST Wed Feb 28 2024

The forecast remains on track for wet, cool, and unsettled
conditions into the weekend. This is well captured in the previous
discussion which is appended below.

LONG TERM...
(Wednesday night through next Monday)
Issued at 102 PM PST Tue Feb 27 2024

Unsettled weather returns as the cold upper low digs south into our
area. Rain chances increase through the overnight hours Wed into
Thursday morning. Light to moderate widespread rain will approach
first the North Bay Thursdsay morning, spreading south as the
surface cold front progresses south. More rain in the form of
scattered showers will continue behind the cold front as the
upper level support/lift persists over the region through
Saturday.

Friday evening into Saturday morning features a slight chance for
more convective showers and maybe even thunderstorms as colder air
aloft starts to funnel into the N Bay, resulting in some marginal
instability. This period is where we could see some more moderate to
heavy rain rates, especially in the N Bay where better forcing will
exist.

Cold air will continue to settle into the region Saturday and will
linger through at least Monday. In the North Bay (where temps will
be the coldest), 850 mb temperatures are expected to dip into the -2
to -4 degC range (depending on which model you look at). This
translates to 24 degF to 29 degF at roughly 4000 feet. To give
context on how cold this airmass is, 12z OAK sounding climatology
dating back to 1948 indicates an 850 mb temp of -2 degC is below
the 10th percentile for this time of year. The minimum 850 mb temp
for March 3 is -4 degC, so we are approaching the daily minimum
temperature. At the surface, this translates to cold mornings with
freezing temps possible especially in the North Bay valleys, E
Bay interior valleys, and southern Santa Clara valley Sun-Mon.
These cold temperatures pose a hazard to unsheltered and
marginally sheltered populations.

Mountain snow continues to look likely across higher peaks (above
2000 ft) on Saturday, so not expecting it to impact lower
elevations (ie populated areas), unlike the snow we saw last
February 2023 that was more impactful. Snow accumulations will be
fairly light with only a few inches expected on peaks such as Mt
Hamilton, Mt St Helena, and high peaks of the Santa Lucias.

Overall, this period of unsettled weather will have relatively minor
impacts from a rain/flooding standpoint as the rain will be
spread out over 3 days (Thurs-Sat). Nuisance roadway flooding is
the most likely impact. This weekend, simply put, just won`t be a
fun time to be outside with it being wet, windy, and cold.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 225 AM PST Wed Feb 28 2024

VFR today, increasing coastal low clouds /MVFR-IFR/ tonight and
Thursday morning. Morning satellite imagery shows low clouds out
over the offshore waters, these clouds will become advected toward
land tonight and Thursday with increasingly breezy to gusty southwest
winds aloft. Post 12z Thursday gusty southwesterly winds aloft
resulting in low level wind shear over the Bay Area.

Vicinity of SFO...VFR. MVFR ceiling developing late tonight and early
Thursday morning. Low level wind shear developing Thursdsay morning.
Mainly light wind today, increasing to near 10 knots this afternoon
and evening. Wind shifting to southwest near 5 knots tonight then
shifting to southeasterly and increasing to 10 to 12 knots Thursdsay
morning.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...VFR. MVFR ceilings developing tonight and
Thursday morning. Light easterly to southeasterly winds this morning,
becoming onshore near 10 knots this afternoon. Winds light onshore
to southerly tonight and Thursday morning.
