Area Forecast Discussion...UPDATED
National Weather Service San Francisco CA
943 AM PDT Mon Apr 21 2025

...New UPDATE, MARINE...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 1231 AM PDT Mon Apr 21 2025

Inland areas will be warmer than normal through Tuesday before
flipping to cooler than normal late week.

&&

.UPDATE...
Issued at 940 AM PDT Mon Apr 21 2025

The inherited short term forecast is in good shape, with just a
few minor tweaks to sky trends for the rest of this morning and
early afternoon. Widespread cloud cover and pockets of fog linger
this morning as the marine layer remains in place. Cloud cover
will gradually erode thanks to the mid to late April sun.
Clearing should take place such that highs will remain 5 to 10
degrees above normal. Otherwise, onshore breezes will kick in
later this morning and into the afternoon with speeds approaching
or exceeding 25 mph, especially across the higher terrain and
through the gaps/channels.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 1231 AM PDT Mon Apr 21 2025

With weak zonal flow aloft, the weather is pretty benign today.
The Ft. Ord profiler is measuring the marine layer at 1,500 feet
tonight. As a result, the coastal stratus deck extends into the
San Francisco Bay and through the majority of the Salinas Valley.
These clouds will mix out by noon before what should be an
beautiful afternoon. High temperatures are expected to approach 80
degrees in the warmer inland areas such as Santa Rosa, Livermore,
and San Jose. That`s about 5-10 degrees above normal, but no
where near record territory. Despite the clouds mixing out,
coastal areas will remain in the cooler marine layer air, with
more seasonal temperatures generally in the 60s.

&&

.LONG TERM...
(Tuesday through Sunday)
Issued at 1231 AM PDT Mon Apr 21 2025

Tuesday will start with less clouds than Monday as the marine
layer compresses to around 500 feet. Otherwise the warmer
temperatures will continue Tuesday afternoon, although an evening
breeze will bring more of a chill as the sun goes down. In the
upper levels, a moderate trough will move through far northern
California late Tuesday - Wednesday. At the same time, the warm
thickness tongue across California will smooth out causing
surface temperatures to drop fairly significantly Wednesday. With
more upper level moisture resulting in high cloud cover,
additional cooling is expected Thursday, by which point
temperatures will be roughly roughly 5-10 degrees lower than
normal. A deeper trough approaches the coast on Friday. There is
still some uncertainty regarding the timing and strength of this
system, but the overall trend has been drier over the last couple
days of model data. There`s still a slight to moderate chance of
very light rain Fri- Sat, but the chance for more significant rain
>0.1" is currently only around 20% according to the NBM. Whether
it rains or not, this system will likely bring some stronger
onshore winds, with gusts up to 20 or 30 mph at times. The
influence of this trough will likely extend into early next week
before ridging returns.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 440 AM PDT Mon Apr 21 2025

Widespread low CIGS and light winds continue through the morning.
Pockets of fog are also affecting STS and HAF. CIGs lower around the
Monterey Bay as well as APC further into the morning, getting to
LIFR levels. This is while inconsistent CIGs affect SFO and SJC.
CIGs linger into the late morning and early afternoon with
widespread VFR expected through the afternoon. Moderate to breezy
winds build into the afternoon, and last into the evening and early
night. IFR CIGS fill over the Monterey Bay terminals again into
Monday night, with HAF seeing CIGs arrive later that night.

Vicinity of SFO...Moments of MVFR CIGS linger into the mid morning
before eroding. Winds stay light into the early afternoon before
moderate to breezy west winds build for the afternoon. These winds
will reduce overnight but remain westerly. Winds become lighter and
more variable into early Tuesday morning.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...IFR CIGS lower further into the early
morning becoming LIFR with pockets of fog reducing visibilities and
winds stay mostly light. Winds build in the late morning as CIGs
erode, with VFR expected into the afternoon. Winds reduce into the
early night as IFR CIGs move inland and fill over the terminals.

&&

.MARINE...
(Today through Saturday)
Issued at 940 AM PDT Mon Apr 21 2025

North to northwest winds continue to increase in the northern
outer waters along with building northerly swell today. Occasional
gale force northerly wind gusts, potentially as early as this
afternoon, are forecast across the northernmost outer marine
zones. Winds appear to subside some later through the week with
peak wind gusts around 20 to 25 knots, resulting in hazardous
boating conditions for smaller vessels.
