...New AVIATION...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 1132 PM PST Wed Nov 22 2023

Dry and mild today. Breezy winds develop in the hills tonight into
Friday. Cold overnight readings for Friday and Saturday morning
with frost and freezing conditions likely in the coldest interior
valleys.

&&

.SHORT TERM...
(Thursday and Thursday night)
Issued at 1132 PM PST Wed Nov 22 2023

A shortwave trough will progress through the region as a a closed
upper low evolves over the Great Basin. Meanwhile amplified upper
ridging will prevail over the northeast Pacific. A weak surface cold
front will push through the Bay Area by this afternoon with little
appreciable weather changes outside of some high level clouds. As
surface high pressure builds across the Great Basin this evening a
modest offshore pressure gradient will develop between this feature
and some weak low-level troughing across coastal California. This
will bring breezy conditions to the hills, with the North and East
Bay being most pinged for higher wind gusts late today into Friday.
Still not looking like a widespread Wind Advisory event, but
wouldn`t be surprised to see some 45+ mph gusts within the highest
terrain. Temperatures today will be seasonal with highs mostly in
the 60s. Lows tonight will drop into the 40s (along the coast) and
30s (inland areas). Frost and freezing temperature are possible,
with the greatest potential for this within far southern Monterey
County where a Frost Advisory is in effect.

&&

.LONG TERM...
(Friday through next Wednesday)
Issued at 1132 PM PST Wed Nov 22 2023

Benign weather will be in place through the weekend. A period of
breezy winds remains possible in the hills on Friday. Winds will
ease thereafter for the remainder of the week. The primary
concern remains cold temperatures on Friday night into Saturday
morning with excellent radiational cooling. A Freeze Watch is now
in effect for southern Monterey and San Benito Counties during
this time, and a Frost Advisory and/or Freeze Watch may be
necessary for the North Bay Valleys with future forecast updates.
Dry weather will prevail through mid week with low end shower
chances creeping into the picture towards the week`s end.
