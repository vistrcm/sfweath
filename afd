.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 1200 AM PST Wed Dec 27 2023

Key Messages:

* Rain showers and strong southerly winds today.
* Wind Advisory for the North Bay Pacific Coast today due to gusts
  up to 40-50 mph.
* Coastal Flood Advisory for the San Francisco Bay shoreline and the
  North Bayshore from 9 AM to 1 PM for high astronomical tides
* High Surf Warning for all Pacific coastlines from 3 AM Thursday to
  3 AM Friday due to breaking waves up to 20-26 feet.
* More widespread rain on Friday into early Saturday.

As of midnight at the beginning of Wednesday, a storm-force low
located approximately 1000 miles to the west-northwest of San
Francisco, or 850 mi west of Eureka, is bringing a cold front across
the Pacific Northwest into northern and central California. Eureka
radar is starting to pick up the rainband off the coast of northern
California, which is expected to come through the Bay Area and
Central Coast through the day today. The forecast rain total remains
relatively unchanged, with 0.1-0.5" expected for most of the Bay
Area and Central Coast, with higher amounts of 1-2.5" in the North
Bay and the coastal ranges.

For this morning, low temperatures should lie in the low to mid 40s
in the interior with coastal areas seeing lows in the upper 40s to
lower 50s. Strong southerly winds will develop through the day with
the approach of the low squeezing against an upper level ridge
centered on the Great Basin. A Wind Advisory is in effect today for
the North Bay Pacific coast, with gusts as high as 40-50 mph
expected in the area. Elsewhere, gusts will reach up to 20-30 mph. A
Coastal Flood Advisory is also out for the San Francisco Bay
shoreline and the North Bayshore from 9 AM to 1 PM today, with high
astronomical tides with some surge, with a peak at 10:46 AM today.

High temperatures today should be around the upper 50s to mid 60s in
the lower elevations, with low to mid 50s in the higher elevations.
Low temperatures Thursday morning should rise into the upper 40s to
mid 50s, with low to mid 40s in the most interior locations.

.LONG TERM...
(Thursday through Tuesday)
Issued at 1200 AM PST Wed Dec 27 2023

Rain and wind will subside by Thursday morning as the low pressure
system retreats into the Gulf of Alaska, when the focus shifts to
dangerously high surf and coastal flooding. Incoming swell from the
storm force low is expected to be around 20-22 feet high at a 16-18
second period. The staggering amount of energy will result in
breaking waves of 20-30 feet high along west and northwest facing
beaches, with locally higher amounts possible at favored points.
Peak swell is expected to arrive Thursday morning to mid-day. These
high wave heights are very dangerous and will easily sweep people
into the sea off rocks and jetties. Never turn your back to the
ocean! Stay off of coastal jetties, avoid going into and near the
water, and keep your eyes on kids and pets. Coastal flooding is also
a concern with the swell system, combined with high astronomical
tides (near the full moon and the winter solstice), storm surge from
strong southerly winds, and a large wave run-up. A Coastal Flood
Advisory for the Pacific coast is in effect from 9 AM today through
3 AM Friday.

Swell heights will gradually abate later on Thursday but remain
elevated into the weekend. Friday will see a second round of rain,
and unlike the first system, the associated low pressure system is
expected to push out the upper level trough and impact the state.
Thus, higher rain totals are expected with the Friday system.
Current forecast calls for 0.5-1.5" of rain for the interior
portions of the region, and 1.5-3" for the coastal ranges, possibly
up to 4-5" in favored locations. Most of the rain should fall
between Friday morning and Saturday mid-day. Elevated swell also
returns on Saturday, and although wave heights are not expected to
be as high as Thursday, waves up to 20 feet and hazardous conditions
are still possible.

We`re expecting a lull on Sunday (New Year`s Eve) and possible
Monday (New Year`s Day), with a few scattered showers if anything,
before chances of rain tick up the middle of next week. Ensemble
guidance and CPC products collaborate on an active pattern continuing
into the early part of January, but as with all long-term guidance,
rain timing, intensity, and amount are all to be determined.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 352 AM PST Wed Dec 27 2023


Mid-level clouds are building as the next front nears the region.
Some MVFR CIGs will build in the North Bay this morning followed by
increasing southerly winds. Winds aloft in the North bay will be
much stronger than surface winds in the late morning, leading to
LLWS concerns. The strong southerly winds will become widespread in
the afternoon ahead of the main band of rain. Winds weaken as the
rain chances build. Expect some reduction in visibility from moderate
rainfall. Showery conditions linger into the night behind the main
rain band with MVFR and IFR CIGS building as winds weaken into the
late night.


Vicinity of SFO...VFR lasts into the afternoon. Southerly winds
increase in the late morning and look to peak in the afternoon and
evening at around 17 kts and gusts around 30 kts. The stronger winds
arrive within the same hour as the MFVR CIGs and moderate rainfall.
Shower activity continues into early Thursday, but CIGs thin. MVFR
CIGs will return later that morning as winds weaken.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO

Monterey Bay Terminals... Mid-level clouds build in the mid morning
as light winds turn southeasterly and become breezy to gusty.
Showers and scattered low clouds arrive this evening. Winds become
light after the initial rain chances. MVFR CIGs form around the
Monterey Bay in the late night as shower activity persists.

.MARINE...
(Today through Monday)
Issued at 352 AM PST Wed Dec 27 2023

A hurricane-force storm centered about 1000 NM west of the
California/Oregon border will cause marine conditions to
deteriorate through the week. While the worst of the impacts will
stay well offshore, gale force southerly winds with near storm
force gusts will build in the northern outer waters and spread
south through Wednesday. The winds will begin to decrease Thursday
as very high WNW swell arrives. The swell heights will reach
above 20 ft with an average period of 16-18 seconds. Strong
southerly winds return on Friday. Conditions will remain hazardous
for small craft through the weekend.

&&

.BEACHES...
Issued at 353 AM PST Wed Dec 27 2023

A High Surf Warning will go in effect Thursday at 3 AM PST through
3 AM PST Friday. Expect hazardous wave conditions with breaking
waves 25 to 30 feet and localized beach erosion. Large waves can
sweep across the beach without warning, pulling people into the
sea from rocks, jetties and beaches. These large waves can be
erratic and unpredictable. The larger swings of the tidal cycle
will contribute to the beach risks.

Remain out of the water during the High Surf to avoid hazardous
swimming conditions. Use extra caution near the surf zone as
these large waves will be capable of sweeping people into the
water. Avoid rocks and jetties. Avoid steep beaches. Stay much
farther back from the water and never turn your back on the ocean.
