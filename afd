...New AVIATION, MARINE...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 1255 AM PDT Mon Aug 12 2024

Cooling trend continues today, with a slight warmup beginning
Tuesday and temperatures at or below seasonal averages through the
rest of the week.

&&

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 1255 AM PDT Mon Aug 12 2024

Stratus is forming across the coastal valleys, expected to continue
through the late morning. Morning lows remain in the 50s to low 60s
in the valleys, and up to the low 70s in the thermal belts. Inland
highs will continue to decrease today with temperatures in the mid
70s to mid 80s, except up to the upper 90s in the warmest spots of
southern Monterey County. Coastal highs remain in the upper 50s to
mid 60s. Breezy onshore winds will develop this afternoon and
evening with wind gusts up to 25 to 35 miles per hour through the
gaps, passes, and northwest-southeast oriented valleys.

&&

.LONG TERM...
(Tuesday through Sunday)
Issued at 1255 AM PDT Mon Aug 12 2024

A shortwave ridge will cause a bump in inland temperatures on
Tuesday and Wednesday, with temperatures potentially reaching the
upper 80s and the low 90s across the inland valleys. Behind the
ridge, a sharp transition to a troughing pattern will enhance the
breezy and gusty onshore winds, especially through the gaps, passes,
and elevated locations. Ensemble means from the GFS, European, and
Canadian ensembles agree on a ridiculously resilient trough through
the rest of the extended forecast, and CPC outlooks continue to
suggest temperatures at or below the seasonal averages into the last
week of August.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 354 AM PDT Mon Aug 12 2024

A mix of IFR and LIFR CIGs exist this morning as stratus continues
to linger over area terminals. Clearing to VFR is expected in the
late morning today, with winds increasing generally out of the W/NW
for most terminals and becoming breezy. Stratus appears to return
later in the night. With slight troughing aloft, thoughts are that
CIGs will lift to be predominantly MVFR/IFR across the region Monday
night and Tuesday morning, unlike previous nights which saw
predominantly IFR/LIFR CIGs.

Vicinity of SFO...MVFR/borderline IFR CIGs last through at least
sunrise, but will begin to lift as daylight begins and daytime
heating begins. VFR expected to return generally towards the 16-17Z
window. Winds out of the W/NW this afternoon and moderate, with
gusts reaching into the 20 knot range. VFR then expected to last
through the remainder of the TAF period.

SFO Bridge Approach...Low clouds will be present over the Bay waters
through the morning, but should clear just beyond sunrise.

Monterey Bay Terminals...LIFR CIGs will last through the mid
morning, but will likely begin to lift to become IFR just prior to
sunrise. Clearing to VFR in the late morning expected, with winds
increasing out of the NW into the afternoon. Stratus and IFR CIGs
returns in the late night tonight. &&

.MARINE...
(Today through Saturday)
Issued at 354 AM PDT Mon Aug 12 2024

Fresh northwesterly winds continue with coastal jets developing
off of Point Arena and Big Sur. Significant wave heights of 7 feet
begin to abate late Sunday. Moderate northwesterly swell and
light southerly swell continues to move through the waters.
