.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 1141 PM PDT Fri Jul 14 2023

Excessive heat will impact inland areas this weekend with high
temperatures reaching the 90s to around 110. Overnight cooling
will be limited, with a moderate to high HeatRisk for the general
population. Gradual cooling will take place through early to mid
week.

.SHORT TERM...
(Saturday and Sunday)
Issued at 1141 PM PDT Fri Jul 14 2023

Key Messages:
* Dangerous heat this weekend with highs in the 90s to 110 inland
* Limited overnight cooling in the hills with lows of 75 to 85
* Excessive Heat Warning inland areas for Saturday and Sunday
* Low relative humidity values with elevated fire danger

Discussion:
Subtropical ridging will initially locate over central and southern
California through early Sunday before being suppressed southeast in
response to upper troughing approaching NorCal and the Pacific
Northwest. The strong (598 dm) mid-level anticyclone will be coupled
with very warm lower tropospheric temperatures with readings in the
25-30 deg C range at 850 and 925 mb. Heat will be the primary
concern with dangerous heat developing for inland areas. An
Excessive Heat Warning remains in effect for the interior with a
Heat Advisory for the Salinas Valley. High temperatures in the
warning area should climb well into the 90s to around 110 each
afternoon. Onshore flow and a shallow marine layer should save
coastal areas from dangerous heat, with highs generally in the 70-85
degree range. With the marine layer compressing to below 1,000 feet
overnight lows will remain in the 70s to 80s in the hills which will
amplify heat risk concerns given the lack of cooling. Meanwhile
areas closer to the coast should see decent temperature drops
overnight into the 50s and lower 60s. Late night/early morning
clouds, drizzle, and fog should surround the coast and bays, with a
quick retreat of clouds towards the coast during the early to mid
morning hours.

Here are some heat-related safety tips:

* Stay hydrated and cool (use public AC if needed: malls, libraries,
  movie theaters, etc)
* avoid outdoor activities between 1 to 6 pm, including walking your
  pets
* monitor the elderly, young, sick, pets, and livestock for heat
  sensitivity
* double check your vehicles making sure no people or pets are left
  inside while parked in the sun

.LONG TERM...
(Sunday Night through Friday)
Issued at 1232 AM PDT Sat Jul 15 2023

Sunday Night and Monday:

Upper level high pressure will locate over Arizona and New Mexico
while an upper level trough enters NorCal. This will allow southerly
steering flow to develop, with mid to high level moisture drawn
poleward around the western ridge periphery. The moisture is
appreciable for the season, with precipitable water values likely to
reach one inch or greater. A few weak perturbations will also ride
this steering flow with some potential for elevated instability to
couple with the better high level moisture. Should this occur there
may be some potential for high based convection to develop. However
confidence is somewhat low at this time and the official forecast
will carry no precipitation/thunder mention for the moment. At the
very least expect an increase in mid to high level cloud coverage
during this time with a resultant cooling temperature trend.

Tuesday through Friday:

A shortwave trough will progress from the Pacific Northwest along
the International Border with quasi-zonal flow developing
thereafter. This will further erode the northern periphery of the
upper level ridge which will shift more towards the southern Great
Plains. This should bring a gradual cooling trend to the region
through late week as the marine layer deepens and expands farther
inland during the overnight and morning hours.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 420 AM PDT Sat Jul 15 2023

IFR-LIFR conditions in place for most of the coastal and North
Bay terminals this morning. While a ceiling has yet to develop at
KSFO, low clouds are very close to the terminal and expect at
least transient IFR conditions to evolve towards daybreak.
Clearing to VFR at most terminals 15-17Z, although confidence is
lower at KMRY where clouds could hang around longer. Modest
onshore winds expected this afternoon and evening with low clouds
returning tonight. Highest confidence in ceilings developing
around 02-05Z for the Monterey Bay terminals. Lower confidence
around the Bay Area where only a scattered low cloud group was
introduced in the TAF at this time.

Vicinity of SFO...VFR so far at the terminal, although IFR
ceilings are lurking around the terminal. Expect at least a
temporary period of IFR towards daybreak with clearing to IFR
later this morning and afternoon. Winds will be onshore and breezy
this afternoon. Low confidence in ceiling redevelopment over the
terminal tonight but introduced a scattered low cloud group for
the moment.

SFO Bridge Approach...IFR stratus currently expanding from the
South Bay towards the San Mateo Bridge. Expect stratus to linger
in/near the approach through mid morning.

Monterey Bay Terminals...IFR-LIFR in low stratus and occasional
BR/FG this morning. Clearing to VFR most areas by 16-17Z, although
confidence in clearing time is lower at KMRY where low clouds
could linger a bit longer. VFR all terminals this afternoon with
modest onshore winds. Sub-VFR conditions return early to mid
evening and persist overnight.

.MARINE...
(Today through Thursday)
Issued at 111 AM PDT Sat Jul 15 2023

Breezy to locally gusty northwest winds continue over the outer
waters through the weekend, with gale force gusts developing in
the far northern outer waters on Sunday. The SF Bay and Delta
will continue to see breezy conditions each afternoon before winds
diminish into the night. These stronger winds will result in
steep wind waves and hazardous conditions to small craft. Mixed
seas of light northerly and moderate period (8-10 seconds) swell,
and light southerly swell continue through the weekend. Steeper
wind waves expected next week.
