.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 421 AM PDT Fri Apr 12 2024

Cooler and cloudier for Friday as highs fall back into average
range as the next rain-maker nears. Expect a breezy to gusty
afternoon with some light pre-frontal rain, with the main rain
band arriving overnight. Showers and storm chances are expected
through Saturday, with lingering showers Sunday.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 421 AM PDT Fri Apr 12 2024

It`s weather whiplash as the region goes from warm and sunny to cool
and cloudy for the end of the work week.

Temperatures will top off in the 50s and 60s for most areas, with
only a few more interior areas venturing into the 70s, quite the
difference from yesterday.

This cool and cloudy change of pace is due to the trough building
along the west coast, which will have a cold front move through the
Bay Area and Central Coast tonight and the front`s parent low move
through over the weekend.

Southwest winds build ahead of the front this afternoon, along with
some light pre-frontal rain. Winds will be  breezy across the region
but will be particularly gusty on higher peaks in Monterey and San
Benito Counties.

The main rain band arrives along the cold front into the night,
bringing moderate rainfall, with shower activity lasting behind it,
and weakening winds. The most recent forecast updates have delayed
the time of arrival of the cold front, and signal that this could
still be a more late night/early morning set passage.

.LONG TERM...
(Saturday through Thursday)
Issued at 421 AM PDT Fri Apr 12 2024

The weekend will see the cold front`s parent low focusing over the
Bay Area and Central Coast, providing scattered showers and storm
chances through Saturday, with some lingering showers into Sunday.
Storm chances will peak around 25% into Saturday evening and into
the early night, with the focus being off the coast of Santa Cruz Co
and the Monterey Bay.

While the cold front will offer most of the weekend rain fall, the
shower and storm activity behind will add up over time.

As of the current forecast, Rainfall totals from Friday through
Sunday afternoon look to range from:

-0.4" to 0.75" for most inland areas
-0.75" to 1.25" for coastal areas and higher elevations in the North
Bay
-1.25" to 2" Santa Cruz Mtns and the Santa Lucias.
- above 2" for the highest peaks along the Big Sur Coast

A ridge pattern builds in quickly behind the weekend`s rains,
allowing for dry weather to return into next week. This will also
put the region into another warming trend with widespread 60 and 70
degree highs expected in the middle of the work week.
