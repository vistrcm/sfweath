.SHORT TERM...
Issued at 242 AM PST Mon Dec 22 2025
(Today and tonight)

A Flood Watch remains in effect through 4 PM PST for the East Bay
with the overall plan of expanding the Flood Watch in areal coverage
and time on track. The Russian River at Geyserville reached minor
flood stage at 11:30 PM PST 12/21 (39.74 ft) with a Flood Advisory
in effect through 7:15 AM this morning. Minor flooding is likely to
continue in the vicinity of the Russian River between Geyserville
and Jimtown in Sonoma and in the vicinity of Mark West Creek. If you
are driving through the North Bay, be prepared in case you encounter
flooded roadways. Roadway flooding may be hard to see in the dark so
stay aware of your surroundings and if you encounter flooding - Turn
Around, Don`t Drown. Flooding impacts will be exacerbated by the
additional rounds of moderate to heavy rain expected Tuesday through
Friday. Wind impacts will also increase Tuesday with a High Wind
Watch in effect from 7PM PST Tuesday to 4AM PST Wednesday.

Today is a transition day between the first big round of rain
yesterday and the next big round of rain coming in tomorrow. Light
rain will continue across the Bay Area through late tonight as
stationary front lingers over the Bay Area. Rainfall amounts are
expected to decrease with the IVT plume weakening from around 500
kg/ms this morning to around 250 kg/ms by this evening. The main
rain band will remain locked in over the Bay Area today, with minor
oscillations towards the North and South Bays, rain will be more
stratiform within the main rain band with scattered showers on the
periphery of it. This will result in an additional 0.5" of rain
across the interior today. For the coastal mountain ranges (Santa
Cruz Mountains, Mt. Tamalpais), the orientation of this moisture
plume is perpendicular with the coastline which supports increased
orographic uplift. The coastal mountains will see an additional 1-
1.5" today (primarily in the early morning hours when the IVT plume
is the strongest) with locally higher totals possible depending on
where the most orographic uplift is able to occur. Locally breezy
winds peaking around 30 mph are will continue through the late
morning along the coastline, higher elevations, and SF Bay Shoreline
through late morning. Winds will then generally decrease throughout
the afternoon and evening as the surface low progresses eastward. If
you did not finish your outdoor preparations over the weekend or
need to make additional preparations, today is your last chance to
do so before two stronger systems arrive Tuesday into Wednesday and
Wednesday into Thursday. Thunderstorm chances are low today (5-10%).
The ECMWF and HRRR models show around 100 J/kg of MUCAPE across the
South Bay this morning but wind shear in the lowest levels does not
look too supportive of thunderstorm development.

.LONG TERM...
Issued at 242 AM PST Mon Dec 22 2025
(Tuesday through Sunday)

To best address the upcoming weather and associated hazards, the
Long Term discussion will be broken into three parts: Flooding, High
Winds, and Thunderstorms.

Flooding: Tuesday morning, light rain will reintensify to heavy rain
first over the North Bay before extending southwards into the rest
of the Bay Area and Central Coast Tuesday afternoon into Tuesday
evening. The ECMWF continues to show a rapidly intensifying cyclone
meeting bomb cyclone criteria (a drop of 24 millibars or more in 24
hours with some adjustments required depending on the latitude of
the cyclone) moving parallel to the California coastline on Tuesday.
This low pressure system will deepen from around 1000 hPa early
Tuesday morning to 974-975 hPa as it moves up the coastline by early
Wednesday morning. The GFS and Canadian models are starting to catch
up to the ECMWF and are also showing a deepening, strong low
pressure system off the CA coast. At the same time, this system will
bring a renewed transport of moisture into California with IVT
values in excess of 700-800 kg/ms likely. Between Tuesday and early
Wednesday, an additional 1.5-3.5" are expected across the North Bay,
1-3" across the Santa Cruz Mountains, 2-3" across the Santa Lucia
Range and 1-1.5" across the interior Bay Area, Monterey Bay region,
and interior Central Coast. Late Wednesday into Thursday, a second
low pressure system will start to deepen and move northwards
parallel to the CA coast. This system does not deepen as much as the
first system so it is not considered a bomb cyclone. It will bring
another round of widespread moderate to heavy rain and widespread
totals of 2-4" (locally up to 5" in the mountains) between late
Wednesday through Friday. After Friday, rain amounts start to
diminish with light rain to persist into the weekend. In terms of
flooding impacts, flooding impacts will get worse throughout the
week as multiple rounds of moderate to heavy rain occur and soils
saturate. This will result in increased nuisance flooding across
urban areas and see sharp rises in minor streams and creeks. Minor
flooding is likely across at least a few of the mainstream rivers
(such as the Russian River and Napa River in the North Bay) by late
in the week. Anyone who lives in the vicinity of a river or a small
creek known to rise rapidly should pay careful attention to the
forecast and timing of heaviest precipitation. Flooding can often be
hard to see at night so exercise extreme caution when driving at
night. If you see roadway flooding, it cannot be expressed enough
that it is absolutely not safe to drive through. Turn Around, Don`t
Drown is the most important motto for you to remember this week.

High Winds: In addition to heavy rain and flooding concerns, the two
strong systems Tuesday-Wednesday and late Wednesday-Thursday will
result in dangerously strong winds. As the first low pressure system
moves parallel to the coast Tuesday, it will bring a strong low
level coastal jet directly against the Bay Area and Central Coast
coastlines. High resolution models suggests 925 mb winds could be in
excess of 90 knots (103 mph) along our coastline. At the surface,
this will result in gusts to at least 70 mph (potentially higher) as
the main cold front moves through. Winds will be strongest over the
marine environment where storm force to isolated hurricane force
winds are possible. A High Wind Watch, to be upgraded to a High Wind
Warning, is in effect from 7PM PST Tuesday to 4AM PST Wednesday. The
good news is these winds will diminish fairly quickly Wednesday
morning. The bad news is this reprieve will be short lived as winds
strengthen Wednesday evening as the second low pressure system
approaches. Winds looks to be slightly weaker late Wednesday-
Thursday with gusts peaking between 40-60 mph. Right now, everything
is leaning towards a Wind Advisory being necessary for the late
Wednesday-Thursday storm over a second High Wind Warning. The
combination of heavy rain and strong winds will result in trees
falling down and widespread power outages. It will additionally
result in incredibly dangerous conditions to any mariners or anyone
who goes to the beach while high winds are occurring.

Thunderstorms: The final piece of the puzzle is the possibility of
thunderstorms, potentially severe, this week. The potential for
thunderstorms Tuesday into Wednesday and again late Wednesday into
Thursday (all day) has increased from last nights forecast.
Probability of thunderstorms is still between 15-25% but models are
starting to support a more favorable environment for thunderstorm
development with these systems. The most likely scenario would be
for thunderstorms to be embedded within the main rain bands and then
the potential for scattered thunderstorms in the post cold frontal
environment. The SPC has issued a general mention of thunderstorms
for our entire CWA Tuesday into Wednesday. The SPC additionally
issued a marginal risk of severe thunderstorms for the coastal
Central Coast (including the city of Monterey and Big Sur) and a
general mention of thunderstorms for the rest of the CWA Wednesday
into Thursday (Christmas Day). While not in the range of high
resolution models yet, the ECMWF and GFS are both suggesting good
instability (several hundred J/kg of MUCAPE) associated with both
systems, good low level wind shear thanks to the strong winds, and
the cold front acting as a source of lift. Both systems have the
potential for thunderstorms and severe weather but the Wednesday
into Thursday system initially appears to be the most favorable.
Have multiple ways to receive warnings this week in the event that
we see strong thunderstorm development with either system.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 425 AM PST Mon Dec 22 2025

Light to moderate showers continue across the Bay Area, but rain
chances will struggle to reach as far south as the Monterey Bay
until later into the morning. CIGs range from IFR to MVFR north of
SJC while SJC and areas to the south see more mid-level cloud cover.
Showers, and the more consistent rains will be off and on through
the day, with a continued focus on the North Bay, HAF, and the SF
Bay terminals. Winds will mostly stay southerly and range from light
to breezy. Expect more widespread rain with moderate to heavier rain
rates arriving late Tuesday morning and into that afternoon.

Vicinity of SFO...Passing showers will affect visibilities through
the afternoon and into the evening with broken MVFR-level CIGs and
overcast mid-level clouds. Winds look to remain moderate and
southerly through the TAF period. Shower activity becomes spottier
into the evening but re-establishes into the late night. More
persistent rain arrives in the mid morning on Tuesday. Stronger
winds and heavier rains arrive Tuesday afternoon.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...Light showers pass through the Monterey Bay
in the mid morning through the early evening with scattered lower
clouds and overcast mid-level cloud cover. Rain activity pauses
until the late night, but chances still look to to be spotty. Winds
remain  southeasterly at SNS through the TAF period. MRY stays
mostly southeast, but local affects will lead to moments of more
variable wind directions.

&&

.MARINE...
(Today through Saturday)
Issued at 500 AM PST Mon Dec 22 2025

Winds and rain rates subside slightly as the front moves
northward. A significant change takes place Tuesday as a strong
surface low  traverses the waters from the southwest towards the
Northern  California coast. This surface low will undergo rapid
intensification as it approaches the coast Tuesday leading to
nearly widespread gales, with storm-force winds expected along
coastal jets near Point Pigeon and along the Big Sur Coast. There
is a chance for isolated thunderstorms across the waters through
Wednesday before another strong surface low enters the waters late
Wednesday night. Seas build through the week and will be very
hazardous to mariners with the potential for wave heights in
excess of 20 feet.
