.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 135 AM PDT Fri Jun 23 2023

Upper troughing and below normal temperatures will prevail through
early next week. Thereafter temperatures will trend more towards
normal by week`s end as high pressure builds aloft.

&&

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 135 AM PDT Fri Jun 23 2023

A closed upper low initially over the Bay Area this morning will
devolve to an open-wave trough while advancing from the Great Basin
to the northern High Plains. This will allow for a brief period of
quasi-zonal flow today before weak troughing develops across the
northeast Pacific tonight. Given the weak synoptic lift from the
upper low juxtaposed with steady onshore flow (SFO-SAC pressure
gradient ~+3 mb) stratus has blanketed much of the region early this
morning and will gradually clear back towards the coast through the
late morning to early afternoon hours. Areas of drizzle are also
expected in the favorable upslope locations this morning. Look for a
slight warming in temperatures for this afternoon, however readings
will remain below the seasonal averages. Highs will range from 60 to
65 degrees for the immediate coast and bays, with 70s for the
typically warmer inland areas. A few areas in San Benito and/or
southern inland Monterey County may approach the 80 degree mark. For
tonight look for low stratus to spill inland yet again with lows
dipping into the upper 40s to mid 50s.

.LONG TERM...
(Saturday through Friday)
Issued at 135 AM PDT Fri Jun 23 2023

Saturday through Wednesday:

Persistent upper troughing will locate across NorCal bringing
onshore flow, coastal clouds, and below normal temperatures.

Thursday and Friday:

Subtropical Pacific ridging will nudge into the region and connect
with broader ridging located across the southern Great Plains and
northern Mexico. This will bring a warming trend with inland
temperatures climbing back towards seasonal averages. Looking
forward Climate Prediction Center outlooks lean towards above
average temperatures into the first week of July with near normal
precipitation.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 426 AM PDT Fri Jun 23 2023

Cloud deck has lifted gradually overnight and is currently at
around 2500-3200 feet early this morning across terminals. As
such, mix of MVFR and VFR persists across the region. With cloud
decks rising, expecting slightly earlier arrival of VFR
conditions as cigs gradually rise to above 3000 feet. This is
also supported in model guidance. VFR expected between 17-19z
(earlier for SF Bay terminals, later for KMRY/KSNS). Patchy
drizzle will continue through early morning as well, mostly
confined to coastal terrain near KSFO/KOAK. W/SW winds increase
this afternoon, but not expecting gusts as strong as yesterday but
still gusting around 20 knots. High confidence in return of MVFR
cigs overnight tonight, but timing confidence is moderate.

Vicinity of SFO...MVFR cigs persist with gradual rising of cloud
deck heights. VFR expected slightly earlier and was pushed back
to 17z with cloud deck raising to above 3000 feet. Low clouds
completely scatter out by 18-19z. Patchy drizzle possible through
the morning. W/SW winds increase again this afternoon with gusts
up to 25 knots possible. MVFR cigs return overnight. Confidence on
timing is more moderate, but confidence is higher after 07z.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...Cigs are currently borderline MVFR/VFR
right around 3000-3200 feet. VFR expected for KMRY by 19z, but
could be earlier if cigs raise above 3000 feet, so will continue
to monitor. TEMPO included for KSNS for chance of lowering to MVFR
this morning. W/SW winds increase for KMRY this afternoon while
NW winds expected to pick up at KSNS. MVFR cigs return this
evening between 02-04z.

.MARINE...
(Today through Wednesday)
Issued at 207 AM PDT Fri Jun 23 2023

Winds remain generally light to moderately breezy through the day
tomorrow with breeziest conditions over the San Francisco Bay and
the Delta during the afternoon and evening hours. Strong and
gusty northerly winds return late Saturday, becoming widespread
across the waters and will last through much of the upcoming work
week. Longer to moderate period southerly swell continues, with
moderate period northwesterly swell diminishing through the
weekend.
