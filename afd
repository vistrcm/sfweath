.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 208 AM PST Sun Jan 7 2024

Cold mornings are expected to continue through Monday. Cool,
unsettled weather returns midweek with the possibility of them to
continue into the upcoming weekend.

&&

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 208 AM PST Sun Jan 7 2024

Cold temperatures are the main story for this morning as lows dip
into the upper 20s to mid 30s across the interior. Thus, a Frost
Advisory remains in effect for interior areas of the Bay Area and
Central Coast through 10 AM PST. Bayshore and coastal temperatures
are expected to range from the upper 30s to lower 40s.

Afternoon temperatures will struggle to warm above the mid 50s
(upper 30s to mid 40s in the higher elevations). Otherwise, mainly
dry conditions will prevail throughout the day. As winds diminish
tonight, expecting colder temperatures especially across the
interior. Thus, a Freeze Warning is in effect for the interior areas
of the Central Coast with Frost Advisory for interior Bay Area
locations.

&&

.LONG TERM...
(Monday through Saturday)
Issued at 208 AM PST Sun Jan 7 2024

Cool temperatures will prevail on Monday with slight warming by
Tuesday (both morning and afternoon). Unsettled conditions return
Tuesday and Wednesday, mainly across the North Bay as another
frontal system sweeps across the region.

Thursday will be mostly dry with temperatures in the mid/upper 50s
(40s in the region`s higher elevations). Confidence going into
Friday and Saturday remains unclear as both the European and
American models are at odd with one another. The European model (and
Canadian) indicate a weather system will take aim at the Bay Area
suggesting more intense rain, while the American model keeps the
focus on the Pacific Northwest. This uncertainty keeps a 20-35%
chance of rain over much of the forecast area Friday night into
Saturday.
