.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 158 AM PST Fri Jan 26 2024

Warming trend this weekend with near record heat. Cooler and wetter
once again for the middle of next week as the next storm system
approaches.

&&

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 158 AM PST Fri Jan 26 2024

High pressure ridge building over the region today will keep things
on the drier side with what will mostly be a pleasant day.
Afternoon highs right around seasonal normals today with some
cloudiness due to lingering moisture and weak disturbance to the
north fighting the ridge. The ridge mostly wins out through tonight
with slight shower chances trimmed back to only include the northern
portions of Napa/Sonoma counties and the northern waters late Friday
night into Saturday morning.

.LONG TERM...
(Saturday through Thursday)
Issued at 158 AM PST Fri Jan 26 2024

Going into the weekend, things warm up as the ridge overhead builds
further. Sunday and Monday look to be the warmest days of the
forecast period with forecast highs 10 to 15 degrees above normal.
Sunday in particular is expected to be the warmest with many
locations seeing temps in the upper 60s to lower 70s. Records and
forecast temps are noted in the CLIMATE section below. A bit
cooler along the coast, but still in the 60s. Portions of the
southern Salinas valley even have a low chance (~10%) of hitting
80 on Sunday. A bit cooler Monday and back down to seasonal norms
going into Tuesday as the next deep trough approaches.

Big changes expected as we get into Tuesday/Wednesday. A robust
Pacific jet extends into the West Coast with a robust and well-
established moisture tap into the sub-tropics. This marks the
beginning of an active period for our area going into the next 7-10
days. Despite the strong moisture advection associated with this
system, it appears to be associated with a more transient upper
trough and associated surface low. The 150+ kt Pacific jet just
upstream of the base of the trough gives a further hint that this
will be more of a fairly quick hitter as this would promote the
trough to rapidly dig to the southeast. One thing of note in this
case, the soils are at critical levels, especially after the last
storm cycle, and any additional heavy rainfall will result in rapid
runoff into creeks and streams. The good news is that our rivers are
doing well and have a wealth of capacity to accept rapid runoff.

To reiterate: We still DO NOT see any indication that next week`s
system will cause major or devastating flooding. Main stem rivers
have a low chance of reaching flood stage. The most likely impacts
at this point in the forecast would be rapid rises in feeder creeks
and streams, minor urban flooding, shallow landslides along unstable
and steep slopes, and roadway flooding. With this event still being
5-6 days out, stay tuned to the forecast for the latest updates.
