...New AVIATION...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 321 AM PDT Tue Sep 19 2023

Mild weather with near normal temperatures through mid week. A
weather system passing to our east may bring some light offshore
winds to the North and East bay hills on Wednesday into Thursday.
Small chance for light rain in the North Bay by early to mid next
week.

&&

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 321 AM PDT Tue Sep 19 2023

The upper pattern will feature a low pressure area progressing from
the eastern Pacific into SoCal while upstream troughing drops from
southwest Canada into the central Great Basin. An associated surface
cold front should reach the North Bay tonight before gradually
washing out. Marine layer clouds have been disrupted over the past
24 hours, with early morning satellite imagery showing only patchy
stratus development over portions of the Oakland hills, San Mateo
coast, and over central portions of Monterey Bay. Do expect a little
overnight expansion towards morning, but overall this looks like
another day where many areas see more sunshine, even during the
morning hours. Highs will be seasonal and range from the upper 60s
to mid 70s for the coast and bays, with 70s to mid 80s for the
warmer inland spots. Lows tonight will drop into the 50s.

.LONG TERM...
(Wednesday through Monday)
Issued at 321 AM PDT Tue Sep 19 2023

An expansive upper low pressure area will drop into the Great Basin
by mid to late week with transient shortwave ridging taking hold
thereafter. Troughing looks to return by early to mid next week.
Given the onshore trajectory of the upper low, look for a bout of
weak northerly (offshore) winds in the North Bay hills on Wednesday
night. This will bring some drying at elevation but at the moment
peak gusts don`t appear overly impressive. However high elevation
spots like Mt St Helena may still see some 20-30 mph gusts and
lowering humidities. Temperatures should remain seasonal through
the weekend, with a slight warming trend anticipated for early
next week. Looking towards mid week, a weakening cold front looks
to approach the region. This may bring a small chance for light
rain to the North Bay on Tuesday or Wednesday. Global models and
their ensembles differ on timing at the moment so stay tuned for
updates.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 444 AM PDT Tue Sep 19 2023

MVFR CIGs in SFO and OAK. VLIFR CIG in MRY, and VLIFR VIS in STS.
APC will likely develop an IFR CIG in the next 90 minutes and the
current satellite loop shows encroaching coastal stratus that
supports this timeline. The remainder of the terminals are
expected to remain in VFR conditions this morning. Widespread
clearing is expected by 18-19Z before moderate westerly winds
develop in the afternoon.

Vicinity of SFO... SFO and OAK are both MVFR at the moment,
however they are reporting multiple cloud layers with bases
hovering around the IFR threshold of 1,000 ft. As such, a tempo
line was added to the TAFs to account for any temporary drop in
flight category. By mid-morning, the ceilings should remain MVFR
before breaking in the late-morning. Expect moderate westerly
winds this afternoon in the 10-14 kt range.

SFO Bridge Approach... Current satellite imagery suggests the
bridge approach is in a clear window, but that may be closing
soon. Otherwise, expect a similar trend to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals... MRY is reporting a very low ceiling of
100 ft, which just dropped to mist with 1 1/2 mi VIS. The TAF
includes a TEMPO line accounting for VIS down to 1 mi through 16Z.
This low ceiling was a little surprising as the Ft. Ord profiler
suggests the marine layer is very diffuse. There may be a surface
based inversion that`s actually shallower than the 170 ft
elevation of the instrument. The WRF model sounding for MRY and
observed ceiling height support this hypothesis. Either way, it
shouldn`t take long for VIS to improve after sunrise. Expecting a
VFR afternoon with an early return of MVFR stratus this evening.
SNS still has clear skies this morning, and the TAF suggests VFR
all day. The short term SNS forecast is rather uncertain, however,
as stratus is beginning to form on either end of the Salinas
Valley this morning. If a CIG develops, it will likely have an
base in the IFR range. SNS has a much better chance of ceilings
tomorrow morning.

.MARINE...
(Today through Sunday)
Issued at 359 AM PDT Tue Sep 19 2023

Northerly winds increase across the northern outer waters
tonight, spreading south and becoming increasingly gusty through
week`s end. This will result in rough seas over the northern outer
waters beginning on Tuesday. Light southerly swell and moderate
northwesterly swell will continue today before a longer period
northwesterly swell train arrives Tuesday morning.

&&

.FIRE WEATHER...
Issued at 103 PM PDT Mon Sep 18 2023

As low pressure moves out of the region from west to east on
Wednesday, it will set up a short window for some offshore winds
early AM hours on Thursday. Models have been waffling with this
one for days now and seem to be coming into better and more
consistent alignment. As such, we are watching for some weak
offshore winds to develop over the North Bay Mountains and East
Bay Hills. At this time, the peak area should be over Northeast
Napa County. Will this spread to the Mayacamas? Yes, but not with
the same magnitude. For now, plan for N-NE winds GUSTS over the
Vaca Range and Mayacamas in the 20-30 mph range. It will be a
short lived window from about midnight Wednesday through 8 am
Thursday. The two pluses are, relative humidity will remain high
due to the onshore winds prior to this weak event and the ERCs are
seasonable if not more moist that seasonable. At this time we do
not have a fire weather watch or red flag out. We`ll keep a close
eye on this as the models congeal on a solution.
