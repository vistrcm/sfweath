VFR through the TAF period for most terminals, with the exception of
Monterey Bay. Rain has ceased for most terminals, with just a few
showers in the vicinity of KMRY and KSNS. Expect breezy
northwesterly winds today in the afternoon, reaching up to about
13 knots for coastal terminals. Into the nighttime hours, winds
ease and become more variable and light.


Vicinity of SFO...VFR through the TAF period. Current light winds
will increase through the day to become breezy around 13 knots out
of the NW. Into the late night, winds diminish and become light and
variable. A few low clouds may develop over the terminal in the
early hours of Friday, though confidence on the development of any
CIGs at this time is low.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...MVFR conditions are expected to improve to
VFR into the mid morning as the final showers in the vicinity begin
to push out. However, the VFR break appears to only last until the
early afternoon, as model consensus shows BKN CIGs developing in the
afternoon as low clouds make their way through the region. However,
confidence on this is only moderate. A return to VFR is expected
into the nighttime hours tonight for KMRY as low clouds move out.
Winds this morning are moderate at KSNS out of the SE, though winds
for the terminal will become more onshore into the afternoon today
and breezy. A return to SE drainage winds is likely for KSNS into
the early morning of Friday.
