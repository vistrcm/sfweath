...New AVIATION, MARINE...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 1211 AM PDT Sat Jun 24 2023

Upper troughing and below normal temperatures will prevail through
early next week. Thereafter temperatures will trend more towards
normal by week`s end as high pressure builds aloft.

&&

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 1211 AM PDT Sat Jun 24 2023

The large-scale pattern is a familiar one. Upper troughing will
locate from the Pacific Northwest through the eastern Pacific while
expansive upper ridging will center over northeast Mexico and
southwest Texas. Southwest flow will prevail aloft with a basal jet
bringing some high-level clouds to the region. This pattern will
maintain steady onshore flow (SFO-SAC pressure gradient averaging 2-
3 MB early this morning) with a relatively deep marine layer and
breezy conditions this afternoon through the favorable coastal gaps
and valleys. Low stratus blanketing areas near the coast and bays
will begin mixing out later this morning with a gradual clearing
towards the coast by early afternoon. Expect an early return of low
clouds this evening for many of the same spots. Temperatures will
remain on the cool side of climatology, with highs generally in the
60s along the coast and within the marine influenced valleys. Inland
readings will mostly be in the lower 70s, except nearing 80 across
far southern Monterey County and far northeast Napa County.

.LONG TERM...
(Sunday through Friday)
Issued at 1211 AM PDT Sat Jun 24 2023

Troughing will remain in the vicinity of NorCal through mid week.
This will bring onshore flow, coastal clouds, and a continuation of
below normal temperatures.

A pattern change will finally occur towards the latter portion of
next week. The aforementioned high pressure area over the
southern Great Plains will expand and connect with subtropical
ridging across the eastern Pacific. This will begin a warming
trend with temperatures climbing back towards seasonal averages.
Looking forward, model ensembles and WPC cluster analysis suggest
a trend towards ridging over the interior west into early July.
The Climate Prediction Center 6-10 and 8-14 day temperature
outlooks lean towards above normal temperatures across the region
heading into early next month.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 421 AM PDT Sat Jun 24 2023

Mix of MVFR and IFR (localized LIFR at KSTS) early this morning.
Low clouds will likely linger through the late morning/early
afternoon again today with clearing times between 18z and 20z. For
terminals currently under IFR cigs, conditions will improve to
MVFR before scattering out later this morning. W/SW winds
continue through the TAF period across all terminals, becoming
breezy during the afternoon. MVFR cigs will make an early return
this evening, first arriving to Monterey Bay terminals around
01-02z, then SF Bay terminals as early as 04z, but moderate
confidence exists currently regarding timing.

Vicinity of SFO...MVFR cigs prevail through the early afternoon.
West winds continue through the taf period, increasing this
afternoon with gusts up to 24 knots possible. MVFR cigs will
return this evening and will persist through the overnight hours
tonight. Still will have to fine tune timing of stratus arrival,
as there is moderate confidence for 04z arrival.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...MVFR cigs will persist into the late
morning/early afternoon. Borderline IFR cigs at KMRY, so tempo
included for possibility of cigs lowering to IFR. Onshore winds
will become breezy this afternoon before diminishing tonight. MVFR
cigs return as early as 01-02z today.

.MARINE...
(Today through Thursday)
Issued at 208 AM PDT Sat Jun 24 2023

Northerly to northwesterly winds continue to be breezy along the
Big Sur Coast. Gusty winds will spread to much of the coastline by
tomorrow afternoon, eventually spreading to the outer waters
Sunday into Monday. Breezy to gusty northerly winds will persist
across the waters through much of the upcoming work week. Moderate
period southerly swell continues, with moderate period
northwesterly swell diminishing through the weekend.
