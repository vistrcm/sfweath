.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 310 AM PDT Sat Jul 22 2023

Heat Advisories will remain in effect through Saturday evening.
Dense fog will be possible through the early morning hours. Cool
conditions remain along the coast with hazardous heat expected in
the interior today. A gradual cool down for the inland areas will
begin on Sunday, and continue through the first part of the work
week.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 310 AM PDT Sat Jul 22 2023

Fog is struggling to form along the coast but visibilities are
bringing to reduce near Half Moon Bay. An eddy forming in the
Monterey Bay seems to be hampering the formation of fog and low
clouds around the Monterey Bay, but this will be something the crew
keeps an eye on through the morning. A Dense Fog Advisory is in
affect for the San Mateo Coast, Northern Salinas Valley, Carmel
Valley, Monterey Bay, and Big Sur Coast until 10am.

Speaking of advisories, the Heat Advisory continues for the North
Bay interior mountains, the East Bay hills and valleys, central and
eastern Santa Clara Country, as well as the interior Central Coast
until 11 pm. The overnight forecast package added a few adjustments
to the more interior area temperatures, but the forecast overall
remains on track. Highs were increased for the higher elevations in
the interior areas that still have failed to cool below the 80s
overnight.

Otherwise expect similar conditions to yesterday:

Coastal areas sticking to the 60s and 70s

The areas within the Heat Adv warming 90s and into the triple-digits.

Some of the hottest areas nearing 110 degrees.

.LONG TERM...
(Sunday through Friday)
Issued at 310 AM PDT Sat Jul 22 2023

Expect improved relief from the heat Saturday night as the pattern
begins to change. The high pressure exits leading to zonal flow
followed by slight troughing into Sunday. This will lead to a
notably cooler night for interior areas followed by a Sunday that is
much closer to average for most areas. Monday continues the cooling
trend with mostly average highs and lows.

Don`t expect much in the way of variety in highs and lows after
Monday. The steady flow from the upper level pattern keeps
temperatures close to average for the remainder of the week and into
the weekend. Longer term models and ensemble members continue to
agree that this trend cloud last into early August.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 431 AM PDT Sat Jul 22 2023

VFR condition continue to prevail for all terminals north of
Monterey Bay with high confidence that VFR conditions will continue
through the TAF period for those terminals. Some terminals may
experience some haze during this morning due to the wildfire smoke
from Oregon but no impacts to flight categories. As the marine layer
remains compressed, chances of fog and low cigs is possible near the
coast this morning, especially near Monterey Bay terminals. Light to
moderate onshore winds will increase in the afternoon with winds
reaching up to 15 knots.

Vicinity of SFO...VFR conditions are expected to prevail through the
TAF period. Currently, onshore winds are up to 16 knots, with
expectations that winds will become gusty near the afternoon up to
25 knots.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...Mix of VFR and LIFR conditions as KSNS is
experiencing some clearing earlier than expected. KMRY is expected
to see some lifting near 19Z, but exact timing on clearing is a bit
uncertain. W/NW winds are expected to remain relatively light to
moderate through the TAF period for KMRY, as KSNS will experience
breezy winds through the Salinas Valley up to 12 knots.

.MARINE...
(Today through Thursday)
Issued at 310 AM PDT Sat Jul 22 2023

hazardous conditions for small craft operators through the

Visibility reductions in dense fog are likely, especially during
the overnight and early morning hours.
