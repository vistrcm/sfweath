...New AVIATION, MARINE...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 226 AM PDT Thu Aug 8 2024

Hot temperatures continue for the inland Central Coast, gradually
cooling off elsewhere over the next several days. More substantial
cooldown towards the end of the weekend into early next week.

&&

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 226 AM PDT Thu Aug 8 2024

Cooler temps across the board this morning compared to 24 hours
ago. This is due in part to a deeper marine layer (about 1,000-1,400
feet as of writing). 500 mb heights basically hold steady today
keeping temps on the warmer side for interior areas of the Central
Coast. However, better onshore flow and starting the day with
some high clouds due to tropical moisture will keep areas from the
Bay Area northward a few degrees cooler today.

&&

.LONG TERM...
(Friday through Wednesday)
Issued at 226 AM PDT Thu Aug 8 2024

Friday is expected to be pretty similar to today as the ridge
hangs around a little longer. Really no notable change from today
through Saturday except for the high clouds no longer being around
as the tropical moisture exits. Afternoons are likely to be on the
breezy side beginning Friday through the weekend with northwest
gusts to 25-30 mph near gaps and passes. More substantial cooldown
by the end of the weekend and early next week. Longer term pattern
still supports below normal temperatures in the 7-14 day period.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 448 AM PDT Thu Aug 8 2024

Increasing atmospheric moisture is causing marine layer stratus
and high clouds to roll in this morning. The typical stations will
be in IFR-LIFR ceilings until late morning. Inland stations will
likely remain VFR under increasing high cloud coverage. Moderate
to strong onshore winds will develop by the afternoon. Stratus
will return Thursday night with a similar coverage pattern as
this morning, but with an earlier onset and longer duration.

Vicinity of SFO...The short term forecast is quite uncertain as
high clouds are obstructing the satellite view of stratus in the
Bay. OAK is currently OVC007, while SFO only has FEW004. The best
chance for these clouds to reach SFO is between 13-16 UTC, but the
confidence very low, and the TAF has a tempo line to account for
this possibility. Stratus clearing in the late morning, strong
onshore winds in the afternoon, stratus returns earlier tonight.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO

Monterey Bay Terminals...LIFR conditions will persist for both MRY
and SNS this morning, with a few hours of clearing expected in
the afternoon. Overall not a great day for VFR pilots around the
Monterey Bay today.

&&

.MARINE...
(Today through Tuesday)
Issued at 448 AM PDT Thu Aug 8 2024

The gradient between subtropical high pressure and lower pressure
over California will tighten over the next couple days,
increasing winds to a fresh to strong NW breeze. These winds will
build rough seas over the outer waters.
