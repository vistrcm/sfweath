...New UPDATE...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 146 AM PDT Sun Aug 25 2024

A high pressure system moves in from the west resulting in a warming
trend beginning today. Dry and warmer to hotter weather prevailing
early to mid week then a slight cooling trend develops late in the
week.

&&

.UPDATE...
Issued at 850 AM PDT Sun Aug 25 2024

Forecast remains on track for mostly sunny skies today across our
area, as a warming trend that peaks midweek sets in. Inland
locations may see moderate heat risk Tuesday and Wednesday.

&&

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 235 AM PDT Sun Aug 25 2024

A few areas of low clouds and fog are developing along the coast
per satellite imagery. A high pressure system is otherwise moving
in from the west which will result in a warming trend beginning
today. Expect dry weather (and less mugginess) across the forecast
area with daytime highs in the 70s, 80s to near 90F coolest coast
and bayside to warmest/hottest far inland - near to slightly
below late August (1991-2020) normals. The overall precipitable
water is already on the decline across the Bay Area and north
Central Coast since the eastward departure of the low. Recent NAM
model output is showing lowering surface dewpoint temperatures
(decreasing water vapor) as well through morning and the rest of
today. Overall it should turn out nice today, please be careful
though to limit time in the August sun if planning to be outdoors.
For tonight, ongoing drier air at the surface and aloft will
allow for good radiational cooling with lows in the 50s to around
60 lower elevations while it`ll be a little milder in the hills
and mountains with the redevelopment of a lower level temperature
inversion beneath the 500 mb ridge.

&&

.LONG TERM...
(Monday through Saturday)
Issued at 235 AM PDT Sun Aug 25 2024

The 500 mb high pressure ridge strengthens further Monday-Tuesday
with geopotential heights peaking near 592 decameters during this
time; typically per late August Oakland upper air soundings it`s
585 decameters, the 90th percentile is 591 decameters. Compressional
warming further strengthens the lower level temperature inversion
early to mid week assisting daytime highs to climb to the 90s and
possibly near 100F far inland with 80s and 70s back nearest the
coast and bays with at least partial marine influence and afternoon
sea breezes. Moderate HeatRisks will be developing for parts of
our interior forecast area early to mid week, peaking Tuesday and
Wednesday (it`s borderline criteria for issuing a heat advisory -
will wait for now and reassess at a later time).

The 500 mb ridge may weaken here later in the week since the
polar jet stream and 500 mb short wave troughs is in a progressive
pattern across the North Pacific and northern CONUS/Canada. The
polar jet with a 500 mb trough over the Gulf of Alaska deposits
weak polar jet stream winds approx 1000 miles to our west tonight
and Monday these winds will steadily merge with the subtropical
jet stream that reaches our forecast area Saturday. The development
of this merger energy essentially occurs nearest the subtropical
ridge thus e.g. 700-500 mb layer humidity is dry and global models
show it remaining dry upon forecast arrival here Saturday thus it`s
not favorable for either wet weather and/or convection. However,
the synoptic pattern may help ease area daytime temperatures late
in the week and weekend for example per recent statistical guidance.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 442 AM PDT Sun Aug 25 2024

Good day for VFR pilots to get in the air. While there is some
persistent stratus off the coast of San Mateo impacting HAF, it
has not, and likely will not, affect the TAF sites today. The only
real concern is moderate to strong onshore wind in the afternoon
at several terminals. By tonight, the marine layer should start to
become reestablished and the usual Summer stratus will likely
return by Monday morning.

Vicinity of SFO...VFR through the TAF period. The guidance has
finally given up on developing any ceiling this morning. There has
been a trend for stronger winds this afternoon, however, with SFO
expected to gust into the mid 20s for a couple hours. By Monday
morning, MVFR stratus may return (40-50% chance).

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...A rare VFR day is possible at the
Monterey Bay TAF sites, although there is a thin patch of IFR
clouds over the Bay and impacting OAR. It`s possible MRY or SNS
get caught by this cloud layer for a couple hours this morning.
The winds may swirl a bit at SNS before settling into onshore flow
by late morning. GFSLAMP shows a 70% chance of MVFR ceilings at
MRY by this time Monday morning so the forecast confidence is
actually higher tomorrow morning.

.MARINE...
(Today through Friday)
Issued at 442 AM PDT Sun Aug 25 2024

Gentle to moderate northwesterly winds continue through the
weekend. Stronger wind gusts are expected to develop Sunday
afternoon into the evening along the Big Sur Coast and within the
San Francisco and Monterey Bays with small craft advisories in
effect for this timeframe. Widespread moderate to fresh
northwesterly winds return over the outer coastal waters during
the early week. Winds will strengthen further and seas will
become rough by the middle of next week over the northern outer
waters. Long period southerly swell will arrive from distant
hurricanes by late week.

.MTR WATCHES/WARNINGS/ADVISORIES...
CA...None.
PZ...Small Craft Advisory from 3 PM this afternoon to 9 PM PDT this
     evening for Mry Bay-Pigeon Pt to Pt Pinos 0-10 nm.

     Small Craft Advisory from 3 PM to 9 PM PDT Monday for Pigeon Pt
     to Pt Pinos 0-10 nm.

     Small Craft Advisory from 3 PM this afternoon to 3 AM PDT Monday
     for Pt Pinos to Pt Piedras Blancas 0-10 nm.

     Small Craft Advisory from 3 PM this afternoon to 9 AM PDT
     Tuesday for Pt Arena to Pt Reyes 10-60 NM.

     Small Craft Advisory from 3 PM Monday to 9 AM PDT Tuesday for
     Pigeon Pt to Pt Pinos 10-60 NM.
