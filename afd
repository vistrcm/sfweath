.SHORT TERM...
Issued at 220 AM PST Tue Feb 3 2026
(Today and tonight)

Another day of warm and dry conditions today as high pressure
builds overhead. Temperatures this morning will start out cool
once again, mainly in the 40s, thanks to mostly clear skies across
the area. Patchy fog in the North and East Bay valleys as well as
the southern Salinas Valley will quickly dissipate after sunrise.
Light offshore winds this afternoon will boost the warming
provided by the ridge and mostly sunny skies, with highs up to 5
degrees warmer than Monday. This will place high temperatures
around 5 to 15 degrees above seasonal normals, with mid 60s to
lower 70s near the coast and 70s to near 80 inland. Conditions
tonight will be very similar to this morning, with lows a couple
degrees higher and patchy fog expected in the same general areas.

.LONG TERM...
Issued at 220 AM PST Tue Feb 3 2026
(Wednesday through Monday)

The warmest day of the period at most locations will be Wednesday
as the ridge reaches peak strength and begins to shift east,
allowing offshore winds to tick up. This will push highs up a few
more degrees from today. On Thursday, highs should cool slightly
as the ridge continues to move away. On Friday and Saturday, a
weak low will move near the coast and into southern California.
Impacts will be minimal, but clouds will increase and winds will
turn onshore, continuing the cooling trend.

A more significant pattern change will take place Sunday and
Monday as a deeper trough moves into the Pacific Northwest. This
will bring potential for light precipitation and a cold front as
the trough progresses. Latest ensemble guidance has delayed the
onset of precipitation, but chances increase increase from north
to south through the day Sunday. The chance of rain rises above 20
percent by Sunday morning across the North Bay, Sunday afternoon
for the greater SF Bay area, and Sunday evening for the Central
Coast. Rain chances continue at around 20 to 40 percent into
Monday. As our area remains on the southern fringe of this system,
rain amounts are trending light and low impact overall. However,
temperatures will cool to near or even slightly below normal, and
winds may become locally breezy.
