.SHORT TERM...
Issued at 303 AM PST Fri Feb 20 2026
(Today and tonight)

Isolated rain showers continue across the marine zones and Central
Coast with the help of surface troughing. These rain showers will be
unimpactful and are expected to wane by sunrise. It is going to be a
cold start to the morning, so be sure to grab some extra layers on
your way out the door! The 00Z sounding observed an 850 millibar
temperature of -1.75 degrees Celsius which is below the tenth
percentile (-0.5 degrees Celsius) for the date and time. While it is
going to be cold, we are not expecting any records to be tied or
broken. Probably of more interest (and relief) in the short term is
that it is going to be dry as high pressure noses in from the
Eastern Pacific Ocean. Maximum temperatures will warm to 10 degrees
below normal today with another cold night on tap. Precautions
should be taken to protect people, pets, and plants.

.LONG TERM...
Issued at 303 AM PST Fri Feb 20 2026
(Saturday through Thursday)

Unsettled weather will return this weekend as the region gets
skirted by a couple passing low pressure systems in the Pacific
Northwest. Light rain showers will return to the North Bay Saturday
morning with drizzle possible for locations farther south. More
impactful will be the wind with southerly gusts up to 45 mph
possible along the coast and in the higher terrain. Probabilities
are low to moderate (less than 50% chance) and are across a small
area, thus a Wind Advisory is not warranted at this time. The
weekend will be your best bet to clean up any damage that occurred
this week and prepare for next week`s weather. Global ensemble
clusters are in agreement of upper-level ridging across the
Intermountain West and upper-level troughing off the Pacific
Northwest Coast with heights rising at least through Monday. Another
developing surface low pressure system off the Pacific Northwest
will source moisture from the tropics with ECMWF and GEFS IVT
ensemble mean peaking near 500 kg/ms by Tuesday. Southwesterly flow
(from the tropics) will allow for efficient rainfall due to the
fetch of moist, warm air. As a result, southwest facing terrain will
have the highest accumulation with the help of orographic lift with
the lee side valleys experiencing the rain shadow effect.
Fortunately, the trend has been our friend with all of the above
systems trending farther north between forecasts which will allow
for a reprieve between the deluge that we have experienced the past
week. As the forecast looks right now, the Monday into Tuesday
system will bring widespread rainfall. Minor flooding of low-lying,
poor drainage, and urban areas will be possible with ponding and
slick roadways a guarantee. Mainstem river flooding is not expected
with a low probability (less than 20%) of occurrence.
