...New SYNOPSIS, SHORT TERM, LONG TERM, AVIATION, MARINE...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 343 AM PST Thu Feb 27 2025

Warm again today with clouds encroaching due to a cut off low
nearing the SoCal coast. Cooler temps for the rest of the week and
light rain chances by late Saturday. Beneficial rain amounts
expected, minimal flooding concerns (if any). Active pattern
remains through next week with additional rain chances.

&&

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 343 AM PST Thu Feb 27 2025

Current satellite showing scattered high clouds rolling in from the
west as a cut off low approaches the southern CA coast. Not really
expecting much from this system aside from scattered high cloudiness
throughout the day today. Weak warm air advection will help keep
high temperatures above normal again today, but a few locations may
struggle to reach their forecasted temps should the high clouds be
more persistent than expected. This is especially true along the
immediate coast where some marine influence will play a role in
moderating temps as well. Otherwise, looking like another beautiful
day in the Bay Area and Central Coast!

.LONG TERM...
(Friday through Wednesday)
Issued at 343 AM PST Thu Feb 27 2025

The Gulf of Alaska low remains active, from which a more transient
low with a stronger moisture tap translates towards the West Coast
by Saturday. This will bring widespread rain chances to the region
overnight Saturday, and most will likely wake up Sunday morning with
at least some rain. Again, this will be a rather transient system
as the jet stream flow remains amplified with high amplitude
ridges up and downstream of the trough. Rain chances decrease by
Monday as the low moves inland. Rainfall totals are expected to be
modest, with generally up to 0.5 to 0.75" along the coastal
ranges, and a few tenths inland. Rainshadowed areas of the South
Bay, far interior East Bay, and the southern Salinas Valley may be
hard pressed to see 0.1". All in all this pattern kind of
persists into the middle of next week with another system entering
the picture by Tuesday. Much more uncertainty at this point
regarding how impactful the rainfall may or may not be next week,
but there is moderate confidence in saying that there will be a
change in the sensible weather, and some locations along the West
Coast will have a rainy week ahead. The good news in terms of
impacts; the pattern remains progressive, and we don`t see any
sign any stalling systems or prolonged heavy rain between now and
the middle of next week.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 343 AM PST Thu Feb 27 2025

Widespread VFR lasts through the day and well into the night. Mostly
light winds are expected into the late morning and early afternoon
before more moderate winds arrive. Localized affects will determine
wind directions, so expect some variability between TAF sites.
Winds become light and variable for most areas into the night.
MVFR/IFR CIGs build along the coast late Thursday night and move
inland into early Friday.

Vicinity of SFO...VFR through the TAF period. Light and variable
winds linger into the mid afternoon before turning more westerly and
becoming more moderate. Expect winds to become light and variable
again into the night.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...VFR lasts into early Friday. Light to
moderate southeast winds last into the afternoon before moderate
west winds build. THese winds linger into the night before they
become light and variable. MVFR CIGS fill into early Friday.

.MARINE...
(Today through Tuesday)
Issued at 343 AM PST Thu Feb 27 2025

Light to moderate winds continue over the coastal waters through

Rain likely this weekend into the work week.
