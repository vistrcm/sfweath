...New UPDATE, MARINE, FIRE WEATHER...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 151 AM PDT Sat Oct 5 2024

Heat peaks again today and tomorrow with widespread moderate-to-
major Heat Risk. Excessive Heat Warnings and Heat Advisories have
been extended to Sunday. Some relief is still on tap for next
week.

&&

.UPDATE...
Issued at 828 AM PDT Sat Oct 5 2024

Temperatures are running several to as much as 25 degrees warmer
than 24 hours ago. As such, expecting another hot day across the
region with temperatures reaching up to 105 degrees in the interior
and 95 degrees closer to the coast. However, there is likely to be a
very large temperature gradient from the immediate coastline to just
a few miles inland. Heat products go into effect at 10 AM this
morning for coastal areas and remain in effect through 11 PM Sunday
evening for the remainder of the region.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 151 AM PDT Sat Oct 5 2024

Quite close to a deja vu night currently, sans nocturnal drying.
Current radar and satellite are showing some returns of elevated
showers over the waters and the North Bay, courtesy of some
lingering subtropical moisture around 10,000 feet. None of which
is likely to make it to the ground given how dry the sub-cloud
layer is. There are also some hints of a southerly surge of
marine stratus along the Big Sur coast, currently being held up by
very light offshore winds around the Monterey Bay. Shouldn`t be
too impactful for our forecast high temps today, but we`ll need to
watch that this morning and potentially adjust for the Santa Cruz
coastline. Otherwise, heat hazards have been extended to 11 PM
Sunday, with the exception of the Heat Advisory along the coast,
and the Excessive Heat Warning for San Francisco, both of which
are set to expire at 11 PM tonight. No changes to the Red Flag
Warning set to expire at 9 AM this morning, although near critical
fire weather conditions persist today given the hot and dry
conditions.

A few interesting climate stats:

- If San Jose Airport hits 100 today, it will be the most days
  with a high of at least 100 in a calendar year on record.
  Currently tied the record, which is 5 days at or above 100
  (occurred in several past years).

- Santa Rosa Co-op station has broken the record for the most days
  above 100 in a calendar year with 12 days so far. Old record
  was 11 days in 1976 and 1917.

- San Rafael has broken the record for most days above 100 in a
  calendar year with 10 days so far. Old record was 8 days in
  1976.

.LONG TERM...
(Sunday through Friday)
Issued at 151 AM PDT Sat Oct 5 2024

Sunday looks like another very warm day across the interior. There
does appear to be some relief to coastal and low-lying coastal
adjacent areas given that the bulk of the low-level flow promotes
turning back to persistent onshore. The onshore flow paired with
falling 500 mb heights will be the beginning of the end of this
heatwave. By Monday morning, strong northwest winds develop in a
coastal jet ahead of an approaching upper level trough. The marine
layer is expected to deepen into Tuesday, bringing much welcome
relief across a much broader swath of the region. For the latter
half of the week, guidance continues to advertise a deep trough
swinging into the PNW and grazing northern and central California.
Ultimately, this would bring some sense of rainfall to the
region, but don`t hold your breath. While ensemble members have
been consistent with showing this, they`ve also been consistent in
that not very many members are on board. Therefore, the chance
still remains very low that we see measurable rain by the end of
next week in the North Bay.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 424 AM PDT Sat Oct 5 2024

VFR through the TAF period for all but the Monterey Bay. Dry
conditions will limit cloud cover for all but the most immediate
coast until late Saturday night. Expect light and variable winds
through Saturday morning with more moderate winds expected into
the afternoon, but becoming light again into the mid evening and
early night.

Vicinity of SFO...VFR through the TAF period. Winds stay light
through the night and the morning before increasing to around 12 kts
in the mid afternoon before becoming light again Saturday night.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...VFR through the late night. Expect light
and variable winds through the night but winds become moderate in
the late morning. Winds become light again Saturday night. LIFR
CIGs will slowly move into the area late Saturday night, filling
over the terminals.

&&

.MARINE...
(Today through Thursday)
Issued at 828 AM PDT Sat Oct 5 2024

Gentle to moderate northerly winds will prevail through Monday.
As the pressure gradient tightens Tuesday, northwesterly breezes
increase to become moderate to fresh and seas become rough in the
outer waters. As hot conditions persist and people flock to the
coast, always remember to wear a life jacket, swim near a
lifeguard, and never turn your back on the ocean.

&&

.FIRE WEATHER...
Issued at 828 AM PDT Sat Oct 5 2024

The Red Flag Warning will be allowed to expire at 9 AM this morning
as wind speeds continue to diminish. However, critically dry
conditions will persist throughout the day and likely into tomorrow
as well. Remember, "one less spark, one less wildfire!" Overnight
recovery begins to improve by Monday morning, with much better
improvement going into Wednesday.
