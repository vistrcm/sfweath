...New UPDATE...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 1246 AM PDT Sun Aug 18 2024

Temperatures at or slightly below seasonal averages continue through
the next week, along with breezy onshore flow and early morning
stratus.

.UPDATE...
Issued at 842 AM PDT Sun Aug 18 2024

Morning visible satellite imagery reveals a mixed bag of cloud
cover this morning with non-continuous status marine layer.
Regardless of coverage, decent coverage of clouds exist around
Monterey Bay/Salinas Valley/North Bay Valleys. Oakland morning
balloon sounding puts the depth around 2,500 feet. The deep marine
layer has led to fog and drizzle as well. Sonoma County Airport
reported dense fog and Monterey Airport reported fog. Lastly, the
very moist boundary layer led to measurable drizzle. Numerous
automated gages along the immediate coast and coastal hills showed
a few hundredths over the last 12 hours. This meteorologist
observed numerous puddles on the road for the morning commute.

For the rest of today...morning low clouds/fog/drizzle will
gradually diminish. Expecting mostly sunny skies today, especially
away from the coast. Some of the model guidance does suggest
patchy low clouds lingering along the coastline.

Did update the forecast earlier for drizzle/fog, but no other
updates needed.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 1246 AM PDT Sun Aug 18 2024

Satellite imagery shows extensive stratus development across the
region, as an upper level low off the coast of the Pacific Northwest
continues to promote temperatures below seasonal averages through
the region. Low temperatures tonight remain in the 50s to the low
60s throughout the regions, save the highest peaks of the Santa
Lucias where highs could rise into the upper 60s to lower 70s. High
temperatures will range from the upper 50s to mid 60s at the coast,
to the upper 60s to the mid 70s at the Bayshore, the mid 70s to the
mid 80s in the inland valleys with temperatures reaching the low 90s
in the warmest spots of southern Monterey County. Breezy onshore
flow will develop this afternoon and evening, with gusts as high as
20 to 30 miles per hour through gaps, passes, and northwest-
southeast oriented valleys.

.LONG TERM...
(Sunday night through next Friday)
Issued at 259 PM PDT Sat Aug 17 2024

As the upper-level low fills, temperatures will continue to warm up
through Tuesday. A brief, gradual cooldown will take place Wednesday
through Friday as troughing is expected to take shape. Uncertainty
with the forecast primarily lies in the amplitude of the trough -
will it be a cutoff low or will it be an open wave? If it is a
cutoff low, it will linger longer, the North Bay will have better
chances for measurable precipitation, and onshore winds will
noticeably increase. If it is an open wave, it will move through
quicker with the better chances of precipitation confined to the
north. Either way, any kind of troughing offshore will promote
moist, onshore flow, which is a good thing.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 423 AM PDT Sun Aug 18 2024

MVFR to IFR conditions are expected to persist through the late
morning to early afternoon today. Low marine stratus will persist
along the coast with fog/mist/drizzle lowering visibility at times
as well.

Vicinity of SFO...Winds have eased while stratus has filled in
across the Bay Area. MVFR ceilings are expected to persist through
late morning/early afternoon today, with VFR prevailing from mid
afternoon through early evening tonight, before low stratus
develops once again later tonight.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...MVFR/IFR ceilings can be expected to
persist through late morning, and possibly lingering through the
remainder of the forecast period. As the marine layer deepens this
morning, visibility may drop at times due to fog, drizzle and
mist along with wetting the runways as well.

&&

.MARINE...
(Tonight through next Thursday)
Issued at 259 PM PDT Sat Aug 17 2024

Light to gentle breezes are anticipated across most of the marine
zones tonight. The exception will be across the northern San
Francisco and San Pablo Bays where intermittent moderate breezes
are forecast. Primary swell will continue to roll in from the west
and northwest with wave heights ranging between 2 and 6 feet.
Fresh to moderate breezes are expected Sunday afternoon into next
week, especially near and south of Point Sur. In response, seas
will increase to 6 to 8 feet across southern zones and low-end
marine headlines may be needed Sunday afternoon and into early
next week.
