.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 345 AM PDT Wed Oct 4 2023

Surface high pressure continues to strengthen over the Pacific
Northwest, far northern California and the Great Basin resulting
in downsloping, warming and drying offshore breezes to the Bay
Area coastline today. The northerly pressure gradient and wind
will ease tonight and Thursday while surface high pressure remains
mostly confined to the Great Basin during late week. Expect well
above early October normal high temperatures, but high temperatures
should remain below record highs at the long term sites. Cooler
onshore breezes returning by late in the weekend with a mix of weak
upper level ridging and troughing.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 405 AM PDT Wed Oct 4 2023

The center of a strong 591 decameter 500 mb long wave ridge is
located approx 600 miles west of the Pacific Northwest. Surface
high pressure is strengthening over the Pacific Northwest, far
northern CA and across the Great Basin, a surface reflection of
the dynamics with the long wave ridge including in the wake of
the eastward moving low pressure system east of the Rockies. This
will result in downsloping, warming and drying offshore breezes
to the Bay Area coastline today. Profiler data and recent upper
air soundings from Oakland show steady warming aloft, currently
mid 70s Fahrenheit in the lower levels of the atmosphere per
latest profiler data. Post sun rise surface warming will connect
to this compressional warming aloft sending daytime temperatures
upwards quickly to warmer to hotter readings today; a signature of
fall season strengthening jet stream winds, Sep-Oct across our
forecast area is our highest frequency of offshore flow, warm to
hot and dry season weather to the coastline. 850 mb (~ 5000 feet)
temperatures forecast compared to long term Oakland upper air
climatology will be nearing the 75th percentile today, quite some
room below for example the long term maximum moving average. Thus
it`ll be tough to reach long term record high temperatures, today
at least.

Observations show gusty northeast winds have developed since late
Tuesday evening across the North Bay hills and mountains, especially
far northern Sonoma and Napa mountains. Gusts as high as 50-65
mph have been reported in the Mayacamas Mountains. Mt Diablo in
the East Bay has reported north to northeast wind gusts as high as
40 mph. Fire weather concerns are near marginal in these higher
locations due to gusty winds and humidity, helping here at least
is elevated fuel moistures for the time of year. Also what will
help minimize the duration of winds in the hills and mountains
just beyond today and tonight is the westerlies are in a progressive
pattern, the eastward motion of synoptic to planetary scale systems
will minimize the amount of northerly ACV-SFO surface pressure
gradient beginning later today and tonight with mainly surface
pressures focusing over the Great Basin i.e. the WMC-SFO gradient
later in the week.

Daytime highs today are forecast to reach the lower 90s inland and 80s
close to the coastline and bayside, how warm to hot it gets near the
coastline today ultimately depends on how well easterly winds develop
to the surface and coastline today. Some cooling returning tonight
and in the early hours Thursday, best chances for cooling will be in
the valley floors beneath the thermal belts where the lower level
temperature inversion will persist. With the gradual loss of the
ACV-SFO gradient and wind, longer night-time hours, lighter winds
on the valley floors will allow nocturnal radiative cooling. Our
valley forecast low temperatures may be a bit warm with respect to
recent forecast guidance thus there may be more mid to upper 50s
developing in the valleys before sunrise Thursday morning.

.LONG TERM...
(Thursday through Tuesday)
Issued at 405 AM PDT Wed Oct 4 2023

Expect a carryover of offshore wind, warm to hot and dry weather
Thursday with the WMC-SFO gradient holding strong near 10 mb,
however as mentioned the ACV-SFO gradient is forecast to weaken by
Thursday. This is at least in part good news since the weakening
ACV-SFO gradient and wind should begin to ease the strength of
the lower level temperature inversion over the Bay Area, also
minimizing northeast breezes for example across the Bay Area hills
and mountains. Beginning Friday the 500 mb long wave ridge begins
a period of deamplification while moving eastward, temporarily
weakening also due to some southward motion. The main long wave
500 mb ridge axis is to our east by early Saturday morning, weak
lingering 500 mb ridging to troughing will combine with onshore
breezes bringing cooler temperatures over the weekend and early
next week.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 423 AM PDT Wed Oct 4 2023

VFR through the TAF period. The building ridge pattern will limit
surface winds over the next few days, leading to light and variable
winds overnight, and light to moderate winds during the day. Fog and
mist probabilities decrease as the ridge continues to develop.

Vicinity of SFO...VFR through the TAF period. Expect light and
variable winds through the mid afternoon which will become more
moderate for the afternoon. Expect light and variable winds again
for int the night.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO

Monterey Bay Terminals...VFR through the TAF period. Winds stay
light and variable through the morning and into the afternoon.
Expect moderate westerly winds to build in the mid to late
afternoon. Winds become light again in the late evening.

&&

.MARINE...
(Tonight through next Sunday)
Issued at 344 AM PDT Wed Oct 4 2023

Breezy northwest winds will diminish this afternoon and become
light for the late week. Moderate period southerly swell 12 to 14
seconds persists through the week, in addition to a northwest
swell at around 11 to 13 seconds.
