...New AVIATION...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 250 AM PDT Sun May 14 2023

Coastal clouds and inland sunshine for Sunday. Southerly winds
will progress up the coast for Sunday bringing additional cooling
to coastal locations. Mild temperatures and dry conditions appear
on tap for next week.

&&

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 315 AM PDT Sun May 14 2023

First and foremost, a Dense Fog Advisory for was issued through 10
AM for Monterey Bay Coastline and San Francisco Peninsula
Coastline. A compressed marine layer with ample clouds over the
coastal waters and locally inland has also led to area of dense
fog being reported. Sensors around Monterey Bay and Half Moon Bay
have been reporting visibilities of one quarter to one half mile
at times. Similar to Saturday a gradual dissipation of fog will
happen mid to late morning. Farther inland, clear skies prevail
per satellite fog product.

The other weather item of note today will be cooldown temperature
wise. The upper level ridge and warm airmass that brought warmth
to the region on Saturday will end today. An upper level low
currently over NV will track westward and undercut the ridge. This
change in airmass will bring an overall cooling trend of 5-15
degrees to the Bay Area and Central Coast. Additionally, hi-res
models continue to advertise a southerly flow along the coast
given a summer-like southerly surge vibe. As a result, clouds and
cooler air flowing of the waters will keep places like Santa Cruz
colder. Monterey on the other hand may experience a slight
downslope flow, which will result in warmer temperatures.
Fortunately, the cooldown today will drop Heat Risk levels to Low.
Regardless, still be mindful of the sunshine and wear sunscreen.

.LONG TERM...
(Monday through Saturday)
Issued at 315 AM PDT Sun May 14 2023

The aforementioned upper level low pressure will gradually exit to
the PacNW late Sunday into Monday. In its wake, high pressure over
the Desert SW will edge toward CA. The building ridge of high
pressure will result in a slight warming trend through midweek.
Additionally, as inland areas warm back into the 80s to lower 90s
Heat Risk concerns return to Moderate. Cooler conditions will
persist at the coast with onshore flow and night/morning
clouds/fog. Earlier model runs hinted at some upper level moisture
sneaking over the region from the Desert SW, but latest trend has
been drier with less moisture. A few cumulus clouds hugging the
hills through out the week seems like a good bet.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 542 AM PDT Sun May 14 2023

Nighttime satellite imagery shows widespread coastal stratus at this
time, with intrusions into the Monterey Bay region causing LIFR
conditions at those terminals through much of the night. Elsewhere,
VFR conditions have lasted through much of the night with just a few
to scattered low clouds being reported, including SFO. Winds are
light at most terminals, but with a slightly more northerly
component than compared to this time last night, coming in around
300 degrees, which may have limited the the intrusion of coastal
stratus through the night, in addition to relative humidities being
drier compared to 24 hours ago. Nonetheless, expecting VFR to last
for most terminals (excluding Monterey Bay) through much of the day
before coastal stratus hints at a return in the early morning hours
of Monday, but with MVFR CIGs.

Current light winds look to turn southwesterly in the early
afternoon, becoming breezy to moderate (12-18 knots). Winds then
diminish into the night, becoming light.

Vicinity of KSFO...Currently VFR, but SCT low clouds will need to be
monitored through the morning, potentially becoming BKN at points,
though confidence is low at this time with around a 25% chance.
Nonetheless, expecting stratus to mix out around 17Z with VFR
lasting through the evening, before coastal stratus looks to return
bringing MVFR CIGs. Winds turn to become more southwesterly around
210 degrees into the afternoon and evening, with speeds up to 18
knots at KSFO. KOAK looks to take on a more westerly direction
around 11 knots.

SFO Bridge Approach..Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...Currently LIFR with decreased visibility.
Expecting IFR CIGs to last through the mid to late morning, with
CIGs beginning to lift and mix out towards 18Z, becoming VFR, though
SCT clouds may remain through the TAF period. Low CIGs look to
return into the overnight hours of Sunday into Monday, bringing IFR
conditions. Winds increase into the afternoon today to become breezy
to moderate, 12 to 15 knots,  out of the northwest before decreasing
into the night.

.MARINE...
(Tonight through next Thursday)
Issued at 1023 PM PDT Sat May 13 2023

Winds diminishing overnight and turning towards the south.
Another chance for low clouds, reduced visibility, and fog Sunday
morning. Longer period southerly swell, around 16 seconds,
continues alongside moderate period northerly swell through much
of the week.

&&

.MTR WATCHES/WARNINGS/ADVISORIES...
CA...Dense Fog Advisory until 10 AM PDT this morning for CAZ509-529-
     530.
