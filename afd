...New AVIATION...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 339 AM PDT Fri Jul 7 2023

A deeper marine layer as a result of a shortwave trough passing
through will give cause for later clearing for most regions, with
coastal zones potentially remaining under stratus for much of the
day. Temperatures continue to be on the cooler than normal side
through the weekend. Warming trend begins late next week as high
pressure builds in.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 339 AM PDT Fri Jul 7 2023

Another night, another period of not many changes to the pattern or
forecast. Nighttime satellite imagery at this time shows marine
stratus continuing to push inland, with many airport terminals
seeing low ceilings as a result. With the SFO-SAC gradient moderate
at around 3.2 mb, some tendrils of stratus have managed to snake
their way up the Delta. A shortwave trough passing through the
region has helped to deepen the marine layer, currently around 3000
feet, therefore allowing stratus to develop more abundantly and push
further inland than seen in previous days. As a result, stratus is
expected to persist through at least the mid morning hours before
retreating back to the coastlines as the sun rises. Coastal areas
may continue to be under the stratus deck through much of the day
Friday with only brief clearing in the late afternoon before stratus
returns early in the evening.

With this latest trough helping to once again put a damper on
temperatures, high temperatures will continue to be cool and
comfortable today and through the weekend with highs in the mid 60s
to 70s for coastal and bay areas, and 70s to upper 80s further
inland. Winds become breezy in the afternoons around 10-15 mph
through coastal mountain gaps, as well as along the near coast, then
easing into the evening.

.LONG TERM...
(Saturday through Thursday)
Issued at 339 AM PDT Fri Jul 7 2023

If you`re wondering when the summer-like warmth returns, look no
further than the end of next week. Both the CPC 6-10 day and 8-14
day outlooks suggest warmer than normal temperatures presiding over
our region. This is in agreement with model guidance that shows
ridging beginning to build into the area towards Thursday, moving
from the desert southwest into the region, becoming almost centered
over our region come Friday. Temperatures for typical hot spots in
inland areas look to range from the lows 90s to low 100s, with
coastlines remaining on the cooler side in the 60s to mid 70s.
Minimum temperatures offer relief overnight especially for those
warmer regions, with lows in the 50s and 60s. As such, heat risk is
currently only slight to moderate. Nonetheless, it never hurts to
be weather aware and prepared! Make sure to Look Before You Lock
and never leave pets or children in parked vehicles, check local
ocean conditions if going to the beach to beat the heat, swim near
a lifeguard, wear a life-vest when in the water, and never turn
your back on the ocean! Additionally, check in on vulnerable
populations sensitive to heat such as young children or elderly
people, and be sure to increase water intake to stay hydrated.
Stay tuned for more updates as we approach this future warm-up.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 426 AM PDT Fri Jul 7 2023

MVFR-IFR CIGs persist through much of the morning with light winds.
Widespread VFR returns as winds increase into the afternoon,
becoming moderate to breezy. Stratus looks to make an early return
in the evening for coastal areas as well as the Monterey Bay,
reducing CIGs to MVFR/IFR conditions with the SF Bay falling later
into the night.

Vicinity of SFO... MVFR/IFR CIGs around the terminal and approach
last through the late morning. VFR with breezy to gusty winds is
expected in the afternoon before stratus advects inland in the
early evening, leading to MVFR. Winds peak in the evening around
18 knots and 30 knot gusts before reducing into the night.


SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO, except low clouds will clear
sooner than SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...MVFR/IFR cigs persist through the TAF
period at MRY, but VFR returns for the afternoon for more inland
areas like SNS. Expect breezy westerly winds to build in the late
morning and last into the evening. SNS falls to MVFR as cloud
cover spreads inland in the early evening.

.MARINE...
(Today through Wednesday)
Issued at 339 AM PDT Fri Jul 7 2023

Expect breezy to gusty northwest winds through the weekend into
early next week. Near gale force gusts will develop along favored
coastal jets and coastal gaps during the afternoons and evenings,
resulting in steep wind waves that will be hazardous to small
craft. Mixed seas continue with a long period southerly swell and
a moderate period, light northwest swell.
