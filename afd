Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service San Francisco CA
635 AM PDT Sat May 13 2023

...New UPDATE...

.SYNOPSIS...
Look for warm weather through the weekend inland, with warmest
temperatures on Saturday. Closer to the waters, a shallow marine
layer and seabreeze winds will restrain temperature increases on
Saturday, with a southerly stratus surge then progressing up the
coast on Sunday. Mild temperatures and dry conditions appear on
tap for next week.

.UPDATE...
Issued at 632 AM PDT Sat May 13 2023

Visibility is dropping along coastal areas this morning with a
shallow marine layer in place. Dense Fog Advisories issued for the
Big Sur Coast, around/within Monterey Bay, and up the San
Francisco Peninsula. Greatest fog potential in downtown is over
the western half of the city. Be prepared for sudden visibility
changes this morning if you`re out and about. Fog should gradually
dissipate through about 10 AM this morning. No other changes to
the forecast.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 409 AM PDT Sat May 13 2023

The much discussed upper level ridge and spring heat will peak
today. No significant changes made to the short term forecast.
Longwave pattern continues to evolve and is trending toward a
messy looking Rex Block over the West. An anomalously strong upper
level ridge extends from CA/CA coastal waters northward to
PacNW/SW Canada. This ridge is sandwiched between a weak upper low
to the east near the Great Basin and a anomalously deep upper low
anchored near the Gulf of AK. This particular pattern will bring
unseasonable warmth to the Bay Area and Central Coast. Overnight
satellite imagery shows widespread stratus over the coastal
waters with some low clouds moving into the inland valleys. The
building ridge overhead has helped to compress the marine layer.
Therefore, do expect an earlier dissipation of low stratus this
morning. Coastal areas on the other hand will likely hold onto to
some clouds through out the day. Coastal/Bay locations will warm
into the upper 60s to upper 70s, but less marine influence inland
will lead to max temps in the 80s to mid 90s. These temps will
fall short for record temperatures, but still 5-20 degrees above
normal for mid May. Additionally, this warmth will bring a
Moderate Heat Risk. A Moderate Risk means heat will impact those
sensitive to heat, especially the elderly, infirmed, and very
young children. If you have outdoor plans today plan accordingly
for warmer weather. Additionally, if you head to the coast keep in
mind that the coastal waters are still cold and in the lower 50s.

.LONG TERM...
(Sunday through Friday)
Issued at 409 AM PDT Sat May 13 2023

Not much of a blocking pattern per se as the upper level longwave
pattern changes even with high pressure to the north and low
pressure to the south. The weak upper low to the east will drift
westward on Sunday undercutting the ridge. This upper low will
bring cooler weather to the region on Sunday with convection over
the Sierra. Temperatures will drop 5-10 degrees from Saturday to
Sunday. Despite the drop, temperatures will still be 5-10 degrees
above normal for mid May. One upside to the temp drop will be
Heat Risk concerns dropping back to Low for most areas. As noted
on the previous discussion, hi-res models continue advertise
southerly flow along the coast. Not a southerly surge in the
classic sense, but clouds will be banked up along the coast. Will
keep temperatures on the cool side for spots like Santa Cruz.

For next week - the upper low slowly wobbles over far NorCal
before exiting northward into the PacNW late Sunday into Monday.
Forecast still looks dry for the CWA. Temperatures will fluctuate
a few degrees each day, but mild conditions prevail inland with
marine cooled temperatures at the coast.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 517 AM PDT Sat May 13 2023

Winds are currently light (5 knots and below) throughout the region
and look to last through the late morning before increasing into the
afternoon to become onshore and breezy, around 10 to 12 knots. Winds
diminish again in the late evening to become light.

IFR CIGs and lowered visibilities seen at many terminals this
morning due to fog and a compressed marine stratus layer look to
clear towards the late morning, around 17Z. Beyond 17Z, expecting
widespread VFR and clear skies as stratus mixes out. Marine stratus
looks to return into the late overnight hours of Saturday into
Sunday as a southerly surge pushes in, reducing CIGs to IFR
conditions again for the KMRY, KSNS, KSFO, and KOAK terminals.

Vicinity of KSFO...Current IFR conditions look to improve to VFR
between 16 and 18Z as CIGs lift and stratus dissipates. Light winds
seen overnight increase into the afternoon and evening hours to
become breezy to moderate (12 to 14 knots) before weakening into the
night to become light. Towards 10Z Sunday, a southerly surge of
marine stratus may reduce CIGs to IFR conditions. Confidence is
medium with around a 53% chance that CIGs fall below 1000 feet.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...IFR CIGs and visibilities look to improve
towards the late morning hours, around 17-19Z, when stratus is
expected to mix out. Scattered clouds may continue to be present
through the afternoon, but otherwise expecting VFR through the
evening. Winds increase into the afternoon becoming onshore and
breezy, then becoming light again around 07Z. Southerly surge of
stratus will bring lowered CIGs and visibilities to IFR conditions
late tonight and into Sunday morning. There is around a 70% chance
that CIGs fall below 1000 feet early Sunday morning.

&&

.MARINE...
(Today through Thursday)
Issued at 320 AM PDT Sat May 13 2023

Northwesterly winds look to weaken slowly through Saturday night,
before winds turn to become southerly in the overnight hours of
Saturday into Sunday. On Sunday winds along the coast near Point
Lobos will be breezy to moderate, with lighter winds expected over
the outer waters, bringing with them a southerly surge of
stratus. A return to northerly and light winds is expected Monday
evening. Longer period southerly swell, around 16 seconds,
continues alongside moderate period northerly swell through much
of the week.
