...New AVIATION...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 209 AM PDT Tue Sep 26 2023

Early season rain continues over the North Bay and will move
south through the morning, but chances will diminish after
sunrise. Generally quiet, pleasant weather continues through the
week with the exception of breezy to locally gusty afternoons. Potential
for another trough this upcoming weekend.

&&

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 209 AM PDT Tue Sep 26 2023

Radar currently shows NNE/SSW oriented rain band moving slowly
across the North Bay as cold front approaches. Rainfall rates are
generally light and accumulations are staying mostly confined to
Sonoma and Marin counties. Total rainfall amounts thus far are
generally 0.3-0.5" across coastal terrain and up to 0.15" for
further inland spots such as Sonoma County Airport.

Rain chances quickly diminish after 5 am today as the front
slides south and weakens. 1" PW plume will also fall apart through
the morning, so not expecting much more in the way of rain
accumulations across the SF Peninsula after sunrise. While front
will continue to weaken, orographic lift will help to squeeze out
few hundredths of an inch of rain across coastal terrain down to
the Santa Cruz Mountains.

By the late morning, dry conditions resume across the area. It
should be a pleasant, clear day across the area with cooler than
average temperatures in the 70s across much of the area with some
interior spots reaching low 80s. It will also be breezy near the
coast as well as through coastal and inland valleys. If headed to
the coast, be advised that elevated surf is expected as large NW
swell propagates across the waters today. Large breaking waves
likely today especially for W/NW facing beaches. See BEACHES
section below for more.

.LONG TERM...
(Wednesday through Monday)
Issued at 209 AM PDT Tue Sep 26 2023

Breezy conditions continue into Wednesday. A robust northerly low
level jet will set up along the coast Wednesday afternoon, first
along the Big Sur Coast then eventually establishing across much of
the CA coastline. While strongest winds will stay over the coastal
waters, inland valleys and mountain passes could see wind gusts of
20-30 mph during the afternoons Wed-Fri. In addition to winds,
subtle warming is expected through Thursday but only warming to
seasonable normals (60s near the coast and mid 70s to mid 80s
inland).

By the weekend, it`s still looking like a more amplified synoptic
pattern will take shape with an upper low expected to dig down into
the Great Basin/Intermountain West this weekend. There`s still
uncertainty regarding the position, orientation, and strength of
this feature, so will continue to monitor closely as it may result
in offshore flow this weekend. Confidence remains low and we will
continue to monitor. Weekend temperatures will be cooler as this
upper low brings in a cooler airmass.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 509 AM PDT Tue Sep 26 2023

Currently a mix of VFR, MVFR, IFR, LIFR as the mid-level clouds
from the fropa continues to move over our region this morning. Some
of the rain in the North Bay has caused some lower visibility this
morning but expect conditions to improve near 17-19Z along with the
remaining region where VFR conditions are expected to return. Any
chances of drizzle/light rain diminished as we approach sunrise. VFR
is expected to prevail through the TAF period for all terminals as
conditions are expected to become drier. Winds are expect to
transition from a S/SW direction to N/NW winds this afternoon with
moderate to breezy wind speed. There is some uncertainty if winds
will become breezy (>13 kts) near Monterey Bay and KLVK, as only a
few models suggest up to 13-14 kt this afternoon but had low
confidence to include in TAFs.

Vicinity of SFO...MVFR conditions currently and is expected to
improve to VFR near 18Z as is expected to prevail through the
remainder of the TAF period. Winds are expected to become WNW with
the return of gusty winds in the afternoon up to 20-27 kt then a
transition back to moderate speeds tomorrow morning.

SFO Bridge Approach... Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...A mix of VFR and MVFR conditions. Expect
KSNS to become MVFR closer to 13-14Z with both terminals conditions
improving to VFR near 18-19Z and is expected to remain VFR through
the rest of the TAF period. Winds are showing a bit of a variable
direction but will become W/NW this afternoon with moderate
speeds. &&

.MARINE...
(Tonight through next Saturday)
Issued at 306 PM PDT Mon Sep 25 2023

Fresh to strong breezes over the northern outer waters,
diminishing throughout the night as winds turn from the south to
the north. Fresh to strong breezes develop tomorrow across the
southern waters, with gale force gusts possible in the coastal jet
near the Big Sur coast. Northwest swell from a low off the coast
of the Pacific Northwest is arriving in the coastal waters. The
worst conditions will be tomorrow with 12-15 ft seas in a 15
second NW swell. A small craft advisory is in effect for all
unprotected waters.

&&

.BEACHES...
Issued at 209 AM PDT Tue Sep 26 2023

A large northwest swell is moving through the coastal waters which
will impact beaches from Sonoma County down to Big Sur. As a
result, a High Surf Advisory will go into effect at 5am today
lasting through 11pm due to large breaking waves generally around
12 to 16 feet, with locally higher conditions around 15 to 20
feet for steep-sloped beaches. Northwest facing beaches are most
at risk for these hazardous conditions. Coastal buoys as of 2 AM
are already showing elevated seas with significant wave heights
around 12-14 feet at 14 seconds.

Conditions at beaches will be dangerous for swimmers, surfers,
and beachgoers. If planning to visit a beach, caution is advised,
as large waves can sweep across beaches with no warning, pulling
people into the ocean from jetties, beaches, and rocks. Remember
to never turn your back on the ocean, and check local conditions
such as tides and currents before visiting.

Exercise caution even after the high surf advisory has ended, as
energy in the ocean can be slow to diminish and large waves may
continue to be present afterwards until fully dissipated.
