.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 243 AM PDT Sat Sep 30 2023

An early season cold front will pass through the Bay Area and
Central Coast this morning with some rain showers. Most areas will
remain dry and seasonal today but isolated showers will be
possible through this afternoon, especially interior hills of Napa
county. Dry northerly flow returns overnight into Sunday. Warming
trend with dry weather next week.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 243 AM PDT Sat Sep 30 2023

Its a fitting end to the 2023 Water Year (new one starts Oct 1st)
as a fairly strong early season front and upper trough passes
over the region. Showers are breaking out across the region early
this morning, especially from the Bay Area southward as a surface
boundary pivots around the upper low which is pinwheeling over
Butte county where numerous thunderstorms occurred overnight.
Moist upslope flow across the Sierra will continue to generate
rain and high mountain snow for the last day of September. Rain
amounts are light but last hour Ben Lomond reported 0.05 with most
locations reporting about a hundredth as fast moving showers pass
over the region. By sunrise most of the lingering activity should
be over the Monterey Bay region as people wake up to wet roads
and driveways wondering if it was all a dream. The upper low will
stay close enough to generate instability from late morning
through the afternoon with the best chance for showers later today
across the hills of Napa county and around Mt Hamilton. The rest
of the Bay Area will enjoy pleasant temperatures in the upper 60s
and lower 70s with some breezy northwest winds at times. Overall
ideal conditions for outdoor activities to start the weekend. A
drying trend this evening as the low slowly moves inland and drier
northerly flow ushers in over the region.

.LONG TERM...
(Sunday through Friday)
Issued at 243 AM PDT Sat Sep 30 2023

The low will be over the Great Basin on Sunday with just dry
northerly flow continuing to keep the forecast dry and
temperatures comfortable under mostly sunny skies with seasonal
highs in the upper 60s and 70s in what will turn out to be some
pretty nice weather across the Bay Area for outdoor activities.

High pressure over the East Pac will try and nose over the region
by early in the week as some brief bouts of dry northerly winds
will try and pass over the Napa hills. The pattern between the
departing low and building high just isn`t ideal for strong
offshore winds. However there will be a gradual warming and drying
trend with lowering humidity values, especially inland. When
looking at the EFI (extreme forecast index) for Max Temps you can
see how banal the pattern is as it suggests just seasonally warm
weather for the start of the work week with plenty of sunshine.
The first week of October can often be one of the warmest of the
season and we`ll see a noted warming trend Weds through Friday as
the East Pac 590 dm ridge builds over the region. Look for daytime
highs to warm well into the upper 80s with some low to mid 90s
where idealized downslope flow develops such as places like Santa
Rosa. Right now the models suggest Weds/Thursday as the hottest
days of the upcoming week. The longer nights and drier airmass
will allow for good nighttime cooling so no heat products
expected. The pattern will dry the fuels and at least increase
fire weather concerns as we head into the historical peak month
for fire weather concerns for the Bay Area. Some periods of
offshore winds this week but nothing strong or sustained forecast
at this time. The West coast ridge and warm/dry pattern should
last through at least the first weekend of October. Will be on the
lookout to see if any West Pac moisture gets injected into East
Asian jet and tries to make its way eastward by mid-month.
