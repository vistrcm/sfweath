.UPDATE...
Issued at 935 AM PDT Tue Aug 12 2025

It`s August so of course we`re talking about Fogust. As noted
below, the marine layer is pretty solid this morning with great
inland penetration. Over the last hour we`re finally beginning to
see some thinning on the edges. This thinning or gradual clearing
will persist through late morning. While inland areas will see
some sun, the coastal areas hang onto the clouds today.

If you happened to view the satellite imagery this morning you`ll
notice a few higher level clouds west of Pt Conception. This
cluster of clouds are associated with a pocket of moisture from
the decayed TS Ivo. So the big question over the last few days and
this morning has been, what happens to the moisture. Do we get
showers, thunderstorms, virga, or nothing? Based on satellite
trends, upstream NUCAPs soundings, CAMS NWP, and experience feel
comfortable with not ruling out a passing shower or two. There are
definitely ingredients to be concerned with, but not all line up
in the right spot or overlap timewise. Would like to see some
better lift/instability through the layer of moisture aloft.
Would also like to see moisture track farther north. A trough to
the north will block some of the moisture transport flow as seen
by guidance showing more zonal and less meridional flow. All that
being said, think passing showers or virga shower will be
possible late tonight and Wednesday over the Central Coast into
the Bay Area. Not enough confidence to add showers to the forecast
just yet. Will fine to this thinking with the afternoon forecast
package.

.SHORT TERM...
Issued at 320 AM PDT Tue Aug 12 2025
(Today and tonight)

It`s finally happening! The pattern change begins today. First up,
it wouldn`t be a night shift discussion this week without
mentioning it, the status of the stratus! Satellite imagery shows
stratus blossoming across a good portion of the region including
interior valleys of the Bay Area. This matches the marine layer
foot print of 1200-1500ft. Expect to see the spread continue for
the next few hours with stratus gradually starting to mix out
after sunrise. Much like yesterday, look for mostly sunny skies
for interior locations and for clouds to hang around the coast.
High temperatures for most locations will be a few degrees cooler,
with interior Bay Area counties and Santa Cruz County seeing
highs in the low 80s to mid 90s compared to the mid 80s to near
105 degrees for interior Monterey and San Benito. Closer to the
coast, where nature`s AC holds, highs will be closer to the mid
50s to low 70s.

.LONG TERM...
Issued at 320 AM PDT Tue Aug 12 2025
(Wednesday through Monday)

No major changes from the previous long term forecast. Remnant
moisture from former (it is no longer a named storm) Post-Tropical
Cyclone Ivo remains of interest. Currently on Saturday you can
see this being pulled north on satellite imagery this Tuesday
morning. Guidance remains fairly lack luster thanks to an upper
level trough swing into the PacNW which should limit the lifting
mechanism needed for shower or thunderstorm development. Should
this arrival be delayed or be a bit more to our north, there may
be more room for convective development as there is some CAPE,
reasonable moisture, and decent lapse rates. Like we saw on Monday
afternoon, there are a few CAMs that try to generate isolated
showers over the region. But for now, we`re not expecting anything
in the way of precipitation. Outside of that we can look forward
to the cooling trend and coastal stratus and drizzle lasting into
the weekend.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 414 AM PDT Tue Aug 12 2025

Currently a mixed bag of LIFR-VFR at the terminals with a marine
layer of 1,200 feet. Moderate (50-70%) confidence in widespread
VFR this afternoon with lower confidence at coastal and bayshore
terminals than interior terminals. An upper-level shortwave
trough will approach towards the end of the TAF period, likely
beginning to deepen the marine layer with similar conditions on
tap tonight as what is underway.

Vicinity of SFO...Currently IFR with westerly flow. High confidence
in VFR by the afternoon with high (80%) confidence on an IFR ceiling
returning to the terminal tonight. Westerly winds will prevail
through the TAF period.

SFO Bridge Approach...30% probability that OAK does not achieve VFR
and that low stratus clouds linger through the TAF period.

Monterey Bay Terminals...Currently LIFR with westerly flow at MRY
and IFR with westerly flow at SNS. 30% probability that MRY does not
achieve VFR. High (70%) confidence on ceilings on the cusp of
LIFR/IFR returning to both terminals tonight.

.MARINE...
(Today through Sunday)
Issued at 935 AM PDT Tue Aug 12 2025

A gentle to moderate northwesterly breeze will prevail today,
increasing to become fresh to strong Wednesday with widespread
strong gusts by Thursday. Moderate seas will build to become
rough for inner waters and outer waters by Thursday.

.BEACHES...
Issued at 248 AM PDT Tue Aug 12 2025

A long period (17 seconds) southwesterly swell will result in an
increased risk for sneaker waves and rip currents through this
evening. Greatest risk will be along southwest facing beaches,
including but not limited to Stinson Beach, Santa Cruz Boardwalk
Beach, and Twin Lakes Beach. Sneaker waves can unexpectedly run
significantly farther up the beach than normal, including over
rocks and jetties. Remain out of the water to avoid hazardous
swimming conditions and never turn your back on the ocean!
