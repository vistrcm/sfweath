.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 116 AM PST Thu Nov 7 2024

A Red Flag Warning remains in effect through 7 AM today for
critically dry conditions and strong offshore flow. Fire weather
concerns ease this weekend as rainfall chances come back into the
forecast.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 116 AM PST Thu Nov 7 2024

A Red Flag Warning remains in effect through 7 AM today for the
interior North Bay, San Francisco Peninsula Coast, San Francisco Bay
Shoreline, and East Bay Hills due to strong offshore winds and
critically dry conditions. The SFO-WMC pressure gradient peaked at
-14.1 mb at 15Z (7 AM) Wednesday. It is currently observed at
-11.5 mb and is expected to continue this weakening trend as high
pressure over the Intermountain West weakens and coastal troughing
over the West Coast retrogrades offshore, thus weakening the surface
pressure gradient and the associated winds. There is uncertainty on
when exactly the pressure gradient will reverse to become positive
(onshore), but reasonable best case scenario (for fire weather
concerns) would be as early as Friday night. Offshore flow will
allow for critically dry conditions to persist through the day with
moderate relative humidity recovery expected in bayside, coastal,
and valley locations and poor relative humidity recovery expected in
the higher elevations. High pressure with stable air and light winds
will allow for smoke/haze from the Mountain Fire in Ventura County
to be seen across the Central Coast.

.LONG TERM...
(Friday through Wednesday)
Issued at 116 AM PST Thu Nov 7 2024

The region will remain under the influence of the positively tilted
upper-level ridge over the Pacific Northwest and the upper-level
cutoff low over Arizona through Saturday which will result in near
normal temperatures. We say good riddance to fire weather concerns
and hello to renewed chances for rainfall beginning Sunday night.
While rainfall totals with this system have trended downwards,
widespread rainfall is still expected with amounts tapering from
north to south. This is not looking like a fire season ending event
(~2.0 inches of rain within 72 hours), but even non-fire season
ending events are beneficial and this Red Flag Warning event is a
prime example of that.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 340 AM PST Thu Nov 7 2024

VFR through the TAF period. Offshore flow still prevails, but
weaker than 24 hours. While keeping dry air over the region the
weaker winds have eliminated LLWS potential.

Vicinity of SFO...VFR. Winds will switch this
afternoon to NW.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...VFR.

&&

.MARINE...
(Today through Tuesday)
Issued at 340 AM PST Thu Nov 7 2024

Northerly winds will persist over the coastal waters, but much
weaker than previous days. A smaller moderate period northwesterly
swell will remain as well. Winds increase early next week as a
storm system bringing rain moves through.

&&

.FIRE WEATHER...
Issued at 350 AM PST Thu Nov 7 2024

The updated RFW from last evening is working out well. Still
seeing many locations hitting criteria due to poor humidity
recoveries despite weaker winds. At this point will let the RFW
ride out through 7 AM. Even though the RFW ends at 7 AM it doesn`t
not mean all fire concerns just vanish. The offshore gradient
(main driver of the winds) will continue to ease and weaken
through out the day. However, the direction is still offshore
meaning little change in the overall airmass. Therefore, RH values
will be on the critical to near critical range this afternoon.
Best way to describe the fire weather environment Thursday is
slight improvement, but still near critical conditions for many
locations.
