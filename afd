...New UPDATE...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 902 AM PDT Thu Jun 26 2025

Seasonal temperatures with night and morning stratus will continue
into next week.

&&

.UPDATE...
Issued at 902 AM PDT Thu Jun 26 2025

Much less stratus coverage this morning with the marine layer
around 1100 feet and mainly impacting SF Bay and Monterey Bay
region with lots more sunshine for the North Bay this morning.
Local northeast winds aloft are coming off Mt Saint Helena and
ushering in drier air and sunny skies across the North Bay this
morning. Low clouds in the Berkeley hills should erode shortly
while the Salinas Valley clouds are starting to slowly mix out.

In general expect a few degrees of a warming trend for inland
areas today with some earlier sunshine even with continued onshore
wind pattern.

Expect the marine layer to continue to compress to less than 1000
feet into Friday. This in combination with building ridge should
lead to inland highs back into the lower to mid 90s for places
like Santa Rosa, Concord and Livermore just in time for a nice
summer weekend. Models suggest a decent cool down by Sunday as a
weak trough off the coast induces a cool southwesterly onshore
push for places like Santa Rosa and Napa. Next weeks forecast will
revolve around that upper low. Will check over the 12z models and
focus on the extended for the afternoon packages.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 227 AM PDT Thu Jun 26 2025

Another June day on tap with temperatures generally near seasonal
normals. The marine layer is currently being observed at 1,100
feet on the Fort Ord profiler with satellite showing stratus along
the Pacific Coast, through the Golden Gate Gap, and down the
Northern Salinas Valley. Expect stratus to retreat towards the
coast by late-morning with some mist/drizzle possible until then.
Your weather nugget of the day is that the 00Z 06/26/2025 weather
balloon recorded a precipitable water value of 0.42 inches, that
is below the 10th percentile (0.48 inches) for the day.

A Coastal Flood Advisory (the last one of this astronomical high
tide sequence) is in effect from 11PM Thursday through 2AM Friday
for Bayshore locations of the San Francisco Bay and San Pablo Bay
for minor coastal flooding during nocturnal high tide. Known impacts
occur in Bayside Marin County where coastal locations next to
Richardson Bay such as Sausalito, Tam Valley, Manzanita, the
Sausalito-Mill Valley Bike Path, and the Manzanita Park N Ride
experience localized flooding. As always, do not drive around
barricades or through water of unknown depth.

.LONG TERM...
(Friday through Wednesday)
Issued at 227 AM PDT Thu Jun 26 2025

Typical June Gloom/No Sky July long term forecast on tap with one
caveat...

Global ensemble clusters are in agreement of an upper-level
shortwave trough making its way into our area late weekend into
early next week. All three deterministic models (Canadian, ECMWF,
and GFS) show a negatively-tilted 582 dam upper-level cutoff low off
our coast at 12Z (5AM) Monday. While that may sound exciting, as of
now there`s no mentionable precipitation or thunderstorm chances.
Precipitable water values are forecast to increase, but point model
soundings show 0 CAPE, so instability seems to be the missing
ingredient from the three ingredients method (lift, instability,
moisture). As is typical with cutoff lows, they are notoriously
difficult to forecast due to their lack of jet stream support. Add
in an active Eastern Pacific Basin and the forecast becomes even
more complex - which is what we are dealing with!

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 437 AM PDT Thu Jun 26 2025

A compressed marine layer is helping to limit widespread coverage
of low marine stratus, currently lingering in the vicinity of the
Bay Area terminals. Expect the stratus to begin clearing by late
morning with a return to IFR/MVFR ceilings later tonight into
Friday morning.

Vicinity of SFO...Bay Area terminals will continue to hover
between IFR/MVFR ceilings with VFR expected by late this morning
with occasional light drizzle. Gusty onshore winds will settle in
this afternoon before easing after sunset. IFR ceilings are
expected to fill back in later this evening.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...Low stratus with patchy fog/drizzle will
persist through the late morning under a compressed marine layer.
Stratus and fog/drizzle is expected to begin to mix out by late
this morning into early afternoon. Breezy to gusty onshore winds
can be expected this afternoon and early evening, with a return of
the marine layer expected in the early evening when the winds
begin to ease.

.MARINE...
(Today through Tuesday)
Issued at 437 AM PDT Thu Jun 26 2025

Fresh to strong northwesterly breezes with near-gale force gusts
will continue through Friday. Gale force gusts can be expected
near the coastal jet regions of Point Reyes and Point Sur this
afternoon and evening. Moderate to rough seas will also continue
through tomorrow, with northwesterly winds easing over the
weekend.
