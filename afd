.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 200 AM PDT Sat Aug 19 2023

An unsettled weather pattern is expected for early next week with
cooler temperatures, more cloud cover, and increased shower
chances. This potential is greatest for inland portions of the
Central Coast as the remnants of Tropical Cyclone Hilary pass to
our east.

&&

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 200 AM PDT Sat Aug 19 2023

The upper pattern features a closed upper circulation centered
offshore from the Central Coast and a stout high pressure ridge over
the southern Great Plains. Tropical Cyclone Hilary will be drawn
poleward between these features and should straddle the northern
Baja California peninsula by tonight. Locally a deep marine layer
will remain in place today with low clouds gradually clearing to the
coast during the late morning hours. By tonight a slight uptick in
tropospheric humidity is noted as the upper low wobbles a bit
closer to the coast. This should bring enough lift and moisture to
generate some transient showers overnight. Any rain amounts from
them should be quite minimal. High temperatures today should range
from around 70 on the coast to the lower/mid 90s closer to the
Sacramento Valley. Lows tonight should be in the 55-60 degree
range for most of the lower elevations. Dewpoints will remain in
the upper 50s to lower 60s so the air may feel a bit muggy at
times.

.LONG TERM...
(Sunday through Friday)
Issued at 200 AM PDT Sat Aug 19 2023

The forecast remains on track with the upper low pinwheeling
offshore and Hilary accelerating northward. The consensus track
remains tightly clustered among the dynamical and statistical
models, with Hilary expected to move near or over northern Baja
California before reaching southern California. The effects of
shear, land interaction, and cooling SSTs should cause its decay to
a tropical storm before reaching the International Border. One
change has been an expected increase in forward motion, with the
greatest impacts for SoCal now anticipated on Sunday. Rain should be
the greatest hazard there, with catastrophic and life-threatening
flash flooding likely. Please keep this in mind if you have travel
plans or know someone down that way in a location vulnerable to
flooding. Otherwise this trend remains conducive for lesser impacts
across the Bay Area as the deepest moisture and strongest winds
remain displaced to our southeast. That said chance to slight
chances for rain (15-25 percent) should reach the Bay Area on Sunday
and persist into Monday. Inland portions of the Central Coast have
slightly better odds of being clipped by Hilary`s moisture with rain
chances reaching the 30-50 percent chance range from early Monday
morning through late Monday afternoon. An isolated thunderstorm is
possible in these areas as well given a little more instability. So
confidence remains high that the greatest impacts from Hilary should
remain outside of our area. However any changes to the track or
timing could impact our local forecast so keep up with the latest
information from the NWS and National Hurricane Center. Expect
cooler temperatures area-wide on Monday given clouds and showers,
with a gradual warming trend thereafter.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 434 AM PDT Sat Aug 19 2023

The center of a 500 mb cold core cut-off low remains approx 150
miles west of Point Conception with an extension of troughing to
the north across our coastal waters (including the offshore
waters); 500 heights & temperatures near 10th percentile for mid
August per Oakland upper air climatology i.e. unusually chilly at
this level for mid August. 00z & 06z Oakland soundings showed ~
1000 J/kg & 450 J/kg convective potential at mid levels. Isolated
late Friday evening mid tropospheric convection, echo tops to ~ 30
thousand feet developed within the thermal trough extension to
the north of the 500 mb low center. No other activity seen at this
time, however will continue to monitor areas steepening 700-500
mb temperature lapse rates e.g. in vicinity Monterey Bay through
early morning, plus overall satellite and radar.

Coastal stratus and fog /LIFR-IFR/ continue to develop under a
slightly compressing marine layer depth ~ 1500 feet per Bodega Bay
and Point Sur profiler data. Inland it`s VFR. Coastal stratus and
fog moving inland on onshore winds then mixing out by late morning.
At 925 mb level (~2500 feet) cool air advection returns from south
to north beginning later today, continuing tonight into Sunday
morning, the marine layer depth likely deepening with stratus and
fog /IFR/ extending inland. A slight chance of showers is in the
public forecast, added vicinity showers to the Bay Area TAFs.

Vicinity of SFO...MVFR ceiling mixing out by 1630z today, west wind
5 to 10 knots through morning. West to northwest wind increasing to
15 to 20 knots this afternoon and early evening. Increasing mid to
high clouds tonight and Sunday with a few showers.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...LIFR-IFR due to coastal stratus and fog,
mixing out to VFR by late this morning. Light and variable winds
early this morning becoming west 10 to 12 knots this afternoon and
early evening. Coastal stratus and fog /MVFR-IFR/ redeveloping and
moving inland tonight and Sunday morning per HREF output.

.MARINE...
(Today through Thursday)
Issued at 424 AM PDT Sat Aug 19 2023

Fresh northwest winds continue for the far northern outer waters,
lighter winds continue over the remaining coastal waters and bays,
with the SF bay becoming gusty into the afternoons and evenings.
Increasingly gusty southerly winds developing over the inner
southern coastal waters later Sunday night and Monday.
Northwesterly winds then redeveloping across the coastal waters
beginning mid late next week. Moderate period southerly swell
through the weekend alongside shorter period northwesterly swell,
with new southerly swell arriving towards the middle of next week.

     evening for PZZ530.

     Small Craft Advisory from 3 PM to 9 PM PDT Sunday for PZZ535-560-
