.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 151 AM PDT Mon Oct 16 2023

Patchy dense fog is impacting portions of the North Bay and
Monterey Bay early this morning. A weakening cold front will
approach the coastal waters and North Bay this afternoon, but
chance for rain looks very unlikely at this point. A warmup is
expected beginning Tuesday with Thursday being the hottest day.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 151 AM PDT Mon Oct 16 2023

Night fog satellite imagery shows patchy low clouds hugging the
coastline early this morning. Low cloud coverage not as expansive
compared to last night and patchy fog is staying mostly confined to
the Monterey Bay region, the coastline, and N Bay valleys. Airport
sensors across the Monterey Bay have been dropping to visibilities
of a quarter mile, so a Dense Fog Advisory was just issued for
the Monterey Bay region and N Salinas Valley through 10 AM. For
the SF Bay Area, there`s less of a chance for dense fog but it has
been developing near Santa Rosa and Petaluma. It`s a trickier fog
forecast north of the Monterey Bay with approaching upper level
trough from the north. Will continue to monitor early obs early
this morning (satellite imagery will become increasingly harder to
monitor with increasing high level clouds). Continue to use
caution on your morning commute for sudden changes in visibility
on the roads.

Later today, a weakening cold front is also on track to approach
the North Bay this afternoon. Not expecting any rain from this
front, but it will bring slightly cooler temperatures across the
region today with highs in the mid 60s to low 70s near the coast
and upper 70s to mid 80s further inland.

.LONG TERM...
(Tuesday through Sunday)
Issued at 151 AM PDT Mon Oct 16 2023

Strong high pressure will start building in wake of an exiting upper
level shortwave starting Tuesday. Ensemble guidance has been
consistently advertising the 500 mb ridge strengthening to 591 dm
heights during Wed-Thurs timeframe. Under this ridge, 850 mb
temperatures are projected to reach 22-23 degC (72-73F) during
this timeframe. These are impressively warm temperatures aloft for
this time of year, exceeding the 90th percentile of 18-19 degC
according to OAK sounding climatology.

All this being said, confidence is high that another fall season
warmup will be underway starting on Tuesday with Thursday still on
track to be the warmest day. Now that we`re 2-3 days out from
warmup, models are getting a better handle on forecast temps. Over
the last few days, forecast highs been trending warmer with some
climate sites now flirt with breaking daily records for Thursday
(see CLIMATE section below for daily records 10/18 through 10/20).
Max temps in the upper 80s to mid 90s forecast for Thursday across
the interior. NBM continues to highlight a 70-90% chance for
temps above 90 degrees on Thursday for the southern portions of
the Santa Clara valley (south of Morgan Hill), the Santa Cruz
Mountains, and S Monterey County. Lower chances of 30-40% exist
for the bay shoreline as well as interior East Bay and North Bay
valleys.

HeatRisk becomes elevated Wed-Thurs for areas removed from the
immediate coastline with a moderate risk of heat illness for
sensitive populations. May have to start thinking about potential
heat products for midweek, so stay updated with the forecast in
the coming days.

The heat will start to break on Friday as the upper ridge begins
to break down. WPC ensemble cluster analysis shows differing
solutions for days 6-7 on strength/position/timing of an upper
level trough, so extent of cooling into the weekend remains more
uncertain.
