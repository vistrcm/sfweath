.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 253 AM PST Wed Nov 27 2024

Drier and cooler conditions continue as a weak low pressure system
continues to move out of our area. Overnight lows will hover in
the low to mid 30s for much of the interior beginning Wednesday
night through Saturday morning.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 253 AM PST Wed Nov 27 2024

KMUX shows a few scattered showers continuing offshore of the Big
Sur coastline while high clouds lead create overcast conditions
throughout the Bay Area and Central Coast. High resolution model
guidance shows showers decreasing over the marine environment by the
afternoon with dry conditions to continue afterwards. In the wake of
our departing system, a cooler and drier air mass has moved in with
the 00Z (4PM) sounding showing winds backing (rotating CCW) with
height indicating cold air advection in the lower levels of the
atmosphere. A look at the 24 hour temperature change shows
temperatures are running about 10 to 13 degrees cooler this morning
than they were yesterday. Most sites are expected to dip into the
low to mid 40s tonight while the coldest interior locations may drop
as low as the mid 30s. Anyone venturing out during the early morning
hours should consider bundling up given the relatively chilly
morning conditions. Cold overnight temperatures will continue into
the weekend with a Frost Advisory to go into effect at 10 PM tonight
through 9AM Thursday. High clouds will clear out by late morning
with clear skies through the rest of the day. The lack of cloud
cover will help temperatures to warm a few (1-3) degrees compared to
yesterday. Inland locations will see temperatures in the low to mid
60s while coastal locations stay in the upper 50s to low 60s. &&

.LONG TERM...
(Thursday through Tuesday)
Issued at 253 AM PST Wed Nov 27 2024

Ridging will continue to build over the West Coast and will dominate
through the long term forecast. Cold morning low temperatures
continue Thursday morning and again Friday morning. A Frost Advisory
has been issued for portions of the interior North Bay, East Bay,
South Bay, and Central Coast. Temperatures are expected to hover
around freezing in those locations while the coldest locations in
the North Bay and Central Coast may drop as low as 30 degrees.
Morning temperatures will remain chilly Saturday and Sunday with
lows in the mid 30s to low 40s for most areas. Not a fan of chillier
mornings? Morning lows are expected to warm (slightly) and remain in
the 40s for most locations Monday through Wednesday with only the
coldest locations dropping into the upper 30s. High temperatures see
a similar trend where highs linger in the low to mid 60s across the
interior and upper 50s to low 60s along the coast through Friday.
High temperatures will warm into the mid to upper 60s throughout the
interior and upper 50s to mid 60s along the coast Saturday through
Wednesday. Conditions are expected to remain dry through the end of
the forecast period with ridging over the West Coast pushing the
storm track well to our north. CPC guidance continues above normal
temperatures and below normal precipitation through the 8 to 14 day
outlook (through December 10th).
