...New AVIATION...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 110 AM PDT Mon May 22 2023

Temperatures will warm for the interior valleys Monday with
breezy westerly winds keeping coastal areas cooler. After Tuesday,
an upper level trough leads to a cooldown with highs in the 60s
and 70s.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 110 AM PDT Mon May 22 2023

It`s a clearer night for the Bay Area but not as much for the
Monterey Bay. The changing upper level pattern is preventing cloud
cover from filling into the SF Bay, but the pressure perturbation
isn`t reaching far enough to prevent cloud cover for areas to the
south. What does that mean? Temperatures will continue cooling
around the Bay Area, why the Monterey Bay`s temperatures begin to
plateau. Clear skies for the Bay Area also means quicker warming
into the late morning.

Monday is setting up to be the warmest day of the forecast. Coastal
areas will peak in the 60s, inland areas will lean more toward the
mid 70s and low 80s, and the more interior areas will be in
the 80s with a few spots approaching the 90 degree mark.

&&

.LONG TERM...
(Tuesday through Sunday)
Issued at 110 AM PDT Mon May 22 2023

The upper-level pattern switches to a prolonged trough set up for
Tuesday, bringing more onshore flow. This will cool temperatures
across the area for Tuesday with highs back into the 60s and 70s for
most areas and lows mostly in the upper 40s and low 50s. The
persistent pattern means there will be very little movement in
temperatures through the rest of the forecast period.

The longer term models and ensembles have a bit more variation than
previous runs, but continue to entertain the idea of replacing the
mid-week`s trough with another similar trough pattern. Confidence is
growing that May ends with mild temperatures and onshore flow.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 431 AM PDT Mon May 22 2023

A mix of VFR and MVFR conditions over the region, but mostly North
Bay and Monterey Bay areas show MVFR conditions. Some models suggest
that SF bay terminals may have MVFR cigs this morning but with a
strong northerly gradient, confidence was low to include in the
TAFs. High confidence that all terminals will experience VFR
conditions near 15-18Z, as diurnal heating takes into effect.
Moderate confidence that SF bay will experience MVFR cigs near
midnight tonight, will continue to monitor if flight category
changes is needed.

Vicinity of SFO...Moderate confidence that VFR will prevail this
morning, as models suggest a possibility of MVFR cigs. High
confidence that VFR conditions will dominate most of the day until
midnight, where there is a chance of MVFR cigs. High confidence that
winds will remain moderate to breezy, with a N/NW component
throughout the TAF period.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...Expect IFR conditions for both terminals.
Models suggest a chance of LIFR conditions this morning but had low
confidence to include. High confidence that conditions will improve
near 17-18Z but MVFR/IFR conditions are anticipated to return
tonight. Winds are expected to remain onshore and moderate to
breezy through the TAF period.

.MARINE...
(Today through Friday)
Issued at 900 PM PDT Sun May 21 2023

A weak surface low pressure area is located just south of Point
Reyes this morning, surface high pressure is located over the
eastern Pacific. Expect breezy to gusty northwest winds over the
waters with gale force gusts across the northern waters early this
week. Across the inner waters and bays, winds peaking each
afternoon and evening. In addition, wind driven waves will cause
hazardous seas for small craft. A series of southerly swells
continues, with heights around 2 to 3 feet and periods generally
around 14 to 16 seconds until the middle of next week. Upper level
troughing will redevelop over the forecast area early to mid
week.
