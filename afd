...New AVIATION...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 238 AM PDT Tue Jul 25 2023

Expect warm conditions inland today with cooler weather closer to
the coast...similar to yesterday. Onshore winds continue with a
gradually increasing marine layer as our region is impacted by
a trough to the north.

&&

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 238 AM PDT Tue Jul 25 2023

Marine layer compressed yesterday evening, but is expected to
increase later today as our CWA is influenced by an upper level
low over western Canada with its trough extending into the Pac NW
and NorCal. Bodega Bay profiler shows a marine depth a little
over 1000 ft deep after showing a gradual increase overnight. The
Fort Ord profiler to the south is between 600-800 ft
deep...shallower than the North Bay due to being closer to the
large high pressure system sitting over the southern US. Nighttime
satellite is showing that coastal stratus is hugging the
coastline with slight inland intrusion around Pt Reyes, SF, and
along the SF Peninsula. However to the south, Monterey Bay remains
fairly clear as the coastal stratus sits offshore from the Bay
and the Big Sur coast. Although, there are a few small patches of
stratus developing around Monterey and Castroville that should
fill in as we get closer to sunrise.

That trough to the north is helping our onshore flow pattern with
westerly winds at the surface and southwesterly winds aloft as
shown by the 00z sounding. The onshore pressure gradient is
expected to strengthen again this afternoon bringing refreshing
breezes to coastal areas. Have kept the forecast for today`s highs
within a couple of degrees of yesterday as we are not expecting a
huge change until the marine layer deepens more. Expect mid 80s
to mid 90s inland...with a few triple digit readings at our
typical hot spots like Parkfield at the southern end of our CWA.
Meanwhile, areas along the coast and near the Bays will range in
the 60s to low 80s.

.LONG TERM...
(Wednesday through Monday)
Issued at 238 AM PDT Tue Jul 25 2023

The synoptic pattern doesn`t change much this week. High pressure
will continue to be the dominant heat maker for the southern US as
the center wobbles near the 4 Corners region. Meanwhile, the upper
level low over western Canada will track inland only to be
followed by another low that will maintain a persistent trough
pattern for our region through the end of the week into early next
week.

For the work week, daytime highs should only oscillate by a few
degrees as onshore flow continues. It looks like the trough will
have a little stronger influence by the end of the week as 500 mb
heights lower in our region. Thus, we could see a subtle cooling
trend in that timeframe.

An interesting sidenote: The forecast for overnight LOWS in Death
Valley this week will range 93 to 100...which is close to the
general range we should see for our far inland daytime HIGHS. We
are fortunate that our overnight lows will generally be in the 50s
at lower elevations with 60s in the hills.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 444 AM PDT Tue Jul 25 2023

Predominately VFR for all terminals but satellite currently shows
stratus lingering off the coast and patches of stratus forming
near some of the terminals. A bit of uncertainty on whether or not
the stratus will build over some of the coastal terminals due to
some models conflicts and recent change of weather pattern. If
stratus continues to build, North Bay may experience LIFR
visibility and ceilings in the early morning hours along with MVFR
CIGs over KOAK. Expect all terminals to return to VFR by 16-17z.
The marine layer is expected to deepen later today, which will
help bring MVFR ceilings for Monterey Bay and KOAK tonight.
Onshore winds are expected to increase this afternoon then return
to light to moderate tonight with gusty winds near coastal gaps.

Vicinity of SFO...VFR with high confidence that FEW/SCT clouds will
pass over the terminal. Some models suggest IFR ceilings building
late tonight, but had low confidence to include in TAF. Will
continue to monitor for any changes needed to the TAFs. Onshore
gusty winds up to 25 kts is expected near the afternoon with winds
decreasing later tonight.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...VFR conditions currently but expected to
become IFR as the stratus is anticipated to fill in this morning.
As the sun starts to rise, the stratus will start to mix out back
to VFR near 16Z. Stratus is expected to return tonight but low
confidence on ceiling height and timing.

.MARINE...
(Today through Sunday)
Issued at 238 AM PDT Tue Jul 25 2023

Fresh to strong northwest winds continue over the local waters
through the middle part of the week. Gale to near-gale force
gusts are possible near favored coastal jet regions such as the
Big Sur coast. Wind waves will create hazardous conditions for
small craft operators. Light southerly swell persists through the
week, with a northwest swell arriving towards midweek.
