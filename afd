.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 336 AM PST Mon Feb 5 2024

The widespread rain has thinned, but individual showers and storms
continue to make their way across the CWA, causing threats of
localized flooding, increased winds, and some lightning. Less
impactful weather expected Tuesday on.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 336 AM PST Mon Feb 5 2024

This is the tail end of our bomb cyclone event. Bomb, meaning the
intensity of the low pressure, not bomb meaning awesome, like the
night shift forecasting team. The evening shift provided a good
explainer for this:

"..WPC analysis puts the low at 978mb and msas/laps data is about
980mb. Last time there was a low this deep off the Bay Area coast
was Jan 2010. For those keeping score, it also looks like it reached
"bomb" status as it deepened 19-21 mb in 24 hours. Given that the
low is still spinning off the coast strong winds continue to impact
the region.. with widespread showers/isolated thunderstorms."

And impact they did, and are. The night shift has been mostly in
radar/hydro/lightning watch mode. More impactful storms have been
sparking up, causing lightning over San Mateo Co and some localized
flooding along some of the coastal areas. Storms continue to form in
the marine environment and move overland and look to do so through
the afternoon before storm chances reduce.

River flooding continues to be a risk into the late morning, but
some river rise rates have begun to ease. Expect additional
assessments from the local River Forecast Center in the mid morning.

The hazardous winds are reducing and the Wind Warnings and
Advisories will be allowed to expire in the mid morning.

Rain potentially returns by early Thursday morning with no
significant impacts expected at this time. Drier conditions return
