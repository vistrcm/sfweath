...New AVIATION...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 200 PM PDT Wed Aug 9 2023

Seasonably cool temperatures will persist through Friday. Mid-
level moisture associated with the remnants of former Tropical
Cyclone Eugene will approach the region on Thursday into Friday.
Small rain chances are possible for the Central Coast but
confidence is low. High pressure and warmer temperatures return
over the weekend into early next week.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 303 AM PDT Thu Aug 10 2023

Interesting weather occuring through the short term with stratus
quo on one hand and increasing upper level moisture with
thunderstorm chances on the other hand.

Looking at the overnight satellite fog shows a stratus quo type of
pattern over the Bay Area and Central Coast. Widespread clouds
once again blanket the coastal waters, coast, and inland valleys.
The depth of the marine layer is in the 1,500 to 2,000 foot
range, which is on par with the last few days. While there are
less bucket tips overnight, a few automated gauges still measured
a few a hundredth or two. Therefore, drizzle remains in the
forecast through this morning. Do expect the marine layer to
slowly erode back to the coast mid to late morning. Temperatures
will be similar to or just a bit above Wednesday, especially away
from the coast. Highs 60s/70s coast/bays and 70s/80s inland
today.

The bigger weather item at play for today will be the much talked
about moisture associated with former Tropical Storm Eugene.
Latest PWAT satellite imagery puts the bulk of the moisture off
the SoCal Coast, but the leading edge of higher PWATs (should be
1" plus this afternoon) are already starting to enter the Central
Coast. This northward progression is in part thanks to a
developing upper low off the coast. The cyclonic flow around the
upper low is helping to advect moisture northward. What happens
with said moisture is the lower confidence portion of the
forecast. Latest hi-res models, ensembles/CAMs, still generate
showers and possibly thunderstorms (15%) initially over S
Monterey/San Benito today. Even some of the more coarse global
models are showing upper level instability too. The latest trend
has been to delay the onset of showers/storms until this afternoon
and the forecast will reflect this trend.For what it is worth the
KVBX radar is already picking up a few showers over the LA region
and Channel Islands. Wet vs Dry? Soundings still suggest
initially dry with a mix of wet/dry as more upper level moisture
increases over the region. The chance for showers and possibly
storms will persist into Thursday night. What`s interesting is
this is all at higher levels so stratus/marine layer will still
remain and move inland again tonight.

.LONG TERM...
(Friday through Wednesday)
Issued at 340 AM PDT Thu Aug 10 2023

Nearby upper low and upper level moisture will provide a chance
for showers over the Central Coast to the South Bay through
Friday afternoon. Showers will diminish by Friday evening.
Not much change in temperatures for Friday compare to Thursday.

Warmer conditions are on track for the weekend, especially away
from the coast. The upper low will continue wobble overhead
through the weekend, which will keep night/morning low
clouds/fog/drizzle in place. Despite the lingering marine layer
temperatures away from the coast will warm into the 80s and 90s
with far interior spots shooting for triple digit heat. Heat Risk
concerns only reach Moderate given time of year and some cooling
at night.

One newer development for early next week: The wobbling upper low
remains and will provide an easterly fetch aloft. Some of the
longer range guidance shows the easterly winds aloft advecting
upper level moisture westward over the region. Still low
confidence at this point, but if the trend continues we may be
talking about additional showers and possible storms Monday and
Tuesday. Stay tuned...

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 458 AM PDT Thu Aug 10 2023

Satellite imagery shows stratus blanketing much of the region,
bringing MVFR ceilings to most terminals, with the exception of
Monterey Bay where terminals are currently reporting LIFR
conditions. General expectation is that stratus begins to mix out
leading to VFR conditions towards the late morning hours, 16-18Z,
again with the exception of Monterey Bay who is likely to see
later clearing in the afternoon. Current light onshore winds
expected to increase to become breezy to moderate (12-15knots) and
gusty near coastal gaps in the afternoon today, then weakening
into the night just as stratus begins to make a return, and
therefore MVFR- IFR ceilings.


Vicinity of SFO...Currently reporting VFR at the KSFO terminal,
though models continue to indicate the development of an MVFR
ceiling this morning. Satellite shows the terminal well surrounded
by stratus, with a clear hole almost directly above. Best
confidence is in a brief and temporary MVFR ceiling before 14Z,
therefore have included a tempo group. Beyond 14Z, expecting VFR
to prevail. Westerly winds redevelop into the afternoon with
gusts up to 20 knots. Towards the evening, current thought is that
stratus makes an early return, though scattered. Moderate
confidence in stratus continuing to build into the late night,
with MVFR ceilings developing towards the early morning hours of
Friday.


SFO Bridge Approach...Scattered stratus currently in the approach,
but otherwise similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...IFR-LIFR persists with clearing to VFR not
expected until the late afternoon for KMRY. Clearing expected in
the late morning for KSNS. Most confidence is in late clearing
for KMRY, and only brief VFR conditions before stratus makes an
early return in the evening, reducing conditions to IFR. West to
northwest winds developing in the afternoon with speeds up to
10-12 knots.

.MARINE...
(Today through Tuesday)
Issued at 303 AM PDT Thu Aug 10 2023

Breezy northwesterly winds continue, with gusty conditions
expected to develop over the San Francisco Bay, Delta, and
northern immediate coast in the afternoon today before
diminishing into the night. Moderate period southerly swell at 12
to 14 seconds continues and will gradually increase into Friday,
in addition to short period wind waves. A new light and moderate
period northerly swell train begins today. A few showers are
possible Thursday and Friday, especially over the southern waters.

.MTR WATCHES/WARNINGS/ADVISORIES...

     evening for PZZ530-540.
