...New UPDATE...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 146 AM PDT Sat Nov 4 2023

A regime change is in store with cooler, cloudier weather and a
few rounds of light rain through Tuesday.

&&

.UPDATE...
Issued at 637 AM PDT Sat Nov 4 2023

Dense fog has developed over the North Bay Valleys and a Dense Fog
Advisory is in effect through 10 AM this morning. No other changes
to the forecast.

&&

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 146 AM PDT Sat Nov 4 2023

A cold front is currently approaching far NW California, with
the Eureka Radar picking up a few rounds of light rain near the
CA/OR border. The forecast has continued to slow the progression
of this feature and it now looks like Friday will stay mostly dry.
Cloud cover will gradually increase through the day, keeping the
afternoon slightly cooler than Friday. Rain is now expected to
hold off until after mid-night for the majority of the Bay Area
south of Santa Rosa.

&&

.LONG TERM...
(Sunday through Friday)
Issued at 146 AM PDT Sat Nov 4 2023

Sunday through Tuesday:

Rain will start in the North Bay overnight Saturday and push
south, reaching San Francisco and Oakland by mid-morning Sunday,
and the Monterey Bay by late afternoon. This will be the first of
several disturbances that will bring periods of light rain through
Tuesday. The latest total expected accumulation from these
systems has increased a bit with about 1/2 inch expected in the
North Bay, 1/4 inch in the SF Peninsula, South Bay, East Bay, and
Santa Cruz County, and 1/10 inch in Monterey and San Benito
counties. In addition to the rain, temperatures will gradually
cool while cloud cover and humidity increase. Some moderate wind
gusts are possible Monday and Tuesday as a 140 kt jet max moves
directly over the Bay Area.

Wednesday and Thursday:

A fast moving short wave ridge should bring dry and clear
conditions mid-week. The cold fronts earlier in the week and
sinking jet stream will bring in a cold air mass. The current GFS
and ECMWF runs show 1000-500 mb thickness values of around 545 dm
on Wednesday. Clear skies will also help support cold mornings.
Several inland valleys are expected to drop into the upper 30s and
some isolated freezing temperatures can not be ruled out. Coastal
areas should stay in the mid 40s or so, but that could still
challenge some daily records.

Friday and beyond:

Unsettled conditions look to return as a deep cut-off low
pressure system sinks across California. This should bring a
return of more clouds and rain chances although with low
confidence in timing and amounts given model variability.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 342 AM PDT Sat Nov 4 2023

Incoming trough bringing increased moisture and a mix of clouds
across the area through the TAF period. High clouds currently
traversing across the region providing some uncertainty in exact
timing of CIG development, however, seeing a few smaller terminals
develop IFR CIGs and decreased VIS this morning. Certainly expecting
some spread of these conditions for most terminals. FG impacts
should stay mostly limited to the North Bay terminals this morning,
though can`t rule out some brief slight reductions in VIS around the
northern half of the Bay Area, as well as the Monterey Bay region.
Winds today remain onshore and mostly light to breezy this
afternoon, turning more southerly toward the end of the TAF period
with the approaching front, though expected to remain light. -RA
chances increase at the end of the TAF period as well for North Bay
terminals especially, extending southward into the Bay Area later on
Sunday.

Vicinity of SFO...Mixed skies this morning with some hint of low
clouds and ample high clouds traversing across the area. Still
expecting some degree of CIG development this morning, but
confidence is low. Clouds remain through today with mixed variations
of low and high clouds. Low clouds increase, as does confidence,
towards the end of the TAF period with the approaching front. Though
winds are more likely to be S/SE during this time, they look to
remain on the lighter side.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...As previously mentioned, high clouds
currently moving through the area providing some uncertainty in the
low cloud forecast. More confident in CIGs toward the end of the TAF
period as moisture continues to increase and the marine layer
deepens ahead of a trough.

&&

.MARINE...
(Today through Thursday)
Issued at 342 AM PDT Sat Nov 4 2023

Gentle to moderate northerly breezes will continue in the
southern waters near Big Sur coast through the weekend. Low
pressure system will bring slight rain chances to the northern
outer waters late Saturday, spreading southward across the rest of
the waters through Sunday morning. Moderate period westerly swell
is expected to build Sunday into early next week, resulting in
elevated seas that may become hazardous to small craft across the
northern waters.

&&

.MTR WATCHES/WARNINGS/ADVISORIES...
CA...Dense Fog Advisory until 10 AM PDT this morning for CAZ506.

PZ...Small Craft Advisory from 9 PM PDT this evening to 3 AM PST
     Sunday for PZZ570.
