...New AVIATION...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 158 AM PST Mon Nov 6 2023

Clearing and breezy winds today. These clear skies will bring
cold morning temperatures Wed-Thu before rain chances return
Friday. The weekend looks dry for now.

&&

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 234 AM PST Tue Nov 7 2023

A clearing sky, nocturnal radiative cooling and cool air
advection are combining to form a mix of patchy fog and low
clouds, occasionally dense fog with visibilities below 1/4 mile
are also reported. Light mixing winds and the absence of a lower
level temperature inversion (cap) should help limit the areal
extent of dense fog this morning, nonetheless will continue to
monitor in case we need to issue a dense fog advisory. With
exception of southernmost interior Monterey County, 24 hour trends
show temperatures are cooler at this early hour.

Dry upper level troughing will move southeastward across the
forecast area today. Most locations are forecast to have daytime
highs in the 60s today. Lows tonight and Wednesday morning will
vary from the 30s far inland valleys to mainly the 40s to lower
50s elsewhere, mildest at the bays and coast.

&&

.LONG TERM...
(Wednesday through Monday)
Issued at 234 AM PST Tue Nov 7 2023

Good forecast model agreement shows dry weather prevailing mid
week to early next week with exception of a weakening trough
bringing a little light rain from the North Bay to the San
Francisco Peninsula late Thursday night and Friday morning.
Forecast highs will climb a little with a mix of 60s to lower to
mid 70s for mid-week to early next week. Night-time and morning
lows chilliest late week with 30s far inland valleys to mainly the
40s to near 50 elsewhere. There`s a fair amount of uncertainty as
to where over the eastern Pacific a long wave trough develops
next week (beyond 120 hours) thus precipitation forecast timing
and amounts is a very low confidence forecast at this point in
time.
