.UPDATE...
Issued at 842 AM PST Wed Feb 4 2026

It`s largely a Ctrl+C, Ctrl+V kind of morning per GOES-West
visible imagery with abundant sunshine for most Bay Area
communities, with the exception in the Delta region and portions
along San Pablo Bay shoreline with Tule Fog. Temperatures are
generally running within a few degrees of where they were this
time yesterday. Expect a repeat of well-above normal temperatures
this afternoon along with a few communities within striking
distance of daily record highs. Please refer to the climate
section for details on record highs for the day. No forecast
updates planned for the morning; things remain on track.

.SHORT TERM...
Issued at 156 AM PST Wed Feb 4 2026
(Today and tonight)

A strong ridge of high pressure and light offshore winds will
bring warm temperatures and dry conditions once again to the area
today. Most areas will see their warmest temperatures of this warm
pattern today, reaching the upper 60s to mid 70s near the coast,
and 70s to near 80 inland. A few spots will approach record high
temperatures for the date with highs around 10 to as much as 20
degrees above normal. See the CLIMATE section below for relevant
record high temperatures for today. Outside of areas of fog in
the North and East Bay valleys, as well as the southern Salinas
Valley this morning, skies will be mostly clear. Patchy fog will
redevelop tonight in similar areas to this morning.

&&

.LONG TERM...
Issued at 156 AM PST Wed Feb 4 2026
(Thursday through Tuesday)

The upper level ridge bringing us warm and dry conditions will
gradually move east on Thursday, allowing temperatures to cool a
couple degrees from today. A weak cutoff low will then approach
the coast and dive south off southern California and Baja
California Friday and Saturday. This will usher in the beginning
of a pattern change with temperatures cooling another 5 degrees or
so and clouds increasing.

Confidence is high that a sustained pattern change will take
place Sunday into early next week as a longwave trough sets up
along the West Coast. However, confidence in the details
(timing/strength) is lower. Rain chances will increase from the
north through the day Sunday, generally reaching 10-30% across the
greater SF Bay area by the afternoon and extending into the
Central Coast by the evening. Our area is likely to be on the
southern fringe of the trough, resulting in very light amounts
from any rainfall with this initial activity.

Precipitation chances remain elevated Monday and Tuesday
as the trough along the coast deepens, opening the door for
additional systems to move through. The trend toward a deeper
trough brings better potential for higher rainfall amounts, but
totals are still favored to be light to moderate. This pattern
will bring much cooler temperatures, dipping a few degrees below
normal by early next week. Periods of breezy winds will also
develop.
