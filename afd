.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 111 AM PST Sun Feb 18 2024

A strong storm will arrive today. Rain will begin around mid-day
and will be heavy through the night. Moderate to major impacts
from this storm will last into Monday with heavy rain, strong
winds, high surf, thunderstorms and flooding potential.
Conditions improve Tuesday, but lingering showers and residual
flooding are possible.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 111 AM PST Sun Feb 18 2024

The weather conditions will be drastically different from Sunday
morning to Sunday night. A small high pressure ridge managed to
build in between Saturday`s cold front and the incoming storm.
This is supporting clear skies and a gentle to moderate breeze.
High cloud coverage will increase through the morning and the
window of dry conditions will last through mid-day or so before
the rain starts to fall and the southerly winds pick up. Conditions
will continue to deteriorate through the afternoon and evening
with heavy rain expected all night.

This is all driven by a storm force low pressure system currently
located roughly 800 miles west of San Fransico, moving NE at
20-25 mph. Satellite observations confirmed this storm is
currently producing a significant amount of lightning, 60 mph
winds, and up to 30 ft seas. The low pressure center is in the
process of decoupling from the jet stream, which will cause the
cyclongensis to stall and slow the forward motion. As the storm
continues to lose jet support over the next 24 hours, it will
stall off the coast of northern California. This set up will cause
southwesterly flow to pump tropical moisture over the Bay Area.
The Center for Western Weather and Water Extremes is labeling this
a level 2 Atmospheric River with a maximum integrated water vapor
transport of 533 kg/m/s and a 30 hour duration above 250 kg/m/s.
The scale goes to 5, and according to the research, level 2 ARs
generally do not cause major flooding of large rivers. However,
with high rain rates Sunday night, urban areas, as well as small
creeks and streams are susceptible to flooding. In fact, we saw
very strong responses from Saturday`s rain in river gauges,
indicating that the soils are saturated and runoff will be
efficient. The rain on Sunday is driven by a warm front and will
therefore by mostly steady stratiform in nature.

Winds will also be a threat Sunday, with strong southerly winds
peaking in the late afternoon or early evening. Gusts are expected
to reach 30 to 45 mph with stronger winds near the coast and at
higher elevations. Adding rain and wind to already saturated soils
brings the potential for downed trees, power outages, and shallow
land slides.

.LONG TERM...
(Monday through Saturday)
Issued at 111 AM PST Sun Feb 18 2024

Monday will bring another round of impactful weather. The low
pressure system will be weaker, but also closer to the coast. This
will cause another round of strong southerly winds. It also looks
more likely that a cold front will move through Monday afternoon
or evening. Compared to the widespread rain from the warm front
on Sunday, the cold front will bring more scattered showers. Some
of these showers will be strong and could form into thunderstorms.
In fact, the Storm Prediction Center has upgraded their convective
outlook from marginal to slight for the Sacramento Valley,
indicating a chance for severe winds or an isolated tornado. This
convective outlook area covers the eastern portion of Contra Costa
and Alameda counties, while the rest of the Bay Area is under a
general thunderstorm outlook.

By Tuesday, the low will push north towards the Pacific Northwest,
leaving the Bay Area with only residual impacts. Winds will
be moderate in the morning and decrease through the day. Any
lingering rain will be light to moderate. The gradual improvement
will continue into Wednesday, with showers tapering off through
the day. Thursday looks dry, but that`s all I can say for now.
There`s some indication rain may return to the forecast on Friday
and continue through next weekend. Currently, this next event
looks to bring lighter, more beneficial type rain.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 341 AM PST Sun Feb 18 2024

Today will be challenging for aviators as a large Pacific storm
heads towards California. While the window was small, fog was
able to take advantage of the clear skies and high moisture
overnight. STS and APC are the only TAF sites currently affected,
but there is dense fog also being reported at smaller airports in
the North and East Bay, and the coverage is growing. As the storm
approaches, winds will steadily increase through the morning,
which should help quickly mix out the fog. For stations that
manage to stay clear through sunrise, there is a window of VFR in
the morning before the ceilings drop and the rain starts.
Southerly winds will steadily increase through the morning hours.
Even sites with terrain shelter will be dealing with low-level
shear induced turbulence from strong southerly winds aloft. By
the afternoon, rain will be falling, with the intensity ramping up
through the overnight hours. Looking ahead, similar winds with
more convective type rain is in store Monday.

Vicinity of SFO...VFR in the morning before VFR-MVFR ceilings,
rain and strong low-level wind shear take over in the afternoon.
Rain rates will increase through the evening and will be heavy at
times overnight.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...Similar to the other terminals with VFR
conditions early and lower ceilings, strong winds, and moderate rain
in the afternoon. SNS recorded a wind gusts of 43 KT yesterday,
and may be stronger today. Rain will be heavy at times overnight.

.MARINE...
(Today through Friday)
Issued at 341 AM PST Sun Feb 18 2024

A storm force low is moving towards the coast and will cause
hazardous marine conditions to continue for several days. Buoys
are currently reporting very rough seas in a westerly swell.  As
the storm approaches, winds will increase to a strong  southerly
breeze this afternoon with frequent gusts to gale force. While the
swell will gradually abate, the strong winds will keep  conditions
very rough. Significant wave heights of 12-18 feet are expected
through Tuesday.

&&

.BEACHES...
Issued at 1000 AM PST Sat Feb 17 2024

A high surf advisory is in effect through 4 AM Tuesday.

Incoming large westerly is causing large breaking waves of 18 to
22 feet along exposed, west- facing beaches. Locally higher waves
of 28 feet are possible along some favored areas with steep
beaches. In addition to the westerly swell, strong southerly winds
will enhance the energy in the surf zone, creating dangerous
conditions for surfers and swimmers. Inexperienced swimmer should
remain out of the water. All beachgoers are strongly encouraged to
respect the power of the ocean and reminded to never turn their
back to the water. Large waves can sweep across the beach without
warning, pulling people into the sea from rocks, jetties, and
beaches. These waves can also move large objects such as logs,
crushing anyone caught underneath.

.HYDROLOGY...
Issued at 1000 AM PST Sat Feb 17 2024

A flood watch is in effect from 10 AM Sunday through 10 AM
Wednesday. Excessive runoff may result in flooding of rivers,
creeks, streams, and other low-lying and flood-prone locations.
Creeks and streams may rise out of their banks. Flooding may occur
in poor drainage and urban areas. While most main stem rivers are
forecast to remain below flood stage, minor flooding in urban
areas and along smaller creeks and streams is expected. A flood
watch means flooding is possible. Monitor the latest alerts for
possible flood warnings.

Soil moisture remains high from previous storms earlier this
month and will reach saturation this weekend. Once saturated,
additional rainfall will runoff resulting in moderate to rapid
rises on our creeks, streams, and rivers, as well as lead to
nuisance and/or minor flooding. The current ensemble guidance
from the CNRFC indicates the Russian River at Guerneville and the
San Lorenzo River at Big Trees have about a 20% chance of reaching
flood stage in the next 5 days, while the Salinas River at
Spreckels and Pajaro River at Chittenden will be slower to crest
and have about a 15% chance of reaching flood stage. Although
most sites are forecast to remain below flood stage, some
locations may reach monitor stage or minor flood stage.

USGS instrumentation throughout the San Francisco Bay Area
indicates that shallow soils on steep hillsides are approaching
saturation. This coupled with the forecasted precipitation means
shallow landslides are possible. Expect localized ponding of
water in low-lying or poorly drained areas, such as freeway
offramps.
