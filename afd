Warm and dry conditions continue to prevail.

.UPDATE...
Issued at 846 AM PST Thu Dec 5 2024

Biggest news in the near term - KMUX radar was switched to precip
mode. The shortwave trough referenced below is actually
generating a few showers, which are being picked up on radar.
However, looking at the KOAK sounding it`s rather dry in the lower
levels. Therefore, these are less likely to reach the ground and
more likely virga. Haven`t see any public reports of rain showers
over the North Bay this morning. Latest hi-res guidance keeps a
few of these showers through mid morning before fading.

Otherwise, no updates needed this morning.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 216 AM PST Thu Dec 5 2024

Let`s take a trip up to 500 millibars, shall we? This level shows us
a Rex Block with high pressure over the Northern Great Basin and low
pressure over the Desert Southwest. The combination of subsiding air
and light surface winds will allow for stagnant conditions, thus
haze/smoke from a prescribed burn east of Napa is to be expected.
A shortwave trough can also be seen bringing mid-to-high level
clouds into the West Coast. These clouds will limit the amount of
solar radiation, thus temperatures are expected to be slightly
cooler compared to yesterday and what they are expected to be
tomorrow, albeit still above average. These clouds will also allow
for less longwave radiation to be emitted, so while patchy dense
fog still remains possible during the overnight periods, it is
expected to be in even less extent than what was observed last
night. If you encounter fog: turn on your low-beam headlights,
drive slowly, and keep your distance from other vehicles. While
too young to be a climate site (less than 30 years old), STS
reached 69 degrees, tying the record for daily maximum temperature
on December 4th previously set in 2020.

.LONG TERM...
(Friday through Wednesday)
Issued at 216 AM PST Thu Dec 5 2024

Friday will be the warmest day of the week with clear skies and the
Rex Block doing what it does best: block. A second, stronger
shortwave trough will help flatten the ridge and in turn force the
low pressure system that has been lingering in the Desert Southwest
out making the longwave pattern progressive again. PoPs (
