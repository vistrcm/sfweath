...New AVIATION, MARINE...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 155 PM PDT Tue Jun 18 2024

Upper level trough will dig over California through midweek, with
breezy onshore winds continuing and temperatures near seasonal
averages prevailing through Thursday. The trough will remain in
place, but weaken for Friday and the weekend, with warmer
conditions developing once again across the inland areas.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 102 AM PDT Wed Jun 19 2024

Generally clear so far tonight with some patchy stratus near Half
Moon Bay and around the southern Monterey Bay region. An upper level
trough is digging into the region, helping to promote an expanding
marine layer today. Low temperatures this morning range from the mid
40s to the mid 50s across the lower elevations, perhaps near 60 in
the higher elevations. High temperatures are expected to cool a few
degrees from yesterday across most of the region, helped by breezy
onshore flow this afternoon. High temperatures range from the mid
50s to lower 60s along the coast, the mid 60s to lower 70s in the
Bayshore, and the upper 70s to mid 80s in the inland valleys.

&&

.LONG TERM...
(Thursday through Tuesday)
Issued at 102 AM PDT Wed Jun 19 2024

Thursday should be a little warmer across the region as the upper
level trough begins to erode and fill in, with temperatures in the
inland regions rising by a few degrees. More dramatic warming is
expected by Friday as the trough continues to erode, and a ridge
begins to build across the Intermountain West. The warmest
temperatures are expected on Saturday, where highs will range from
the 90s to lower 100s for the inland regions, the mid 70s to low 80s
for the Bayshore, and the low to mid 60s for the coast. Model
ensembles suggest that the ridge stays in place through the early
part of next week, with warm conditions continuing inland. CPC
outlooks suggest that temperatures above seasonal averages, and
precipitation around or below the seasonal average, continue into
the beginning of July.
