...New AVIATION...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 1202 AM PST Mon Feb 17 2025

Relatively benign weather through Tuesday before another
cold front moves through on Wednesday. This system will bring light
rain to the North Bay, and strong winds to the coast and higher
elevations. A warming trend will begin late week before a beautiful
weekend.

&&

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 1202 AM PST Mon Feb 17 2025

A weak cold front has pushed through the Bay Area and will
dissipate over southern California today. Behind this system a
low amplitude ridge will start to build Monday. Morning
temperatures will generally be typical for this time of year with
low 40s inland and upper 40s along the coast. With 850 mb
temperatures around normal (5C), but some lingering cloud cover,
afternoon temperatures will be a few degrees below normal.
Overall, it will be a pretty typical February day.

&&

.LONG TERM...
(Tuesday through Sunday)
Issued at 1202 AM PST Mon Feb 17 2025

The ridge will continue through Tuesday, with continued
benign weather. Another cold front will move through Wednesday.
similar to Sunday, the rain will be light and mainly confined to the
North Bay. The pattern is a little different, however. A jet streak
will move over the Bay Area, and the surface low will be off the
Oregon coast, rather than the Gulf of Alaska. At 500 mb, a sharp
trough/cut-off will move through with winds around 80 kts. With
these dynamics and a cold, marginally unstable air mass, it`s
likely that a good portion of this momentum will make translate to
strong winds at the surface. Gusts up to 40 mph are possible
along the coast and in higher terrain. The models have backed off
a bit on the winds since yesterday, and we`ve dropped to about a
10% chance of wind advisory criteria based on NBM probabilities.
By this time tomorrow the local WRF will extend far enough to
capture the event, and we`ll have a better idea of the wind
threat. A warming trend kicks off late week, leading to an
absolutely beautiful weekend with temperatures in the upper 60s
along the coast and mid 70s inland. Time to pump up the soccer
ball, dust of the bikes, and find your sunglasses!

.MARINE...
(Today through Saturday)
Issued at 224 AM PST Mon Feb 17 2025

Moderate west-northwest swell builds to 10 to 12 feet today. Rough
seas and locally gusty winds, particularly along the Big Sur coast,
are expected to continue through early Tuesday morning. Waves and
winds briefly ease before long to moderate period northwest swell
returns mid to late week.

.BEACHES...
Issued at 243 AM PST Mon Feb 17 2025

Moderate west swell 10 to 11 feet at 15 seconds will arrive along
our coast beginning early this morning, swell periods are forecast
to decrease to 14 seconds early Tuesday morning. This will bring
breaking waves generally between 10 to 15 feet with occasional
breaking waves up to 18 feet possible. At this time a beach hazards
statement is not warranted, however surf conditions will be closely
monitored through early week. As always, if going to the beach
especially during increased surf, it`s important to be vigilant
and never turn your back on the ocean.
