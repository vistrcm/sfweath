.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 315 AM PDT Mon Sep 18 2023

A seasonably mild weather pattern will continue at least through
Wednesday with mostly cloudy nights and sunny days. A system will
pass to our east Thursday bringing a slight cool down and some
breezy winds in the hills. High pressure rebuilds Friday into
next weekend with sunny and seasonably warm weather continuing.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 351 AM PDT Mon Sep 18 2023

Areas of low clouds and patchy fog are redeveloping in residual
lower level cool air advection including modest night-time cooling
to space since water vapor is still elevated (precipitable water
0.99" on last evening`s Oakland upper air sounding, near 90th
percentile for mid September). Lower level cool air advection with
the closed 500 mb low 400 miles southwest of the Bay Area weakened
the lower level temperature inversion, however lower level
temperatures begin to gradually warm again today and tonight.
Statistical guidance has bumped up forecast highs today by at
least a couple degrees. Went ahead and adjusted today`s forecast
highs a few degrees most places except along the southern Monterey
Bay where residual cooling may last longest today. Daytime highs
today upper 60s to mid 70s coastside, 70s to lower 80s bayside and
lower to mid 80s far inland. Lows tonight in the 50s to near 60,
mildest near the water, except far inland valleys cooling to the
upper 40s.

.LONG TERM...
(Tuesday through Sunday)
Issued at 351 AM PDT Mon Sep 18 2023

Stratus and patchy fog redeveloping tonight and Tuesday morning
with the marine layer temperature inversion gradually redeveloping,
particularly over the North Bay. Clearing returns back to the
coastline later Tuesday morning and afternoon. For Tuesday into
Wednesday the 500 mb low to our southwest will slowly move
eastward reaching Point Conception Wednesday. By Wednesday morning
and lasting through Wednesday night surface pressures begin
lowering since a newly advancing 500 mb low to our north will
arrive with increasing cyclonic flow, a continental influence with
lowering precipitable water. However, a focus of lower level cool
air advection and upslope southwesterly winds develop from the
Santa Cruz Mountains to the Big Sur Coast late Wednesday night and
Thursday morning. The NBM does not forecast light precipitation,
but the ECMWF, GFS and wet biased NAM do show light measurable
precipitation, a few hundredths to less than 0.10" rain. Elsewhere
over land surface to lower level mainly weak cyclonic winds
temporarily develop with a reflection of the 500 mb low at the
surface over our forecast area. The 500 mb low over Point Conception
and the primary low over northern CA/NV and the Great Basin merge
Thursday and eject eastward Friday.

A strong zonal polar jet stream passes across the southern Aleutian
Islands late this week, a perturbation in the flow transforming
energy to a developing low pressure system over the eastern Pacific.
500 mb ridging with 580-585 decameter heights develop over our
forecast area. Dry weather and warmer temperatures redeveloping
over forecast area this weekend. However, early next week if the
500 mb ridge weakens sufficiently (lowering below 580 decameter
heights), warm air advection may bring the North Bay a little
light measurable rain.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 422 AM PDT Mon Sep 18 2023

Patchy stratus coverage this morning with several locations
experiencing MVFR cigs. Isolated FG impacts this morning for
inland areas of the North Bay, contributing to IFR/LIFR vis/cigs.
Ample marine layer mixing through today as an upper trough spins
off the coast. This will help clear any lingering stratus out
through the morning hours, giving way to VFR for the rest of the
day.

Vicinity of SFO...Current satellite showing solid stratus coverage
over most of the SF Bay this morning. Changes from previous
issuance include holding prevailing stratus through about the 16Z
hour as opposed to a TEMPO group. Expecting a solid clearing to
VFR through the late morning and afternoon with breezy onshore
flow through the San Bruno gap 15-25 kts.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...Cloud cover filling in most of the
Monterey Bay region, sparing terminals on the southern side of the
bay. Expecting mostly clear through the morning with a slight
chance of intermittent MVFR cigs through mid-morning. Otherwise
clearing to VFR through the rest of the day with breezy onshore
flow.

.MARINE...
(Tonight through next Friday)
Issued at 242 AM PDT Mon Sep 18 2023

Light to moderate breezes continue across the waters through
this afternoon. Light southerly swell and moderate northwesterly
swell will continue today before a longer period northwesterly
swell train arrives Tuesday. Fresh to strong northerly winds will
begin to build across the waters Tuesday afternoon before
diminishing late Thursday morning. As a result of the strong
breezes, seas are expected to be rough, with the northern outer
waters expected to develop near-gale force winds.

.MTR WATCHES/WARNINGS/ADVISORIES...
CA...None.
PZ...Small Craft Advisory from 3 AM Tuesday to 3 PM PDT Wednesday for
     PZZ570.
