...New UPDATE, MARINE...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 318 AM PST Wed Jan 1 2025

A system slides just to our north today and may clip the North Bay
counties with light rainshowers. Next chance for widespread rain
looks to be on Friday, with dry weather expected for the weekend
and into next week.

.UPDATE...
Issued at 851 AM PST Wed Jan 1 2025

KMUX radar is showing scattered echoes across Sonoma and Napa
counties, but observation stations in the region have not reported
any precipitation, making this a likely case of virga (rain
evaporating before reaching the ground). With rising temperatures
this morning, and warmer lows expected tonight and Thursday
morning, the Frost Advisory has been allowed to expire. No changes
to the forecast at this time.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 318 AM PST Wed Jan 1 2025

The blanket of clouds have kept us insulated this morning, meaning
temperatures haven`t fallen as expected. Observations for the North
Bay have flirted mostly with the low to mid 40s so far, where as
some East Bay locations have started to dip into the upper 30s.
Farther south, into San Benito and interior southern Monterey
counties, temperatures are more on track ranging between the upper
30s to low 40s. Given these conditions, opted to cancel the Frost
Advisories for the North and East Bay, while keeping it for San
Benito and Monterey. Should temperatures recover quickly this
morning, the dayshift may be able to end the lingering Frost
Advisory early.

In terms of the rest of the New Year forecast, light rain showers
will clip the North Bay counties. Elsewhere, look for dry
conditions with a mix of sun and clouds. Highs for the start of
the New Year look to be in the low to mid 50s for the North Bay,
the mid 50s to low 60s for the rest of the Bay Area, and in the
low to mid 60s for much of the Central Coast.

.LONG TERM...
(Thursday through Tuesday)
Issued at 318 AM PST Wed Jan 1 2025

Zonal flow builds to weak ridging for Thursday; however, this will
be short lived as some disturbances over the Gulf of Alaska and
eastern Pacific strengthened, merge, and truck eastward. Guidance has
these systems moving into either the PacNW or northern California
Friday. This should bring widespread rainfall to the region, with
the highest amounts being found over the Bay Area and perhaps along
the Santa Cruz and Santa Lucia mountains. Dry weather is expected
for the weekend and to continue into next week. Ensemble and
cluster analysis shows ridging holding through the second week of
January.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 437 AM PST Wed Jan 1 2025

It`s VFR except for a few patches of fog /LIFR-VLIFR/ developing
in the North Bay this morning. Satellite imagery shows mid and
high clouds continuing to arrive from the west through an upper
level ridge of high pressure. With a low sun angle and increasing
clouds it may take until late morning for the fog to mix out in
the North Bay. Otherwise it`ll largely be VFR for the remaining
forecast area today and tonight, however with exception of the
North Bay the HREF and WRF output show increasing low clouds /IFR/
conditions (in addition to light rain/drizzle forecast over far
northwestern Sonoma County). For especially tonight and Thursday
morning expect an increasing probability of IFR at KSTS, which may
reach over to KAPC as well, however it`s a low confidence forecast
there and IFR is not currently indicated in the 12z KAPC TAF.

Vicinity of SFO...VFR. Light wind.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...VFR. East to southeast winds 5 to 10
knots this morning, becoming variable 3 to 5 knots late morning
and afternoon. East to southeast winds 5 to 10 knots redeveloping
tonight and Thursday morning.

.MARINE...
(Today through Monday)
Issued at 851 AM PST Wed Jan 1 2025

Mainly light winds continue across the coastal waters and bays
through Thursday night. The probability of wet weather increases
later in the week with a cold front approaching from the northwest
and the front moving across the coastal waters and bays later
Friday. Incoming moderate to long period westerly swell and
northerly breezes will create hazardous conditions Friday and into
next week.

&&

.BEACHES...
Issued at 349 AM PST Wed Jan 1 2025

Wave model forecasts indicate increasingly long period swell arriving
along the entire coastline from Sonoma County to Monterey County later
Friday and lasting into Saturday. Expect dangerous and life threatening
beach conditions beginning late week with high surf, including breakers
possibly reaching 20 to 30 feet, rip currents, sneaker waves, potentially
minor coastal flooding for all beaches. Please - remember to never turn
your back on the ocean and stay out of the water. Stay tuned for the
latest updates concerning the dangerously high surf for late week.
