...New MARINE...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 1230 AM PST Mon Jan 15 2024

Quiet weather to begin the work week as high pressure builds
overhead. A weak weather system brings some light rain towards mid
week with rain chances returning for the weekend. Temperatures
will remain seasonally mild.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 1230 AM PST Mon Jan 15 2024

Quiet weather prevails with the only concern being some overnight
and AM fog, perhaps locally dense. Otherwise look for high level
clouds to stick around with filtered sunshine boosting high
temperatures into the lower 60s across the lower elevations.
Overnight lows should be seasonally mild and mostly in the 40s.

.LONG TERM...
(Tuesday through Sunday)
Issued at 1230 AM PST Mon Jan 15 2024

Upper ridging aloft will become suppressed equatorward by mid
week as a shortwave trough treks from the Pacific Northwest into
the Four Corners region. An associated surface cold front will
sweep southeastward across the region as well bringing a chance
for mainly light rain to the Bay Area and Central Coast on Tuesday
into early Wednesday. Amounts will be modest and range from
around 1" in the North Bay Hills to less than 0.25" for inland
portions of the Central Coast. So this should be a beneficial
rainfall with little in the way of hydrologic concerns.

A shift in the upper pattern takes hold for Friday into early next
week with deep troughing evolving over the northeast Pacific. This
feature will access a subtropical moisture tap as a couple different
shortwaves impact CA into early next week. Deterministic models and
their ensembles appear consistent in bringing a soaking rain to the
area but differ somewhat in the large-scale details and timing of
the individual waves. All of this is to say that our confidence
remains high on seeing a wetter pattern later this week and into the
first portion of next. As noted the Weather Prediction Center`s
extended hazard outlook does highlight our area within a slight risk
for heavy rainfall during this time, so we`ll definitely be watching
trends. For now just be aware of the wetter pattern in store and
keep up with forecast details going forward.

Issued at 341 AM PST Mon Jan 15 2024
