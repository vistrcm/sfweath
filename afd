.UPDATE...
Issued at 839 AM PDT Thu Oct 30 2025

Satellite imagery shows stratus filling the North Bay valleys,
much of the Bay Area to the west of the Berkeley Hills, the South
Bay, and the southern Monterey Bay region, with patchy dense fog
observed across the North Bay valleys and near Salinas. Drivers
who encounter dense fog should slow down, use low-beam
headlights, and allow extra space between them and the car in
front. The last few satellite frames have shown the stratus deck
continuing to expand, but it is expected to dissipate as the sun
continues to rise and warm the region. Beyond the morning, some
mid- to high-level clouds are possible across the Bay Area this
afternoon.

.SHORT TERM...
Issued at 303 AM PDT Thu Oct 30 2025
(Today and tonight)

Bit of a change compared to the last two nights for any night owls,
the approaching shortwave trough is allowing the marine layer to
deepen with widespread stratus developing over the marine
environment. Stratus and fog are possible along the coastline and
across the North Bay Interior Valleys this morning. A dry cold front
will pass through the Bay Area today and bring cooler, more seasonal
temperatures to the region. This will be a fairly noticeable
difference with high temperatures running anywhere between 5 to 10
degrees cooler today than yesterday. Interior high temperatures will
be in the low to mid 70s, upper 60s to low 70s along the bay
shoreline, and in the upper 50s to 60s along the coastline.
Temperatures will remain warmer across the interior Central Coast
where highs will be in the low to mid 80s. Light offshore flow
continues across the interior mountain ranges with winds to become
onshore by this afternoon. Winds strengthen across the marine
environment today with breezy afternoon winds along the coastline
and within valleys.

.LONG TERM...
Issued at 303 AM PDT Thu Oct 30 2025
(Friday through Wednesday)

Upper level ridging and high pressure return Friday and bring warmer
temperatures back to the Bay Area. High temperatures will be in the
mid 70s to low 80s across the interior while coastal areas stay in
the upper 50s to mid 60s. Temperatures cool slightly Monday as the
center of the upper level ridge progresses eastward and an upper
level trough approaches from the west. High temperatures across the
interior on Monday will generally be in the 70s while coastal areas
stay in the 60s. Temperatures drop more noticeably, as the trough
arrives, Tuesday and Wednesday with interior high temperatures
dropping into the 60s to low 70s and coastal areas in the upper 50s
to 60s. Given the pleasant fall weekend on tap, it would be a good
time to make sure any outdoors items are secured and gutters are
clear ahead of next weeks potential rain event.

There is still a fair amount of uncertainty regarding our incoming
system. First off, guidance has remained consistent in showing a
deep upper level trough extending into the Bay Area and Central
Coast arriving next week. However, guidance has pushed back the
arrival of the trough from Monday/Tuesday to Tuesday/Wednesday. This
makes Monday more of a transition day from upper level ridging to
upper level troughing rather than the first day of our next system.
Ensemble members are leaning towards the bulk of this system taking
place Wednesday/Thursday so we may see further adjustments to the
timing of this system as it gets closer. Both the ECMWF and GFS are
coming on board that the Bay Area and Central Coast will see
precipitation early to mid next week but uncertainty remains as to
how much we will see. Ensemble guidance continues to show a split
between "boom" (moderate amount of rain) vs "bust" (little rain)
scenarios. For example, using the 00Z 30th October GFS run, out of
30 ensemble members 14 members show the Santa Rosa Airport receiving
greater than 1 inch of rain in 24 hours while 16 show it receiving
less than an inch of rain in 24 hours. Ensemble guidance from the
ECMWF shows a similar split between members showing higher
precipitation totals vs lower precipitation totals. We will start
to see a better consensus on precipitation totals as this system
approaches and the timing/track of the system come into better
focus. Winds look to strengthen around the time of frontal
passage but currently stay below Wind Advisory criteria. Specifics
relating to this system are likely to continue evolving as it
gets closer in time so residents are advised to stay up to date
with the forecast as we head into next week.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 511 AM PDT Thu Oct 30 2025

LIFR CIGS and pockets of fog are building along the coast and some
of the interior valleys, as well as around the bays. CIGs start to
erode in the mid morning with most areas clearing by the afternoon.
The exception being HAF which keeps CIGs through the TAF period.
Expect mostly light winds through the morning that become more
moderate to breezy for the afternoon. Expect winds to reduce for
most areas into the evening as IFR CIGS build along the coast and
move inland into the night. Widespread IFR CIGs affect the region by
early Friday morning.

Vicinity of SFO...Moments of LIFR CIGs linger through the mid
morning before clearing. Expect moderate west winds into the
afternoon before winds increase and reach 21 kt gusts. Winds reduce
slightly into the night as gusts cut off. IFR CIGs arrive at the
terminal into early Friday as winds become light.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...LIFR CIGS affect the terminals into the
late morning, but erode as more moderate winds arrive. Winds reduce
into the evening with IFR CIGs quickly arriving to MRY. CIGs will
slowly move to SNS into the late night.

.MARINE...
(Today through Tuesday)
Issued at 839 AM PDT Thu Oct 30 2025

Expect moderate to fresh breezes with occasional near gale force
winds over the outer waters and nearshore south of Point Sur
through the weekend. Seas build today but subside slightly on
Friday then rebuild again over the weekend with a longer period
swell. Winds reduce into the early work week but build again in
the mid week ahead of frontal passages and rain chances.
