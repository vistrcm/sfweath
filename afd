 - Gradual cooling trend through the remainder of the week.

.UPDATE...
Issued at 918 AM PDT Tue Sep 2 2025

We had a bit of excitement for any early risers this morning thanks
to some thunderstorms that developed along our CWA border. The bulk
of the thunderstorms were to our east over the Central Valley but we
did have a handful of lightning strikes within Contra Costa,
Alameda, Santa Clara, San Benito, and Monterey Counties. The
majority of these storms are producing dry lightning (i.e. any
precipitation that is associated with the thunderstorm evaporates
before reaching the surface) so we have seen a few small fires pop
up in Monterey/San Benito Counties. A 20-30% chance of thunderstorms
continues through 6PM today for the far most eastern portions of
Napa, Contra Costa, Alameda, Santa Clara, San Benito, and Monterey
Counties. The caveat to this is that we are seeing a drier air mass
move in into the middle and upper levels of the atmosphere. This
should help limit our overall thunderstorm potential today, but, we
will continue to monitor as a low, 20-30% chance, of thunderstorms
does continue for the far eastern portions of our CWA.

.SHORT TERM...
Issued at 156 AM PDT Tue Sep 2 2025
(Today and tonight)

Today`s forecast is interesting as we have an upper level low just
off to our west, which will slowly make its way towards our coast
today. While that is occuring, monsoonal moisture surges northward
across the Golden State. What we`ve seen so far, is convection
flaring across the southern San Joaquin Valley and just to our
south, along San Louis Obispo`s interior mountains. Expect this
trend to continue with storms drifting northward this morning and
chances gradually increasing to 15-20% around daybreak. We`ll have
lift from either the upper low or the terrain and decent moisture as
PWATs should be around 0.75 to 1.25 inches today. The limiting
factor should CAPE as models tend to keep amounts light, around a
couple hundred J/kg or less and there should be some CIN. Mid level
lapse rates today favor around 7-8C, total totals around 44-58, and
LI`s around 0 to -3. If we`re able to overcome any drier air and
bust the cap, a few showers and isolated thunderstorms will be
possible through the early afternoon hours. Chances then begin to
decrease mid to late afternoon as the upper low traverses north and
we lose daytime heating.

Outside of the thunderstorms, expect fairly quiet conditions today,
with temperatures starting their gradual cooling trend today. &&

.LONG TERM...
Issued at 156 AM PDT Tue Sep 2 2025
(Wednesday through Monday)

Not much change in the extended as the gradual cooling eventually
steadies by the weekend. Cluster analysis shows upper level troughing
holding over meandering over the E PAC and gradually approaching the
PacNW late in the weekend or early next week. We can expect the
marine layer to deep and as a result, we`ll see stratus developing
each evening and then spreading inland overnight. The CPC continues
to show near normal temperatures and above average precipitation.
Note: Above average precipitation this time of year does not amount
to much and may be in the form of coastal drizzle and/or light rain.
Thus, widespread rainfall is not expected.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 409 AM PDT Tue Sep 2 2025

Mostly clear skies this morning as dry air mixes into the marine
layer, keeping stratus confined to the coastline areas. Current
radar showing a well-formed cluster of showers and thunderstorms
riding along the terrain between the Bay Area and Central Valley.
Some of this activity will be invof East Bay terminals through
sunrise, but remains fairly scattered. As the showers move
northward, skies clear out and looks like a beautiful VFR day
before the marine layer deepens and robust marine stratus returns
this evening across most terminals.

Vicinity of SFO...Anticipating VFR through this morning and
afternoon before marine stratus begins working its way through the
Golden Gate late this afternoon. Ltg visible from the terminal
this morning will stay well to the east and is not anticipated to
affect the terminal.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...Currently IFR/LIFR cigs across the
Monterey Bay coastal area with some periodic scattering out just
inland from the immediate coastline. VFR this afternoon as stratus
pulls back to the coast, the high confidence in another round of
IFR/LIFR cigs overnight tonight.

.MARINE...
(Tonight through next Sunday)
Issued at 849 PM PDT Mon Sep 1 2025

Northwesterly breezes will diminish through the night, with
moderate to fresh breezes prevailing through Friday. Strong gusts
and thus hazardous conditions for small craft will return to the
outer waters and coastal jet regions by Wednesday. Moderate seas
will prevail through Friday with occasional rough seas in the
outer waters.

&&

.FIRE WEATHER...
Issued at 156 AM PDT Tue Sep 2 2025

An upper level low continues to move northeastward passing over
the region today. The low is surrounded by some drier air off
shore, but has started to tap into residual mid level moisture
this morning. The primary concern is there is a low, 15-20%,
chance of high impact weather if any elevated showers, isolated
dry lightning and storm associated gusty outflow winds develop.
The best chances look to be across our interior and most eastern
regions, favoring Contra Costa, Alameda, Santa Clara, San Benito, and
Monterey counties. For interior portions of the North Bay, chances
are less than 10%, but will still be monitored.

Otherwise a cooling trend sets in Tuesday and will continue through
the remainder of the extended forecast. Daily highs and lows will
be closer to normal for early September.

.MTR WATCHES/WARNINGS/ADVISORIES...
