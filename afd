...New AVIATION...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 229 AM PDT Sun Aug 6 2023

Warm temperatures in store for today with moderate HeatRisk
blanketing interior regions of the Bay Area and Central Coast. A
gradual cooling trend will begin for the inland areas on Monday,
with more noticeable cooling for Tuesday as a trough of low
pressure digs off the coast. The immediate coast will continue to
see night and morning low clouds and fog, with temperatures
remaining near to below normal into the upcoming weekend.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 229 AM PDT Sun Aug 6 2023

The upper level ridge building from the Desert Southwest reaches its
peak today, and so will the heat. Lows for this morning will stay in
the mid 50s to lower 60s for the lower elevations, with higher
elevations seeing lows into the 70s. High temperatures in the inland
valleys will rise to the lower to mid 100s, with highs reaching the
upper 70s to mid 80s along the Bayshore and the low to mid 70s
along the Pacific Coast. A robust northerly pressure gradient will
contribute to breezy winds across the region, with many of the
valleys seeing winds up to 15-25 miles per hour.

A Moderate HeatRisk continues for the inland valleys today, meaning
that there is a risk for heat-related illnesses for sensitive
populations, such as children, the elderly, pregnant women, and
outdoor workers. Some tips on avoiding heatstroke:

* Stay hydrated and drink plenty of fluids.
* Wear lightweight, light-colored clothing.
* Reduce time spent outdoors or stay in the shade.
* Never leave people or pets unattended in vehicles.

.LONG TERM...
(Monday through Saturday)
Issued at 229 AM PDT Sun Aug 6 2023

By Monday, apex of upper level ridge will start to shift east back
over AZ/NM/TX. CA will remain on the western periphery of high
pressure so temperatures will still be warm on Monday, but
generally 2-5 degrees cooler across the region compared to today.
Only pockets of Moderate HeatRisk will persist on Monday, existing
over the inland portions of the forecast area bordering the Sac
Valley as well as southern Santa Clara Valley.

Temperatures cool drastically by Tuesday thanks to deepening of
upper trough down the West Coast. Cooler, near to slightly below
normal temperatures will persist through the end of the week.
Marine layer will likely deepen in response, resulting in more
widespread low cloud coverage next week in the mornings.

With this pattern setup (i.e., no high pressure to block/deflect),
it opens the door for remnants of tropical system Eugene to
venture north into Baja/SoCal coastal waters. This will allow for
mid/upper level moisture to funnel in mid-late week; deterministic
and their ensembles continue to show this moisture advecting in to
the Bay Area and Central Coast Thu-Sat, however there is still a
good deal of uncertainty in regards to how much moisture, where
the moisture axis will set up, exact timing, and if any measurable
precip will manifest.. so stay tuned for updates. As of right
now, slight chance (15%) for precip exists to our south over SLO
County and near Point Conception as well as over the coastal
waters Wed- Thu timeframe. Will continue to monitor.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 421 AM PDT Sun Aug 6 2023

IFR-LIFR stratus along the immediate coast south of the Golden Gate,
with inland intrusion across the Monterey bay region and down the
Salinas Valley. Although the northerly pressure gradient is
weakening, combined with a compressed marine layer it is still
inhibiting stratus intrusion into the San Francisco Bay. Clearing of
inland stratus expected throughout the morning. Winds will flow in a
westerly onshore pattern with speeds up to 10-15 knots at the
terminals. IFR-LIFR stratus returns to the Monterey Bay area in the
late evening hours.

The HRRR continues to show smoke from the wildfires in southwestern
Oregon coming southward through Sunday, causing possible issues with
slant visibilities at sunrise and sunset.

Vicinity of SFO...High confidence of no stratus development through
the TAF period, as a strong northerly pressure gradient and a
compressed marine layer suppress stratus intrusion. Light winds
continue overnight, with building west-northwest flow in the
afternoon with gusts up to 25 knots. Winds diminish again during the
evening, with high confidence (80-90% probability) that no stratus
will develop again through Monday morning.

SFO Bridge Approach...Smoke carried south from wildfires in Oregon
could impact slant visibilities at sunrise and sunset. Otherwise,
similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...IFR-LIFR stratus persists through the
night. Moderate confidence (40-50% probability) remains for fog
developing at MRY until around 16Z. SNS clears out around 17Z, with
more uncertainty in clearing times for MRY. Have trended earlier for
clearing to VFR, but model output suggests clearing as early as 17-
18Z. Afternoon winds from the west-northwest at speeds of 10-15
knots. Stratus returning late on Sunday evening, with moderate
confidence (40-60% probability) of ceilings at MRY by the end of the
TAF period.

.MARINE...
(Today through Friday)
Issued at 229 AM PDT Sun Aug 6 2023

Surface high pressure persists over the eastern Pacific, resulting
in ongoing strong and gusty northwesterly to northerly winds
across the coastal waters. Hazardous, steep wind waves will
continue across the coastal waters in response to strong winds.
Gusty winds across the waters will diminish by midweek as surface
high pressure shifts west further offshore. Light, moderate
period southwesterly swell and moderate period southerly swell
will continue into next week.
