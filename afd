.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 253 AM PST Wed Feb 26 2025

Warm and dry conditions through today and perhaps again tomorrow,
with hazardous beach and boating conditions through the period.
Chances for precipitation have come down for Thursday and Friday,
with a more substantial pattern change occuring over the weekend and
into next week. This will bring several chances for rain and active
weather.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 253 AM PST Wed Feb 26 2025

Upper level ridging builds into the region today, leading to mostly
sunny skies and temperatures warming into the low to mid 70s for
many of Bay Area valleys, while central coast valleys have the
opportunity to warm into the mid to upper 70s. Near the coast and at
higher elevations, highs will be warmer too, and generally in the
60s. Ridging will be pushed east late Wednesday into Thursday
morning, as an upper level low forms off the coast of CA. This will
bring increasing cloud cover generally keeping low temperatures in
40s.

.LONG TERM...
(Thursday through Tuesday)
Issued at 253 AM PST Wed Feb 26 2025

Upper low makes its towards the CA coast on Thursday which should
bring us a mix of sun and clouds. With the system moving slightly
slower, opted to remove rain chances for much of the region. The
question will be, do we get enough sun to bring another warm day
with temperatures, potentially mirroring Wednesday`s highs. For now,
opted to keep the trend of warmer temperatures for one more day.

Thursday into Friday, the upper low is expected to pass closer to
southern CA. PoP chances might clip our Central Coast waters and
perhaps form some showers over the mountains of Monterey County. The
NBM has followed the trend with this, so opted to keep that in for
Friday.

For the weekend, rain chances look more reasonable. Shortwave upper
level ridging quickly passes through on Saturday, which should keep
us dry. Rain chances move in late Saturday into Sunday as an upper
level trough moves in from the Pacific. No major changes to the
thoughts on rain potential per the last discussion, but will add
there is a chance we could get a few rumbles of thunder out of it.
For the point and click forecast doesn`t have mention, but should
the trend continue and confidence increases we will need to add that
into the forecast.
