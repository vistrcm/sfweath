...New SYNOPSIS, SHORT TERM, LONG TERM, AVIATION...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 448 AM PDT Thu Aug 31 2023

An upper trough will bring onshore flow and moderating
temperatures today. This should also gradually slowly move
wildfire smoke away from the area. Cooling temperatures this
weekend with small chances for drizzle as low pressure aloft
establishes itself nearby.

&&

.SHORT TERM...
(Today through Friday)
Issued at 448 AM PDT Thu Aug 31 2023

Upper troughing will deepen along the West Coast as an accompanying
cold front passes through later today and tonight. Relatively warm
temperatures for today given the warm start; yet still cooler
compared to yesterday. Raised coastal maxes just a touch to account
for quicker warming before the afternoon sea breeze kicks in. Cloud
cover increases tonight with weak forcing provided along the surface
front. Some deterministic models suggest light precipitation is
possible Friday morning but ensemble support is lacking and
mesoscale models show very little on simulated reflectivity. Think
any precipitation (if realized) would be in the form of drizzle.
Otherwise expect breezy onshore flow later this afternoon and
evening with a strengthening pressure gradient. This should help
alleviate the pesky smoke and haze as cleaner air mixes in. 925 mb
winds increase to around 25 kt this evening over inland portions of
the East Bay, which should provide for locally gusty conditions
there. This will be most prominent at elevation in the East Bay and
Santa Clara hills, including the Altamont Pass. Gusts of 30 to 45
mph are possible, especially for elevations near or above 1,000
feet. This appears to fall short of Wind Advisory criteria, but
we`ll keep a watch just in case things end up a little more
rambunctious. Also note this will be a westerly wind with an onshore
(moist) component. Winds should gradually subside during the late
evening hours. Expect post-frontal conditions on Friday with a
dramatic cool down. Readings will generally be in the 60s and 70s
with the warmest portions of inland Monterey and San Benito Counties
approaching 80. Coastal clouds should be both more widespread and
linger longer into to the day with troughing around and the
established onshore wind regime.

.LONG TERM...
(Friday Night through Wednesday)
Issued at 448 AM PDT Thu Aug 31 2023

The upper trough will evolve to a closed low this weekend. The low
will pinwheel about NorCal before rejoining the westerlies and
departing early next week. Quasi-zonal flow should establish in its
wake by mid week. The nearby low should provide an uptick in clouds
and light precipitation potential this weekend, with the greatest
probability for measurable rainfall well to our north.
Precipitation isn`t totally out of the question locally but is more
likely to be in the form of drizzle if realized. Initially cool
temperatures this weekend will undergo a gradual warm-up by mid
week.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 448 AM PDT Thu Aug 31 2023

Smoke from fires in northern California and Oregon continues causing
reductions in visibilities. The smoke will linger into the evening
before pushing east. CIGs stay along the coast and around the
Monterey bay into the mid to late morning. Winds will stay weak
through the morning but will become breezy and gusty into the
afternoon. These winds look to linger into the night. MVFR CIGS
build along the coast into the evening but become widespread further
into the night.

Vicinity of SFO...VFR lasts through late Thursday night with some
reduced visibility from smoke and haze around the SF Bay until the
late evening. Winds stay weak to moderate through the morning, but
become gusty into the afternoon, with gusts peaking above 30 kts.
Increasing clouds late Thursday ahead of a cold front with MVFR in
the late night.

SFO Bridge Approach...Slant range visibilities lowered due to
wildfire smoke, particularly near sunset. Otherwise similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...Moments of MVFR last into the mid morning
with light winds. VFR with hazy conditions are expected into
Thursday afternoon with breezy westerly winds. MVFR CIGs build into
the evening as winds decrease with IFR CIGs expected into the late
night.

.MARINE...
Issued at 119 PM PDT Wed Aug 30 2023

Strong northwesterly winds continuing over the coastal waters due
to high pressure over the Eastern Pacific and low pressure inland
with gale force gusts continuing over the outermost waters. A
hazardous sea state also persists with fresh, steep wind waves.
Gusty onshore winds develop over the bays each afternoon and
evening, mainly south of the Bay Bridge and over the Monterey Bay.
Northwesterly winds over the coastal waters and afternoon winds
over the bays easing by late week with the arrival of an
unseasonably strong upper level low from the Gulf of Alaska.
