...New UPDATE...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 1209 AM PST Wed Mar 6 2024

Rain chances persist through today with drier conditions by late
week. Unsettled conditions return for early next week with rain
back in the forecast. Overall not looking for anything overly
impactful weather-wise through the next 7 days or so.

&&

.UPDATE...
Issued at 837 AM PST Wed Mar 6 2024

Pretty active start to the day thanks to a storm system spinning
off the coast. The nearby storm has led to showers and
thunderstorms across the Bay Area, Central Coast, and coastal
waters. KOAK sounding indicated a PWAT of 0.82", which is above
the 90th percentile. In other words, juicy airmass in place. As a
result, some of the stronger showers this morning dropped lots of
rain in a short amount of time leading to localized flooding.
Rainfall amounts over the last few hours have varied greatly given
the scattered/convective nature of the precip. A few stand outs
are near Moss Landing, Santa Cruz Mts, and just east of San Jose
with amounts just under an inch of rain. In addition to higher
PWATs the sounding also indicated instability with MUCAPE around
80 J/kg, which is just shy of the 90th percentile for today. FCST
CAPE is expected to be over 300 J/kg. No thunderstorms over land
so far, but a few strikes have been picked up over the offshore
waters. Latest meso-analysis indicates the best instability remain
offshore.

For the rest of today - hit or miss showers/convection will be the
norm. The offshore instability will inch its way over land this
afternoon. SPC does have much of the forecast area in a general
mention of thunderstorms with the best timing this afternoon/peak
heating.

No update needed. Stay weather aware today in case any
significant weather advisories or additional flood advisories are
issued.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 1209 AM PST Wed Mar 6 2024

A closed upper low located around 300 nm west of the Central Coast
this morning will gradually approach the Big Sur region this
afternoon before trekking inland over SoCal tonight. The forecast
remains relatively unchanged with shower chances increasing this
morning and afternoon. Some limited instability is present near the
low and a small (10-15 percent) chance for an isolated thunderstorm
remains, primarily from the Monterey Bay area south. Additional rain
amounts will be overall light and on the order of 0.1-0.2" for most
areas. Exceptions are for the East Bay (very little to no precip)
and Santa Lucias (0.3-0.5"). Given the convective nature of showers
this afternoon can`t rule out a locally higher total here or there
but even this should remain below about an inch or so. Light
southerly winds will switch around to northerly tonight while
becoming a little breezy along the coast. As for temperatures they
will remain fairly seasonal with highs in the lower to mid 60s and
lows in the upper 30s and 40s.

&&

.LONG TERM...
(Thursday through Tuesday)
Issued at 1209 AM PST Wed Mar 6 2024

High pressure will prevail on Thursday and Friday with more sunshine
and seasonal temperatures. Look for highs mostly in the 60s with
lower in the upper 30s and 40s.

A troughing pattern looks to establish by early next week with rain
chances returning. Amounts look light to moderate and not overly
impactful at this point in time.

Forecast model ensembles and the latest Climate Prediction Center
outlook suggests a shift towards drier conditions/near-normal
precipitation headings towards mid month.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 332 AM PST Wed Mar 6 2024

A low pressure system approaching the coast will bring on-and-off
rain showers today along with periodic sub-VFR conditions as
ceilings and visibilities lower during passing showers. Light
mainly southerly winds this morning will shift from the W-WNW
later this afternoon as the low departs to our south.

Vicinity of SFO...Expect broken low-end VFR ceilings this morning
perhaps briefly dipping into MVFR. VCSH initially but minimal
impacts early this morning if brief -SHRA impacts the terminal.
Better shower chances late morning into this afternoon with the
possibility for brief sub-VFR conditions and even brief
SHRA/+SHRA. Low-end thunder potential (less than 10 percent) so
kept this out of the TAF for the moment. Winds will shift from SSE
to WNW in the afternoon low to medium confidence in exactly when
the shift will occur. The best potential range is from around
18-21Z, but showers during this time may still result in shifting
winds. Higher confidence in a prevailing WNW direction by around
22Z or so, which is represented in the current TAF. Shower chances
ending this evening with quiet weather thereafter.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...SHRA and periodic MVFR ceilings have been
impacting the terminals early this morning. Made a few adjustments
to account for this, with VCSH and some SCT lower ceilings. Better
shower chances/greater coverage arrives later this morning into
this afternoon with brief sub-VFR conditions possible in and
around showers. Low-end thunder potential exists (around 10-15
percent) but kept this out of the TAFs for now. Light winds this
morning will shift from the NW-WNW this afternoon. The shift at
KSNS will be abrupt around 22Z due to the blocking effect from the
Salinas Valley.

&&

.MARINE...
(Today through Monday)
Issued at 332 AM PST Wed Mar 6 2024

A Pacific low pressure system will approach the Central Coast
today bringing rain showers and possibly a few thunderstorms
today. As the low approaches the coast and migrates south, winds
will shift from a gentle to moderate southerly breeze early this
morning to a fresh to strong northerly breeze later today into
Thursday. Rough seas will build early Thursday, briefly abate
Friday, and rebuild this weekend.
