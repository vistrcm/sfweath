.KEY MESSAGES...
Updated at 859 AM PST Wed Dec 31 2025

 - High astronomical tides combined with storm surge will bring
   minor to moderate coastal flooding around high tide through
   Sunday.

 - A prolonged rainy period starts today.

 - Strong southerly winds are likely Friday and into Saturday
   morning.

.UPDATE...
Issued at 859 AM PST Wed Dec 31 2025

Light rain is occurring across the coastal ranges, especially across
the Santa Lucia Range and Santa Cruz Mountains with generally less
than 0.05" of rainfall in the past 6 hours. Rain will increase in
coverage throughout the day, yet amount are forecast to generally
remain light. The ongoing forecast remains on track at this time
with no updates anticipated this morning. The San Francisco tidal
gauge reached 1.47 ft above normal (7.31 ft MLLW) at around 7:51 AM
PST and is gradually lowering.

.SHORT TERM...
Issued at 1229 AM PST Wed Dec 31 2025
(Today and tonight)

We switched KMUX to precip mode as rain and/or virga moving in
from the south is coming in range. Most of this activity is over
the coastal waters, and the lowest radar scan can only see 7,000
feet at this range. Unfortunately there aren`t any buoys or ships
capable or willing to report if anything is reaching the surface.
Based on the 00Z sounding, most of these rain drops will
evaporate in the well defined dry layer below 800 mb where the
average relative humidity is less than 15%. Of course the
evaporation itself raises the humidity and makes it easier for
subsequent drops to make it further down. The moistening process
will continue through the morning, priming the lower atmosphere
for more efficient rain as the day progresses.

The overall pattern is driven by a vertically stacked cut-off low
roughly 500 miles west of the Channel Islands. The eastern
periphery of this feature is pumping a large area of southerly
winds and associated moisture from the deep tropics. This low will
catch the next ride NE on an the upstream portion of an approaching
long wave trough moving across the Eastern Pacific. This upper
level pattern will also provide divergence aloft, removing weight
from above the surface low, thus decreasing the surface pressure
and providing some moderate cyclogenesis as the feature moves
towards the Bay Area. We should pick up between 0.5-1.0" of rain
over the next 24 hours as a warm up for the rest of the week. Will
it rain for NYE celebrations? Probably, yes. In the Bay Area a
rain jacket or umbrella should do just fine in the steady light
rain and gentle wind expected up till midnight. If you`re
celebrating on the Central Coast, it may be a little heavier in
the last hour or two of the year.

.LONG TERM...
Issued at 1229 AM PST Wed Dec 31 2025
(Thursday through Tuesday)

The warm, moist southerly winds with an approaching, deepening low
pressure system to our west means we should get a somewhat
uncommon warm frontal passage Thursday. Antecedent warm moist air
with increasing kinematics support as the front approaches should
support some stronger convection and possibly trigger some
thunderstorms as the front passes. This threat will be greatest if
the triple point (where the occlusion, cold front, and warm front
meet) moves over land. The Central Coast has the best chance for
thunderstorms. The thermodynamics don`t look great until midday
on Thursday, but if the timing lines up with frontal passage, it
could get interesting. A NAM point sounding at Salinas shows the
FROPA timing will be very close to the instability window opening
around noon. Otherwise the afternoon of New Years Day should just
bring scattered showers as opposed to the more widespread rain on
NYE.

After the low makes landfall Thursday, a more typical atmospheric
river set-up will takes shape for Friday. A deep trough over the
Eastern Pacific will bring strong SW flow to the California, with
a ribbon of moisture pointed somewhere between the North Bay and
Southern California. The high moisture anomaly near Baja never
really clears out, and will push north again, reinforcing this
round of rain. This should be the wettest and windiest day of the
week, with bigger impacts bleeding into Saturday morning.
Southerly winds will likely gust into the 50 mph range along the
coast and in higher terrain just ahead of the cold frontal
passage. Conditions will improve behind the front, but scattered
showers will continue through the weekend, with 0.5-1.0" expected
each day from Saturday through Monday. A new low pressure system
and associated cold front is possible Monday or Tuesday. The
ensemble clusters have differing opinions on the strength and
timing of this feature, but they all show a trough off the coast,
which is enough to keep rain chances around through the entire
7-day forecast period. KMUX will stay in precip mode for the
foreseeable future.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 454 AM PST Wed Dec 31 2025

Light to moderate winds are expected through the TAF period as a cut-
off low moves into the area. Expect mostly light showers to build
through the day with some pauses in rain chances over the evening,
but shower activity looks to be fairly persistent. Cloud cover will
most stick to the upper levels and mid-levels through the TAF
period, but some sights may see very brief MVFR-level clouds. Shower
activity continues well beyond the TAF period with breezy southerly
winds building into Thursday.

Vicinity of SFO...Light showers are entering the area, but won`t be
impactful until the afternoon, by causing slight reductions in
visibilities. Expect mostly light easterly winds through the morning
before winds become more variable and affected by more localized
effects into the afternoon and through the night. Shower activity
lasts through the end of the TAF period, with winds turning more
southerly and then becoming stronger slightly after the TAF period.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...Light showers are building into the area.
Expect mostly light to moderate winds through the day. Winds at SNS
will stay mostly southeasterly while MRY becomes more variable into
the afternoon. Showers will offer slight reductions in visibilities
through the TAF period. Winds turn southerly at MRY into the night
as southeast winds build at SNS and become breezy.

.MARINE...
(Today through Monday)
Issued at 859 AM PST Wed Dec 31 2025

Moderate to fresh winds and moderate seas continue into Thursday.
Widespread light rain and a low potential for thunderstorms across
the southern waters continues into Thursday. Winds rapidly
strengthen from strong to gale force by early Friday as a second,
stronger, system arrives. Periods of moderate to heavy rain and a
slight potential for thunderstorms are expected Friday into
Saturday. Winds diminish early Sunday but breezy conditions and
rain showers continue into next week.

.BEACHES...
Issued at 859 AM PST Wed Dec 31 2025

Perigean spring tides (King Tides) will impact the region through
Sunday. This is due to the combination of the full moon on 1/3,
lunar perigee on 1/1, and perihelion on 1/3. In other words all
three planetary bodies are lined up and close to each other. In
addition to the high astronomical tide, the incoming low pressure
system will bring strong southerly winds, generating some storm
surge. The combination of these factors will bring minor to
moderate coastal flooding to the low-lying areas near shorelines
and tidal waterways during high tide through Sunday. At the San
Francisco tidal gauge, high tide is expected to be 2.0 ft above
normal at 8:41 AM Thursday, 2.2 ft above normal at 9:34 AM Friday,
2.2 ft above normal at 10:26 AM Saturday, and 1.8 ft above normal
at 11:18 AM Sunday. These predictions include up to 1 foot of
storm surge that will enhance the astronomical tide and flooding
threat. High tide varies up to 90 minutes earlier or later along
the Pacific Coast and through the San Francisco Bay, respectively.
