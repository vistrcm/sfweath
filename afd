.SHORT TERM...
Issued at 125 AM PST Tue Jan 13 2026
(Today and tonight)

Fog has developed tonight in parts of Sonoma County, namely the
Russian River Valley and the northern Santa Rosa Plain. It`s a
little hard to pick out in the satellite imagery, but it is being
shown on local webcams and the observations from Sonoma County
Airport. Visibilities should improve after sunrise this morning.
Otherwise, skies remain clear across the Bay Area and Central Coast
with light winds enhancing the chances for radiational cooling
across the region. A Cold Weather Advisory is in effect across the
interior North Bay and East Bay valleys and the interior Central
Coast including the southern Salinas Valley through 9 AM as the lows
dip into the lower to middle 30s across the area. Elsewhere, low
temperatures reach the upper 30s to middle 40s in the lower
elevations and upper 40s to lower 50s in the higher elevations.

No significant weather concerns today as an upper level ridge
continues to dominate the weather pattern across the western United
States. Light offshore flow is expected to develop with wind gusts
topping out around the 15 to 20 mph range, and even then only during
the morning across favored regions near the Golden Gate and the
Pajaro Valley. High temperatures range from the upper 50s to lower
60s in the San Francisco area and the East Bay, and the middle 60s
to the lower 70s in the inland valleys.

.LONG TERM...
Issued at 125 AM PST Tue Jan 13 2026
(Wednesday through Monday)

For the weekly forecast, it`s wash, rinse, repeat. High pressure
stalls over the western United States, resulting in an extended
period of seasonally warm daytime highs, mild nighttime lows, and
light offshore winds. To give an idea of the regional warmth, high
temperatures through the upcoming weekend are around 5 degrees above
the seasonal average in downtown San Francisco, and around 8 to 15
degrees above the seasonal average across the rest of the Bay Area
and Central Coast.

Towards the early part of next week, just beyond the end of the 7-
day outlook, the upper level ridge begins to erode, allowing
temperatures to cool. Beyond that, the level of uncertainty over the
evolution of the weather pattern shoots upward. The previous
forecaster noted the split between those models that break down the
upper ridge more quickly into onshore flow and those that kept the
ridging in place a little longer. Looking at the latest ensemble
model cluster guidance, this still appears to be the case. By the
21st, the ensemble model clusters are split roughly half-to-half
between those with a more pronounced trough across the West Coast
and those that keep more zonal flow or even a residual ridge in
place. All together, it appears that a period of more active weather
may be in store as we head towards the end of the month.

Southeasterly winds this morning will back to become northeasterly
this afternoon. High confidence on sustained winds remaining below
10 knots through the TAF period.
