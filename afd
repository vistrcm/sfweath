...New AVIATION...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 905 PM PDT Mon Aug 21 2023

The upper low moves inland. A few afternoon isolated showers today,
otherwise dry and more seasonal weather returns today through Friday
with an inland warming trend. Wednesday will be the warmest to hottest
day of the week with daytime highs several degrees above normal,
slightly cooler temperatures arrive on onshore breezes later in the
week.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 408 AM PDT Tue Aug 22 2023

It is thought that we finally get to bid farewell to the 500 mb
low that temporarily re-energized over our forecast area Sunday
and Monday, it is now slowly moving away to the northeast gradually
getting absorbed back into the mid-latitude westerlies. This low
has been quasi-stationary in the vicinity of our forecast area
since earlier this month at our latitude assisting in mainly the
northward flux of heat and moisture remnants from two tropical
cyclones.

Mostly mid level clouds are returning and moving inland per satellite
imagery. A separate near surface weak cyclonic circulation straddles
the northern coastal waters and offshore waters, slowly drifting
southward, but is forecast to return slowly back to near our coastline
today. Drying aloft supports greater mixing today, clearing out the
clouds by late morning and afternoon. Shower activity has diminished,
KMUX was placed back in clear air mode for the current time. Later
today surface based convective potential increases again, however with
the departing 500 mb low in its place will be a 500 mb shortwave ridge
today, bringing air mass stability back to our cwa. There still may
be isolated convection, a few showers may develop inland along the
higher terrain this afternoon. Daytime highs today warming by 3 to
5 degrees Fahrenheit over Monday`s highs.

Later today and tonight a steady return of lower level warming
causes the lower level marine layer temperature inversion to
strengthen. Onshore breezes will help usher stratus and fog inland
tonight. Still a bit muggy with higher humidity around tonight, lows
tonight similar to this morning mainly 50s, 60s.

.LONG TERM...
(Wednesday through Monday)
Issued at 408 AM PDT Tue Aug 22 2023

Well, we`re saying goodbye to one 500 mb low, but welcoming a new
500 mb low not far to our northwest during the midweek. Initially
there will be increasing thermal and height ridging over our cwa
Wednesday, the downward compression and warming coupled to August
incoming solar radiation under a clearer sky will result in Wednesday
as the warmest to hottest day this week. Thereafter, since the low
will progress closer to our coast and surface high pressure will be
building across the eastern Pacific this will bring in fresh sea-
breezes since northwest winds will steadily return especially later
this week and through the weekend.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 428 AM PDT Tue Aug 22 2023

Generally VFR with high clouds, with patches of MVFR-IFR stratus
across the region. The low pressure system that is meandering off
the North Bay coast has resulted in practically unlimited marine
layers in the Fort Ord and Bodega Bay profilers. This could
explain why the widespread MVFR-IFR ceilings that were expected
earlier tonight have not eventuated, and as a result, have removed
them from the TAFs. Terminals should largely clear to blue skies
around 18- 19Z. Breezy onshore flow in a generally westerly
pattern sets up this afternoon as winds increase to 10-15 knots at
the terminals. High confidence for stratus development this
evening in the Sonoma Valley, with moderate confidence in the East
Bay and near APC, lower confidence for the rest of the SF and
Monterey Bays.

Vicinity of SFO... Currently VFR with high clouds, have opted to
remove MVFR ceilings in TAFs. Cloud cover clearing out by around 18-
19Z, with model output even suggesting clearing times as early as
16Z. Westerly winds with gusts up to 15-20 knots develop during the
afternoon and evening hours. A low confidence (10-20% probability)
that IFR stratus develops over the terminal this evening and
overnight.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...MRY has gone IFR and is expected to remain
so trough the morning, while low confidence that SNS goes IFR later
tonight. Stratus clears out during the morning with breezy west
winds developing this afternoon. A moderate confidence (30-40%
probability) that MRY sees an IFR ceiling again this evening,
continuing for the rest of the TAF period.

.MARINE...
Issued at 400 AM PDT Tue Aug 22 2023

Winds turning northwest throughout the day as an upper level low
over the northern outer waters migrates towards the east, with
moderate to fresh breezes across the outer waters. Breezy
northwest winds persist across the waters through the beginning of
next week. Breezy winds will also set up through the San Francisco
Bay and the Delta every afternoon and evening. A mix of
northwesterly and southerly swells persists through the week.
