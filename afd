.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 124 AM PDT Sat Nov 2 2024

Rain shower activity will continue through Saturday morning. Sunday
through Thursday will bring elevated fire weather conditions to the
district.

.UPDATE...
Issued at 904 AM PDT Sat Nov 2 2024

Fairly decent rain amounts across the region this morning. Ranging
from 0.4-1.00" in the North Bay and around a 0.1-0.5" elsewhere.
Highest amounts in the coastal ranges, and lesser amounts in the
rain shadows of the Santa Clara Valley and the interior Central
Coast. We are seeing some ongoing shower activity mid-morning with
a few heavier showers moving through eastern Santa Clara county
and over the Santa Lucia Highlands. This will all certainly be
at least somewhat beneficial for the upcoming offshore wind event
tomorrow. For the rest of today, expect showers to linger across
the far southern zones in the Central Coast late this morning into
early afternoon, and clearing out to mostly clear skies across
most of the region to be a very lovely day.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 124 AM PDT Sat Nov 2 2024

Wetting rainfall from rain showers is expected through the morning
as the cold front moves off to the southeast. The environment
continues to favor locally heavy rainfall as the greatest impact. As
this is one of the first rains of the season, roads will be slick
due to oil and water separation. Allow extra time if driving
Saturday morning and always remember to have your headlights on if
your windshield wipers are in use.

.LONG TERM...
(Sunday through Friday)
Issued at 124 AM PDT Sat Nov 2 2024

Fire weather concerns will immediately increase on the heels of this
cold front as global ensemble clusters are in agreement of high
pressure strengthening over the Eastern Pacific Ocean and an upper-
level trough digging into the Great Basin. This pattern will support
widespread strong and gusty northerly (drying) winds Sunday morning
through Monday morning. As this upper-level trough progresses to the
east Monday afternoon, the pressure gradient will be allowed to
relax and northerly winds will be allowed to diminish through
Tuesday afternoon. Come Tuesday night, it is likely that an inside
slider pattern begins to take shape as a reinforcing trough digs
into the Great Basin and becomes a cutoff low. Uncertainty at this
point lies in the location and strength of the cutoff low. Worst
case scenario: stronger, farther west cutoff low, this would result
in stronger offshore flow. Best case scenario: weaker, farther east
cutoff low, this would result in weaker offshore flow. No matter the
solution, Tuesday night through Thursday morning will be the most
critical time period. In order to even begin the thought of issuing
fire weather products there are criteria that have to be met before
it becomes a wind and relative humidity decision: 10-hour fuel
moisture of less than 6%, annual grasses are cured, and no wetting
rain (greater than 0.10 inch) has fallen in the past 24 hours. There
are no locations within the district that have 10-hour fuel moisture
of less than 6%. While the rainfall of yesterday and what is left of

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 428 AM PDT Sat Nov 2 2024

Showers are tapering off this morning and were removed from the
12Z TAFs. There is still an outside chance for an isolated shower
or two through the morning before the skies clear. The Alert
California Siri camera showed fog developing in the Russian River
Basin this morning, which is typically a sign that it will reach
Santa Rosa. Based on this, I put fog in the TAF, despite the fact
that the guidance had a very low probability. Mist has started to
develop at the terminal, which may thicken into fog now that the
wind has died. With no support from the model guidance, the fog
duration is uncertain, so I went with a standard mid-morning
clearing time.

Vicinity of SFO...Patchy MVFR ceilings are expected through 16Z,
but will be on an improving trend through the morning. Otherwise
VFR conditions are expected with a moderate to fresh WNW breeze
in the afternoon.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...There is still a decent chance for light
showers through the morning at the southern terminals as the cold
front moves through the area. Clearing will take a little longer
here, but VFR conditions are expected by mid to late morning and
there is high confidence that they will persist through the
afternoon and evening with gentle to moderate onshore winds.

.MARINE...
(Today through Thursday)
Issued at 428 AM PDT Sat Nov 2 2024

Showers will taper off through the morning as a cold front moves
inland. A tightening gradient between high pressure behind the
cold front and lower pressure associated with the front will
support strong NW winds with gale-force gusts developing by this
evening. These winds will generate very rough wind waves. Long
period northwest swell arrives Sunday night and Monday, further
building the significant wave heights.

.FIRE WEATHER...
Issued at 115 PM PDT Fri Nov 1 2024

Elevated fire weather conditions expected from Sunday through
midweek as a pair of strong upper lows move into the Great Basin
and Desert SW. Live fuels have generally responded well to the
recent cool weather and rainfall, and will get another dose of
moisture tonight into Saturday morning as another cold front moves
through with widespread rainfall. However, as the low moves
inland, offshore winds are expected to increase quickly Sunday
morning and last through Monday morning as part of the first wave
of this two-part offshore wind event. As it is early in the
season, we do expect live fuels to respond rather quickly to the
drier conditions. In fact, the current forecast advertises the
energy release component of live fuels around the region to
increase dramatically above the 60th percentile going into the
middle of this week. The big question mark that hangs over us
right now in how much rain we see overnight, and if any areas can
hang on to some lingering scattered showers Saturday morning. By
Saturday afternoon, we will see how this has played out and
perhaps have a better idea of what the full fire weather picture
will look like going into Sunday/Monday. By the middle of the
week, we are expecting the second and potentially more impactful
offshore wind event, but some uncertainty remains on the duration
and moisture retention. Will stay focused on the near-term event
for now and increase messaging on the mid-week event as confidence
increases.
