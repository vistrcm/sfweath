  along the Bayshore of San Francisco Bay and San Pablo Bay

- Widespread below normal temperatures through Sunday, slight
  warming trend early next week

.UPDATE...
Issued at 823 AM PDT Thu Jul 24 2025

Drizzle has been reported across portions of the region including
Sonoma County, Marin County, and around the Monterey Peninsula.
However, rainfall amounts have generally been less that 0.04".
Expecting low clouds to clear out by early afternoon before
returning tonight into the coastal valleys. Another round of drizzle
is expected for the coastal waters and orographic enhancement
locations.

.SHORT TERM...
Issued at 201 AM PDT Thu Jul 24 2025
(Today and Friday)

The cutoff low off the California Coast will continue to support
below normal temperatures, a deep marine layer, and a slight (15%)
chance for drizzle over the coastal waters and orographic
enhancement locations through Friday. Satellite shows high clouds
from this feature as well as what I like to call an ill-looking
marine layer - patchy and nonuniform - which will equate to an
earlier mix out time as the marine layer has become so deep that it
can no longer support itself or keep itself intact.

A Coastal Flood Advisory (the last one of this sequence) is in
effect from 9PM Thursday through 2AM Friday. Minor coastal flooding
can be expected during high tide along the Bayshore of San Francisco
Bay and San Pablo Bay. Localized nuisance flooding can be expected
in coastal locations that are directly next to Richardson Bay such
as Sausalito, Tam Valley, Manzanita, the Sausalito-Mill Valley Bike
Path, and the Manzanita Park N Ride. Do not drive around barricades
or through water of unknown depth.

.LONG TERM...
Issued at 201 AM PDT Thu Jul 24 2025
(Saturday through Wednesday)

The cutoff low will weaken and become an open wave by Saturday with
similar sensible weather on tap as the preceding days. SJC will put
its record low maximum temperature in jeopardy on Saturday with the
official forecast of 73 degrees coming close to the previous record
of 72 degrees set in 1955. Global ensemble clusters are in excellent
agreement through Sunday with heights beginning to rise as broad
high pressure across seemingly the rest of the country expands
westward. This will lead to a slight warming trend through Tuesday
as a longwave ridge develops over the Intermountain West. The coast
will not budge as the marine layer will likely be
compressed/shallow, keeping temperatures below normal.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 432 AM PDT Thu Jul 24 2025

The 12Z sounding measured the marine layer around 2,500 feet deep,
allowing extensive stratus coverage across all TAF sites.
Fortunately the layer is deep enough to keep ceilings mostly in
the MVFR category (outside of IFR at STS) where they should remain
through the early morning hours. The typical late morning
clearing timeline is expected across all sites, although complex
wind patterns in the boundary layer with a cyclonic pattern just
offshore the North Bay and a sharp trough along the coast could
generate feeder bands and cause low clouds to linger at some
coastal sites. These are very difficult to forecast with any
precision.

Vicinity of SFO...Extensive stratus covers the entire peninsula
and bay, leading to a high confidence MVFR forecast through the
morning. While surface winds should remain from the typical WNW
direction, the HRRR 0-2 km averaged streamlines actually show SW
flow. This may lead to some drier air coming down the Santa Cruz
Mountains. Clearing is currently expected around 19Z, but the
trend has been gradually improving over my shift. Skies should
stay mostly clear through the afternoon with a moderate onshore
breeze before a similar cloud deck returns tonight.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...Extensive stratus coverage is filling the
entire Salinas Valley indicating the marine layer may be closer to
3,000 feet at the Central Coast. This deep layer will keep MVFR
ceilings in place through the morning. While it`s still possible,
any drizzle should be lighter this morning as the SW flow in the
boundary layer means downslope drying for both MRY and SNS.

&&

.MARINE...
(Today through Tuesday)
Issued at 432 AM PDT Thu Jul 24 2025

Gentle winds will increase to a moderate NW breeze Friday. A
fresh breeze will push through the San Francisco and Monterey Bay
for several hours Friday afternoon, generating occasional
whitecaps. Otherwise slight seas will prevail through the weekend.
A deep marine layer will bring consistent low cloud cover and
periods of drizzle.

.MTR WATCHES/WARNINGS/ADVISORIES...

     for CAZ006-506-508.
