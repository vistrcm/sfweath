...New SYNOPSIS, SHORT TERM, LONG TERM, AVIATION, MARINE...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 351 AM PDT Wed May 17 2023

Daytime highs remain warmer across the interior while coastal
areas will hold near to slightly below normal highs due to the
cooling influence of coastal stratus. Otherwise, dry weather
conditions will prevail through the forecast period with slight
cooling late week and into the upcoming weekend.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 351 AM PDT Wed May 17 2023

We`re back in the stratus again. Nighttime satellite imagery shows a
somewhat similar image to what we saw last night. A solid inland
push of low coastal clouds into Sonoma & Marin counties including
southern Napa county...SF Peninsula...typical East Bay areas
(Richmond, Berkeley, Oakland, Castro Valley, Hayward)...the Santa
Clara Valley...all around the Monterey Bay shoreline and filling
the Salinas Valley. The main difference tonight is that there`s
not as far of an inland push into the East Bay. The Fort Ord
Profiler indicates that the marine layer has leveled off to around
1000 to 1200 ft deep. The synoptic pattern overhead hasn`t
changed much: ridging over CA extending northward into the west
coast of Canada as a large upper low spins over the Eastern
Pacific centered about 980 miles west of the OR/CA border while a
weak low is centered just off the coast of Baja California to our
south. Expect highs across the interior to range from the 70s and
80s with a few spots reaching the low 90s. Areas closer to the
coast and around bay shorelines will be in the upper 50s to low
70s. A return of stratus tonight is likely given the persistent
pattern.

.LONG TERM...
(Thursday through Tuesday)
Issued at 351 AM PDT Wed May 17 2023

The synoptic pattern described in the short term won`t change much
through the rest of the work week. The ridging over our CWA will
gradually weaken which will allow for a subtle cooling trend
across the interior into the weekend, but we are not expecting
any notable temperature swings. Over the weekend, the large low
pressure system that was centered west of the CA/OR border will
gradually lift northward and allow ridging over CA to slightly
strengthen. That will allow for a bit of warming early next week
for the interior. Still no solid chances of any precipitation in
the extended forecast as dry weather conditions persist. Overall
temps inland will oscillate in the 70s and 80s with upper 50s to
low 70s along the coast.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 345 AM PDT Wed May 17 2023

Stratus slower to fill in this morning compared to yesterday
morning, though is expected to impact most terminals with the
exception of KLVK. Marine layer remains relatively compressed below
1000 feet, likely not enough to see widespread dense FG, but fully
expect some patchy FG through sunrise this morning. Clearing to VFR
expected by about the 17-18Z hour for most terminals. Breezy onshore
flow this afternoon. Similar pattern for stratus return expected
this evening.

Vicinity of SFO...LIFR-IFR cigs through sunrise this morning with a
clearing to VFR expected between 17-18Z. Slight chance for some
light DZ around sunrise this morning, but wouldn`t expect it to be
too widespread or heavy given the shallow nature of the marine
layer. Breezy onshore flow 10-15 kts this afternoon through the San
Bruno Gap. Similar stratus return this evening with lower than
normal confidence on when exactly cigs will impact the terminal
given less dense coverage around the bay.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay...LIFR and patchy FG this morning as a compressed
marine layer remains locked in through sunrise. Similar story today
as yesterday, with clearing to VFR not expected until the early
afternoon hours for terminals nearer the coast, and a rather early
return of stratus this evening...particularly along the southern
half of the bay where the Otter Eddy tends to advect stratus in more
easily.

.MARINE...
(Today through Monday)
Issued at 306 AM PDT Wed May 17 2023

A ridge of high pressure aloft remains through the forecast period
with a deep upper low in the eastern Pacific well offshore. Winds
diminish today, but increase again late this afternoon. Gusty
northwest winds persist across the waters into the weekend.
Moderate period mixed seas prevails through the week.
