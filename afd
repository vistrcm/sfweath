...New UPDATE, MARINE...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 1205 AM PST Fri Feb 14 2025

While the vast majority of impacts from the atmospheric river have
past, gusty winds and scattered showers will continue through midday
Friday before a return to rainbows and sunshine. A weak cold front
will bring some light rain mainly to the North Bay on Sunday with
mostly dry and mild weather through the remainder of the week.

&&

.UPDATE...
Issued at 832 AM PST Fri Feb 14 2025

Isolated rain showers persist across much of the region this
morning, mostly across the Central Coast. As the air mass aloft
begins to dry out, rain showers will diminish throughout the day and
become dry by this afternoon or early evening. The Wind Advisory was
canceled earlier this morning as wind speeds have fallen below
criteria. In addition, a Frost Advisory has been issued for the
North Bay Valleys, Southern Salinas Valley and the surrounding
higher elevations of the Central Coast from 1 AM to 9 AM PST
Saturday. Otherwise, no updates anticipated this morning.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 1205 AM PST Fri Feb 14 2025

KEY POINTS
*Scattered showers continue through midday Friday
*Wind Advisory remains in effect through 10 AM Friday
*Cold inland temperatures Saturday morning
*High Surf Warning remains in effect through 3 AM Saturday

The cold front has pushed into southern California, ending the
atmospheric river for the Bay Area. While the stream of tropical
moisture has ended, there are still lingering impacts expected for
the next 12 hours or so. The new cold air mass caused the atmosphere
to become unstable this afternoon. CAPE values are around 50-100
J/kg, on a decreasing trend as the air mass dries and surface
temperatures cool. Combined with post-frontal troughing, this
instability is still enough to support scattered showers overnight.
The rain rates may be high at times, but with short duration and
scattered coverage, the impacts will be limited. There is an outside
chance for thunderstorms, but the reflectivity in the hail growth
zone is only around 20 dBZ with these showers, indicating a lack of
ice particles needed to generate the necessary charge build-up. We
also didn`t have any thunderstorms during the day, and the
chances are only going down. Strong winds will continue through
the night due to the pressure gradient between the parent low
pressure system near the Oregon coast and high pressure in the
subtropical East Pacific. As the clouds clear, winds will also
ease through the day Friday. The conditions are right for
rainbows, so keep an eye out.

.LONG TERM...
(Saturday through Thursday)
Issued at 1205 AM PST Fri Feb 14 2025

The clearing skies and cold air mass will lead to a cold morning
Saturday. Inland temperatures will drop into the mid-30s, where
there is actually a slight chance for patchy freezing fog. While
most of it will dry out Friday, any remaining standing water on
sidewalks or roadways could also freeze. Coastal areas will drop
into the low to mid 40s. Saturday will be dry, but the cloud cover
will begin to increase Saturday night ahead of a weak disturbance on
Sunday morning. This system will bring widespread overcast skies,
and some light rain to the North Bay, however we are not expecting
any significant impacts from this system. By early next week, the
upper level pattern will return to ridging and we will enjoy
pleasant weather for a few days with high temperatures increasing
through the week. There is some uncertainty by next Thursday. Some
guidance brings in a moderately deep trough and some
precipitation, while others keep the pattern flat and dry. At this
point, even the most aggressive solutions only show run-of-the-
mill type rain. In the extended forecast, the remainder of
February is leaning drier and warmer than normal. Perhaps the
groundhog was wrong this year?

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 330 AM PST Fri Feb 14 2025

MVFR-VFR ceilings will continue to improve through the day as
scattered showers become isolated and ceilings gradually rise.
VCSH was used in the TAFs due to the quick duration of the
remaining showers. Despite this, many terminals will receive
another shower or two through the morning hours which will likely
bring brief visibility reductions. The strong westerly breeze
will also improve through the day as the atmosphere settles into
a more dry and stable pattern.

Vicinity of SFO...Isolated to scattered showers will last through
late morning. Other than a passing shower, the ceiling will
gradually lift through the day, and the afternoon should stay VFR.
Broad scale synoptic forcing will be enhanced by diurnal effects
to sustain a strong onshore breeze through the afternoon.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...VFR ceilings will be the main feature
through the morning, besides and any passing showers. By early
afternoon the ceilings will lift higher as the rain tapers off.
Winds will start the day confidently onshore before the synoptic
forcing fades, and things get more swirly in the afternoon.

.MARINE...
(Today through Wednesday)
Issued at 832 AM PST Fri Feb 14 2025

Gusty winds and dangerously rough seas continue. Buoys continue to
show significant wave heights as high as 20 feet due to incoming
very high long period swells. Seas are expected to peak Friday
morning before abating over the next 48 hours. Widespread rough
seas  return Monday into Tuesday as a weaker storm system moves
into the  Pacific Northwest.

&&

.BEACHES...
Issued at 345 PM PST Wed Feb 13 2025

A High Surf Warning is in effect through 3 AM Saturday for all
Pacific Coast beaches. Strong westerly swells are building with
west- facing beaches will see dangerously large breaking waves of
20 to 30 feet and up to 45 feet peak waves. Non-west facing
beaches will see dangerously large breaking waves of 15 to 20 feet
and up to 30 feet peak waves. Everyone should remain out of the
water due to life- threatening surf conditions. Stay off of
jetties, piers, and other waterside infrastructure, keep pets on a
leash and away from the water, and never turn your back on the
ocean!
