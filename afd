.UPDATE...
Issued at 841 AM PST Sun Dec 14 2025

Extensive stratus coverage persists across the lower elevations as
the coastal stratus and Tule Fog outgrowth combine. Expecting a
pattern similar to yesterday where the stratus takes its sweet
time to mix out across the region, but does eventually mix out
across most of the interior valleys during the late morning and
afternoon hours, while the coastal regions and the far interior
East Bay remain socked in through the day. At this time, the
temperature forecast is generally on track, but will continue to
monitor observations through the day in case cooler conditions
persist through the day. Touched up the wind forecast a little bit
to account for updated information, but no major changes to the
forecast at this time.

.SHORT TERM...
Issued at 1202 AM PST Sun Dec 14 2025
(Today and tonight)

We are now on the backside of the 500 mb ridge that dominated the
weather for the last couple weeks. A short wave trough is further
weakening the long wave ridging. This feature brought a strong
southerly surge of stratus on Saturday, but wasn`t enough to mix
out the radiation fog across the valleys. So now we have both
coastal stratus and inland valley fog. Boundary layer averaged winds
have shifted from easterly to southerly over the last 24 hours,
but remain weak at the surface. Dense fog is being reported across
the North Bay valleys and interior East Bay valleys. This fog will
persist through late morning before clearing, and a Dense Fog
Advisory is in effect until 11 AM. Afternoon temperatures will be
cooler than they have been with more cloud coverage and dropping
850 mb temps. Both the long wave ridge and short wave trough will
continue to slide East through the day. There is another good
chance for fog impacts Sunday night as the lower atmosphere
remains poorly mixed.

.LONG TERM...
Issued at 1202 AM PST Sun Dec 14 2025
(Monday through Saturday)

500 mb zonal flow with a tighter pressure gradient will move in by
Tuesday and persist through the week. As this new pattern lines up
with higher moisture it will support a few rounds of light rain.
Without a deep trough there is no real threat of heavy rain this
week. High clouds on Monday will warn of the approaching rain,
with the first round expected Tuesday through Wednesday. The
current forecast has been pretty consistent with around 1/4" in
the North Bay and less than 1/10" everywhere else. While the zonal
flow will persist, drier air will move in Thursday likely
bringing a break in the rain. The next round will move in Friday
and persist through the weekend. Beyond next weekend there is a
lot of uncertainty in the details, but the ensemble cluster
analysis reveals good agreement in the overall pattern evolving to
feature deep troughing just off the coast. This could support an
atmospheric river early next week if the moisture plume lines up
right. The Climate Prediction Center continues to show a moderate
risk for both strong winds and heavy rain from 12/20-12/26.
