.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 111 AM PST Tue Nov 28 2023

A low pressure system offshore will bring rain chances to the
region late tonight into Wednesday. An unsettled pattern will
continue into the weekend with periodic shower chances persisting.
Rain amounts overall will be light with temperatures on the cool
side.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today through Wednesday)
Issued at 111 AM PST Tue Nov 28 2023

Low pressure aloft was evident via moisture channel imagery this
morning around 500 nm west of the Redwood Coast. A consensus of
forecast models suggest this wave will devolve to an open-wave
trough while dropping southeast through the Bay Area and Central
Coast tonight into Wednesday morning. The associated surface low
should remain offshore with the occluded front making its nearest
approach to the CA coast Wednesday morning. Given the offshore
trajectory of the low-level features the greatest forcing for ascent
should remain offshore; however still expect scattered showers to
spread inland from west to east from around midnight on Wednesday
through the morning hours. Shower chances should taper off from
northwest to southeast, with chances generally ending in the Bay
Area during the late morning hours but perhaps lingering for the
Central Coast into the early afternoon. Amounts will be greatest in
the coastal ranges where 0.5-0.75" is possible, but elsewhere look
for amounts of generally 0.25" or less. So this should be a
beneficial rainfall with no real hydrologic concerns expected. Some
modest instability will be present over the Pacific waters as well
so can`t rule out an isolated thunderstorm or two (~15% potential)
there. However odds of seeing any lightning for land areas is much
lower (~5%). High temperatures will undergo a cooling trend given
more cloud cover with afternoon temperatures mostly in the lower to
mid 60s for the lower elevations. Overnight readings will remain a
bit milder with lows mostly in the 40s.

.LONG TERM...
(Wednesday Night through Monday)
Issued at 111 AM PST Tue Nov 28 2023

The region will remain in an unsettled northwest flow pattern aloft
as a series of weak perturbations traverse the mean flow. In general
the best moisture and forcing for ascent will remain across far
NorCal and the Pacific Northwest, however we`ll remain just close
enough to occasionally be brushed with some light showers. Rain
amounts don`t appear overly impressive (generally 0.10" or less)
although it`s possible the Sonoma Coastal Ranges could receive up to
0.25" through early next week. Expect a gradual warming trend in
temperatures through early next week as the greatest rain chances
shift north of our area.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 401 AM PST Tue Nov 28 2023

At this time, conditions are VFR across the region, and expected to
last through much of the TAF period, though midlevel clouds will
begin to develop as a low pressure system begins to approach late
today. Winds are generally light and variable this morning, and only
strengthen slightly into the daytime today, generally staying below
10 knots for most terminals out of the S/SW. Into the evening hours,
winds weaken to become light once more but turn to become more SE
into the late night as  rain chances begin for SF Bay terminals and
north. Into the early morning hours of Wednesday, winds strengthen
slightly to around 8-10 knots out of the SE as the best rain chances
begin.


Vicinity of SFO...Generally VFR through the TAF period, though rain
beginning into the late night tonight may somewhat reduce
visibilities at times. Winds strengthen to around 10 knots into the
late afternoon out of the S/SW, then weaken into the evening. Into
the late night tonight to early morning hours of Wednesday, rain
chances begin and winds increase slightly out of the SE. Towards the
late morning of Wednesday, rain chances look to begin to decrease as
the system pushes out of the region.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...VFR through the TAF period, with mid to
high level clouds present. Current breezy drainage winds at KSNS
turn to become more N into the late afternoon, but only briefly. At
KMRY, winds become more SW and breezy around 10 knots. Both
terminals see winds weaken to become light into the early evening.
SE winds increase into the mid morning hours of Wednesday but
stay 10 knots and below. Rain chances begin to appear just barely
beyond the TAF period at this time.

.MARINE...
Issued at 147 AM PST Tue Nov 28 2023

Southerly winds will steadily increase today as a low pressure
system approaches the the local waters. Fresh to moderate breezes
are anticipated, with briefly strong breezes possible in the
northern offshore waters. Scattered showers will develop late
tonight and persist through the first half of Wednesday. An
isolated thunderstorm or two is also possible. Winds will
gradually diminish and shift to northerly late Wednesday into
Thursday before strong breezes develop by Thursday night. A larger
moderate period northwest swell should arrive by late week.
Weather conditions will remain unsettled into this weekend with
plenty of cloud cover and periodic shower chances.

through early afternoon.
