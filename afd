.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 228 AM PDT Fri Aug 18 2023

An unsettled weather pattern is expected for early next week with
cooler temperatures, more cloud cover, and chances for showers
and isolated thunderstorms. This chance is greatest for inland
portions of the Central Coast as the remnants of Tropical Cyclone
Hilary pass to our east.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today through Saturday)
Issued at 228 AM PDT Fri Aug 18 2023

The upper level pattern will feature anomalously strong high
pressure over the central Great Plains and a persistent low pressure
area offshore from the Central Coast. The low will inch closer to
the coast while the western extent of the upper ridge erodes. This
weakness will create an opening for Tropical Cyclone Hilary with
southerly steering flow drawing it poleward as it straddles the Baja
California peninsula. Our weather locally will be influenced by the
upper low with onshore flow, a deeper marine layer, and seasonally
cool temperatures. This should make it a bit harder to generate
convection but can`t rule out an isolated shower or storm across the
Diablo range each afternoon. However this chance is 10 to 15
percent at best. Otherwise look for the typical overnight and
morning coastal/valley stratus with clouds clearing to the coast
and afternoon sunshine.

.LONG TERM...
(Saturday through Thursday)
Issued at 228 AM PDT Fri Aug 18 2023

Sunday through Tuesday:

The upper low will pinwheel offshore as Hilary accelerates north
along the the Baja California peninsula. Hilary should approach
SoCal at near tropical storm strength on Sunday night into Monday
before the effects of shear, land interaction, and cooling SSTs
cause its decay and post-tropical transition. Regardless of
classification, copious moisture will be drawn into the Desert
Southwest and southern California. The last several model runs have
shown a tight clustering of solutions with the consensus track
bringing the system near/or inland over the northern Baja California
peninsula before reaching far southern California. This trend,
should it persist, is conducive to lesser impacts across the Bay
Area with the deepest moisture and strongest winds displaced to
the southeast. That`s not to say that showers and isolated
thunderstorms are out of the question, only that sparser coverage
(15 percent) is anticipated. Inland portions of the Central Coast
could still be clipped by the better moisture with a slightly
greater possibility (20-30 percent) for showers, isolated
thunderstorms, and locally heavy rainfall. This potential is
greatest from Monday morning through late Monday evening, with
lingering showers possible into at least Tuesday. Despite these
encouraging trends for our area, it`s important to note that
Hilary is still fairly distant and that changes to its
track/timing and associated local impacts remains possible.
Therefore be sure to stay current with the latest information from
the NWS and National Hurricane Center. Outside of the
aforementioned weather concerns temperatures will be considerably
cooler area-wide on Monday into Tuesday with cloud cover and
possible precipitation in the area.

Wednesday and Thursday:

The upper ridge perhaps tries to nudge into the area a little
towards mid week but in general the persistent offshore troughing
pattern should continue.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 443 AM PDT Fri Aug 18 2023

The cold core cut-off 500 mb low is located 150 miles west of Point
Conception bringing lower to mid level cool air advection to the
Central Coast through morning; surface pressure gradient is tilted
south-north, the SMX-SFO pressure gradient is 1.2 mb, the SNS-SJC
pressure gradient is 1.9 mb. With the slow approach of the 500 mb
low toward the Central Coast today, this will keep the southerly
pressure gradient and southerly wind going. Otherwise the SFO-SAC
pressure gradient is 2.9 mb adding an onshore wind component.

In response to the lower and mid level cool air advection, the
marine layer is deepest to the south, the depth varying between
2300 and 2500 feet along the north Central Coast to 1600 feet
Bodega Bay per profiler data. Marine layer stratus and fog is
extensive across the coastal waters, onshore breezes ushering
stratus and fog /MVFR-IFR/ inland through morning.

Stratus and fog /MVFR-IFR/ mixing out during the day, then stratus
and fog returning inland tonight and Saturday morning. Lower level
warm air advection returns tonight and Saturday morning which should
at least hold the marine layer depth steady.

Vicinity of SFO...MVFR except tempo 12z-16z IFR until 1730z this
morning. Onshore winds 5 to 10 knots continuing through morning,
increasing to 15 to 22 knots this afternoon and early evening. IFR
is forecast to return late this evening and early Saturday morning.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...Stratus and fog /IFR/ moving inland on
onshore winds this morning, mixing out to VFR by late morning.
Stratus and fog /MVFR-IFR/ returning this evening, IFR tonight and
Saturday morning and onshore winds.

.MARINE...
(Today through Wednesday)
Issued at 435 AM PDT Fri Aug 18 2023

Split wind directions continuing with north to northwest winds
across the northern outermost waters and southwest winds across
the remainder of the coastal waters today. Breezy afternoon and
evening winds developing across the San Francisco Bay and the
Delta today and this weekend. Moderate period southerly swell
through the weekend alongside shorter period northwesterly swell,
with new southerly swell arriving towards the middle of next week.
Tropical cyclone Hilary will be approaching southern California
late Sunday night and Monday morning. The National Hurricane
Center forecasts Hilary to rapidly weaken Monday while moving
northward across California, however it behooves mariners to pay
close attention to updates even this far north since the surface
circulation center accelerating northward may bring gusty to very
gusty and erratic winds to our coastal waters and bays early next
week.
