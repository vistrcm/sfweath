.SHORT TERM...
Issued at 212 AM PDT Sun Sep 28 2025
(Today and tonight)

Impressively deep marine layer blanketing the Bay Area and Central
Coast. The depth is in the 3,000-3,500 foot plus range, which is
definitely on the upper end of marine layer depth before mixing
out. Given the depth, ample low level moisture, and persistent
onshore/southerly flow drizzle has been added to the forecast for
Sunday AM. Areas most likely to see drizzle will be the coast and
terrain upslope areas like the Santa Cruz Mts, Marin Headlands,
and Berkeley Hills. Already seeing a few bucket tips over the last
six hours in response to the drizzle. So what about marine layer
clearing today? It will be slow going and some coastal areas may
not clear at all. Monterey will be one of those places that will
struggle to see the sun. Given the slow clearing and lower 500mb
heights aloft temperatures today will be below seasonal averages
with highs in the 60s and 70s with a few isolated low 80s far
interior locations.

Other item of note for early today will be wildfire smoke. The
Moon Complex in OR produced smoke and the upper air pattern
filtered it down into the Bay Area. Morning air quality sensors
shows moderate air quality, which is likely due to the wildfire
smoke. Thankfully, latest guidance shows the smoke lifting
northward today due to southerly flow. For more info on air
quality in the Bay Area visit: baaqmd.gov

The much talked about pattern change begins to take shape Sunday
night into Monday. Do expect another marine layer push ahead of
an approaching storm system.

.LONG TERM...
Issued at 317 AM PDT Sun Sep 28 2025
(Monday through Saturday)

Active weather returns for the long term as two system will bring
rain and thunderstorms back to the region. A few weather model
trends noted yesterday persist on tonight`s runs. Slower arrival
of precip, less in the way of precip overall, chances for
thunderstorms have gone down, and the large difference in precip
amounts over the North Bay to interior Central Coast.

System one will bring rain back the region early Monday morning.
Steady/stratiform rain will overspread the region early Monday as
the warm sector arrives. Rainfall will initially be over the
North Bay before slowly spreading S and E through the day. Once
the cold front arrives later in the afternoon there are still some
convective dynamics at play, but they`re looking less. Therefore,
will still have a mention of thunderstorms, but over the northern
waters only. The cold front pushes through Monday night into
Tuesday. Post frontal showers will linger through the day on
Tuesday, mainly north of San Jose. Let`s not forget that this
system still has a decent moisture tap with a plume of moisture
extending back to HI. As such, the North Bay could see a period of
moderate to locally heavy rain, especially if it goes more
convective. On the flip side, interior Central Coast may note see
any precip at all.

System two will quickly follow system one with its fropa during
the day Wednesday. This system will have no real convective threat
with it. However, just like system one it will have some decent
moisture. Some of the moisture will be the remnants of Typhoon
Neoguri. Therefore, a period of moderate to locally heavy rain
will be possible, especially the North Bay. Atmospheric River
guidance continues to advertise a period of solid IVT streaming
over the North Bay, wavering south to SF and then  shifting back
north. That means most of the precip will be north of Monterey Bay
region. Once again, the Central Coast will be on the drier side
of things. All precip chances ultimately come to an end on
Thursday afternoon as ridging begins to build in from the west.

Give the southwesterly flow with both systems rain shadowing will
occur in inland valleys like Santa Clara. On the opposite end
coastal areas that favor upslope flow could see higher precip
amounts like Mt Tam and Santa Cruz Mts.

Storm total rainfall Monday through Thursday continues to trend
down. 0.25-1" for the North Bay, 0.01-0.5" for the Bay Area and a
few hundredths to nothing for the Central Coast.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 455 AM PDT Sun Sep 28 2025

Widespread MVFR stratus across the region this morning. The Fort Ord
profiler places the marine layer around 3000 ft in the Central Coast
and closer to 2000-2500 ft across the Bay Area. Outside of the
immediate coastline, guidance indicates interior sites will clear by
the early afternoon with moderate confidence in timing of clearing.
For HAF and MRY, most models leaned towards MVFR persisting through
the entire TAF period with the exception of the GFS-MOS guidance
which suggests a few hours of clearing are possible this afternoon.
Given the deep marine layer and HREF guidance, leaned towards
coastal sites staying overcast through the entire TAF period. Winds
increase and gradually shift southwest to southerly towards the end
of the TAF period as a cold front and upper level trough approach
California. Rain showers and thunderstorms are possible Monday
(after the end of this TAF period).

Vicinity of SFO...MVFR becoming VFR during the afternoon and evening
hours. Highest confidence in CIGs clearing around 21Z but LAMP
guidance shows a slight chance for MVFR CIGs to continue through
23Z. Pushed back the return time of stratus to 09Z with MVFR CIGs
then persisting through the remainder of the TAF period. Winds
remain out of the SW with gusts to around 20 knots during the
afternoon/evening. Winds ease overnight and become locally variable
at times.

SFO Bridge Approach...Stratus may persist across the SF Bay past
when SFO clears this morning. Guidance indicates the easternmost
portion of the bay (vicinity of OAK) is most likely to see patchy
stratus continuing past when SFO clears. If stratus remains across
the entire bay, it may result in a temporary loss in VAPS for the
SFO Bridge Approach even after SFO clears.

Monterey Bay Terminals...MVFR-IFR CIGs continue through late
morning. Guidance indicates clearing is possible at SNS for a few
hours this afternoon while MRY is anticipated to remain MVFR through
the end of the TAF period. Confidence is low to moderate in this
solution with models in fairly good agreement that MRY will not
clear. Winds initially out of the west to northwest with moderate
winds during the afternoon/evening. Overnight, winds will gradually
shift southerly and ease.

.MARINE...
(Today through Friday)
Issued at 455 AM PDT Sun Sep 28 2025

Gentle to moderate southerly winds continue across the majority of
the coastal waters through late this week. An upper level trough
and  surface cold front will bring rain showers to the coastal
waters  Monday into early Tuesday with embedded thunderstorms
possible  across the northern waters. A second system will bring
additional  rain showers to the waters late Tuesday into
Wednesday. Seas become  moderate rough and build to 10 to 12 feet
mid to late week with  winds expected to strengthen again next
weekend.
