.UPDATE...
Issued at 906 AM PST Sat Jan 10 2026

Temperatures are starting to rise across the Bay Area and Central
Coast again this morning with the Extreme Cold Warning and Cold
Weather Advisory allowed to expire as of 9 AM PST. Morning lows were
largely in the upper 20s to low 30s with the lowest reported
temperature being 23 degrees in southern Monterey County (Argyle
Road - 1109 ft, Interlake Road - 900 ft). Slightly warmer
temperatures were reported in the higher elevations where low
temperatures were in the upper 30s to low 40s. Expect two more
chilly nights before we see more seasonal morning low temperatures
returning early to mid next week.

.SHORT TERM...
Issued at 247 AM PST Sat Jan 10 2026
(Today and tonight)

High pressure building into the Intermountain West and a coastal
trough off the California Coast will dominate our weather through
the forecast period. This pattern is resulting in offshore flow, but
it`s generally light and remaining confined to the higher terrain.
Calm, clear, and cool conditions with long nights is a match made in
radiational cooling heaven. Some high clouds associated with a storm
force low in the Gulf of Alaska are streaming in from the north, but
they look thin enough on satellite imagery that they shouldn`t be
able to impact the minimum temperature forecast. As such, cold
weather products remain in effect until 9AM this morning. To put
this cold into context, we`ll use SJC as an example. Their minimum
temperature is forecast to drop to 35 degrees this morning which
also occurred on December 29th and 30th 2025. Their daily record
lowest temperature is 27 degrees set in 1920, there`s a 0% chance of
this being tied or broken this morning. The 00Z sounding observed an
850 millibar temperature of 7.75 degrees Celsius which is above the
daily mean of 6.9 degrees Celsius. This indicates that we are not
dealing with a cold snap as much as we are dealing with a colder
than normal (5 degrees or so) couple of nights. Temperatures will
warm to near seasonal normals this afternoon. Tomorrow morning`s
temperatures will be slightly warmer with cold weather products
likely able to be reduced in area.

.LONG TERM...
Issued at 247 AM PST Sat Jan 10 2026
(Sunday through Friday)

We begin to warm up by tomorrow as an anomalously high amplitude
longwave ridge and its axis moves in from the Eastern Pacific Ocean.
This will result in a 10 degree warm up between now and Friday,
bringing both maximum and minimum temperatures near 10 degrees above
normal. Unfortunately, pleasant weather will coincide with hazardous
beach conditions from Sunday through Thursday. If you are going to
the beach: remain out of the water, stay off of waterside
infrastructure, and never turn your back on the ocean! If you are
wondering when it`s going to rain next, it`s going to be awhile as
global ensemble clusters show the aforementioned ridge persisting
through the end of the upcoming week. ECMWF and GFS ensembles show
rain returning as early as the 20th with the likelihood increasing
the following week. This dry spell isn`t abnormal or something to be
worried about. It`s more of a welcomed break from the watershed (and
meteorologists alike) after the recent onslaught of impactful rain.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 342 AM PST Sat Jan 10 2026

Dense fog impacted KSTS earlier in the night, but high level
clouds put an end to that. There`s still a chance for fog again
given small dew point depression and light winds and will cover it
with a tempo for KSTS. Otherwise, VFR through the period with all
terminals. Winds are rather light and VRB at time.

Vicinity of SFO...High clouds and light (offshore) to VRB winds.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...VFR.

.MARINE...
(Today through Thursday)
Issued at 906 AM PST Sat Jan 10 2026

Light to gentle breezes prevail over the coastal waters as high
pressure remains over the region. A longer period and larger
northwesterly builds Sunday afternoon producing a rough sea state
through at least Monday afternoon. Seas then subside into Tuesday.

.BEACHES...
Issued at 353 AM PST Sat Jan 10 2026

A Beach Hazard Statement was issued for the coast from Sonoma to
Monterey counties Sunday afternoon through Monday afternoon. A
longer period moderate swell will bring hazardous beach
conditions with increased risk for rip currents, sneaker waves,
and larger shore break. This will result in dangerous conditions
along the shoreline.

Stay off of jetties, piers, rocks, and other waterside
infrastructure. Remain out of the water to avoid hazardous surf
and NEVER turn your back on the ocean. Monitor local weather, surf
and tide forecasts at www.weather.gov/mtr.
