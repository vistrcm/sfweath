...New SHORT TERM, LONG TERM...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 409 AM PST Sat Feb 3 2024

Scattered showers continue. The next strong storm system takes
aim on the region Saturday night into Monday with another round
of heavy rain and gusty winds possible. Keep up with forecast
changes.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 409 AM PST Sat Feb 3 2024

Very similar conditions this morning to what was observed the
precious day: showers, slight storm chances, cloudy. These
conditions continue trough the morning. This afternoon and evening
is where conditions really start to change.

Key Messages as the weather changes into the night:
* Strong weather system brings another round of wind and rain
* Greatest impacts Sat evening through Monday
* Flooding of roads, streams, and poorly draining areas
* Flood Watch remains in effect
* Flash Flood Watch for River Burn Area
* Downed trees possible due to strong, gusty winds
* Greatest wind damage concern along coast and in high elevations
* Wind Advisories and High Wind Warnings in effect today
* Very hazardous sea state



As stated by the evening shift`s discussion "The second half of
Saturday is when the magic happens." Shower activity and south to
southeast winds build in the southern portions of the CWA,
particularly along the Big Sur coast. Winds and showers spread
north and east through Saturday night with dangerously strong winds
expected in the late night and through Sunday. Rain rates begin to
increase into the late night as the main rainband arrives.

.LONG TERM...
(Sunday through Friday)
Issued at 409 AM PST Sat Feb 3 2024

Winds continue to look impressive, especially across higher peaks
Monterey Co and the southern marine zones, as winds across the board
have been increased in the forecast update. Wind Advisories and Wind
Warnings go into effect late Saturday night and last into Sunday
night. The coastal North Bay and the higher elevations of the North
Bay have been upgraded to Wind Warnings. High resolution models
continue to improve confidence that these winds can be very
dangerous. The strongest gusts of the year and the storm season so
far could be observed in the Santa Lucias Sunday morning and into
that afternoon.

These winds remain strong as the moderate to locally excessive
rainfall begins to arrive early Sunday. This will cause reductions
in visibility, localized flooding, and the increasing potential for
falling limbs/trees. The USGS has stated the near surface soil is
saturated meaning shallow landslides are possible. The flood risks
linger behind the main rains and winds as rainwater flows into the
main rivers well after the turbulent weather pushes east.



Only small adjustments were made in the rain forecast during the
overnight forecast package. Here are the updated totals starting
from Saturday afternoon through Monday:


1.5" to 2.5": Santa Clara Valley, Interior East Bay

2.5" to 3.5": San Francisco, Oakland, East Bay Hills, lower
elevations of San Mateo Co, interior North Bay, interior Monterey
Co, San Benito Co

3.5 to 5": Santa Cruz Co, higher elevations of the North Bay, San
Mateo, San Benito, and Santa Clara counties.

5" to 7": The highest peaks of the Santa Cruz Mtns. The Santa Lucias
and Big Sur Coast.

Above 7": The highest peaks of the Big Sur Coast.


Shower activity lingers behind this system, but calmer weather
overall is expected to return Monday.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 408 AM PST Sat Feb 3 2024

A low pressure system located 975 miles west-southwest of San
Francisco is continuing to show development on infrared satellite
imagery early this morning. The low will rapidly deepen as it moves
eastward through an anomalously deep long wave trough located
along the California coast; a strong upper level jet stream (polar
and subtropical jets merged) is also oriented toward California.

Residual showers continuing over the area today, then as the low
deepens and moves across our coastal waters tonight and Sunday
morning it`ll bring increasingly strong and gusty southerly to
southeasterly winds and moderate to heavy rain. Conditions are
ideal for rapid, strong low pressure development in this pattern,
the low tapping deep subtropical moisture while drawing in colder
air from the northwest. Near high confidence strong low level wind
shear developing tonight and Sunday since the low will sweep by
to our west across the coastal waters. VFR-MVFR except possibly
IFR in moderate to heavy rain tonight and Sunday.

Vicinity of SFO...VFR, light southeast wind today. Increasing easterly
to southeasterly wind tonight and Sunday morning. Strong low level
wind shear developing tonight and Sunday morning, rain also developing
lowering visibility to at least MVFR, possibly lower /IFR/ in heavier
rain.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...VFR, southeast winds 5 to 10 knots through
the morning hours. Locally southwesterly wind vicinity KMRY otherwise
southeasterly winds increasing by mid to late this evening. Strong
low level wind shear developing tonight and Sunday morning. Moderate
to heavy rain except light to maybe moderate rain KSNS during the 12z
TAF cycle due to a strong downsloping, drying effect of the southeast
wind.

&&

.MARINE...
(Today through Thursday)
Issued at 337 AM PST Sat Feb 3 2024

A strong system approaches this morning and arrives this
afternoon binging very hazardous marine conditions with storm-
force gusts expected across the waters and gales for the SF Bay.
Heavy rainfall arrives shortly after the stronger winds build. A
large southerly swell will quickly propagate across the waters
Sunday and Monday with the passage of this storm system bringing
elevated seas of 16-21 feet waves.
