.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 151 AM PDT Mon Aug 14 2023

with cooler temperatures expected by the end of the week.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 151 AM PDT Mon Aug 14 2023

Earlier this evening saw an uptick in lightning near the Delta as
cells moved west over the East Bay, but quickly dissipated as
instability downstream diminished. Even after this, a cell or two
popped up over the Berkeley Hills, likely as easterly flow was
forced up the Diablo Range in Contra Costa County. Very brief
moments of heavier rain were reported by folks in the Berkeley
Hills/Richmond area, but accumulations were small (a few
hundredths of an inch). Hi res guidance shows we`re likely done
with any rain chances for the remainder of the overnight, but
could be a little shower or two that moves over the East Bay early
in the morning (around 4-5 AM).

The upper low currently centered over the SoCal offshore waters will
elongate and meander north parallel to the coastline. Another
surge of moisture will move northward today, bringing slight
chance for rain across the Central Coast this afternoon. Flow
aloft south of the Bay Area will shift southeasterly as low moves
north, enhancing upslope forcing, which translates to highest
PoPs over San Benito County for the afternoon (still low at
15-20%). Favorable convergent flow in addition to instability
aloft (MUCAPE around 500-800 J/kg) means a small chance (10%) for
tstorms over San Benito Co this afternoon.

In addition to precip chances, it will also be another warm day
today as strong ridging persists over the Pacific NW. Highs today in
the upper 80s to upper 90s while coastal spots will be in the
70s. Moderate HeatRisk for inland spots continues.

.LONG TERM...
(Tuesday through Sunday)
Issued at 151 AM PDT Mon Aug 14 2023

Peak heating is still expected on Tuesday and Wednesday, but will
only be a few degrees warmer than today with highs across the
interior in the mid 90s to low 100s. Nighttime lows will stay warm
as well, cooling to the upper 50s to mid 60s and warmer in the
hills (low 70s). Moderate HeatRisk persists for most inland spots
through Wednesday. Signs of cooling on the horizon by Thursday
becoming much cooler Friday as upper troughing develops off the
coast. As a result, normal to slightly below normal temps are
expected for the upcoming weekend.

Upper level moisture will continue to wrap around the upper low
through the longterm forecast period, but the brunt of it will
remain over NorCal and the Sierra. We could see some quick surges
of moisture wrap around into the Bay Area as low moves north
Wed/Thurs, bringing small chance for rain during those afternoons
(10-15% chance), with highest chances offshore over the waters.
Will continue to monitor for potential rain chances through the
week, but chances overall remain slim.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 449 AM PDT Mon Aug 14 2023

Conditions vary throughout the region with terminals north of
Monterey Bay holding onto VFR conditions, as Monterey Bay terminals
is socked in with LIFR ceilings and visibility. There were moments
of VFR throughout the night but low confidence that VFR will prevail
until 16-17Z. VFR is expected through out the region until this
evening where the marine layer is expected to return, except models
show a more compressed marine layer compared to the previous days.
Therefore, expect fog and LIFR/IFR ceilings for most coastal
terminals, with the lowest ceilings and visibility expected over
North Bay and Monterey Bay. Inland terminals are expected to remain
VFR throughout the TAF period. Onshore winds are expected to become
breezy in the afternoon with a return of light to moderate winds
tonight.

Vicinity of SFO...VFR currently with high clouds over the terminal.
There is some uncertainty on stratus return this evening as the
recent showers may have caused some disruption for stratus formation
that models may have not captured. Therefore, as of now, expect VFR
to prevail through the TAF period, but will monitor for any updates
to the future TAF packages/amendments. Onshore winds are expected to
to become breezy near the afternoon between 13-15 knots with
moderate wind returning towards the night.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...LIFR conditions with some uncertainty when
conditions may improve but as of now, expect near 16Z. Winds remain
variable and light but is expected to become onshore and moderate in
the afternoon with a return of variable and light winds tonight.
LIFR conditions are expected to return tonight with uncertainty on
exact timing.

.MARINE...
(Today through Saturday)
Issued at 449 AM PDT Mon Aug 14 2023

Northerly winds will increase briefly in the afternoon near the
Delta and SF Bay, resulting in low end small craft advisory wind
gusts tonight through early morning Tuesday. Generally light
winds are expected across the coastal waters for much of the
upcoming work week, with the exception of the SF Bay becoming
breezy each afternoon. Moderate period southerly swell continues
in addition to a shorter period northwesterly swell. A new
northwest swell train arrives Tuesday this upcoming week, which
will build then diminish through the end of the week.

.MTR WATCHES/WARNINGS/ADVISORIES...
CA...None.
PZ...Small Craft Advisory from 3 PM this afternoon to 9 PM PDT this
     evening for PZZ530.
