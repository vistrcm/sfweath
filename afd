.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 316 AM PST Wed Feb 7 2024

Rainfall and wind returns late this morning and lasts through the
evening. Wind and rain not to be as impactful as last week`s
storms. Showers become more scattered late tonight and Thursday,
with shower activity diminishing Friday. Cold overnight lows
expected beginning Thursday as a colder air mass advects inland
beyond the frontal passage. Fair weather with highs in the upper
50s and low 60s over the weekend and into early next week.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 316 AM PST Wed Feb 7 2024

At this time, scattered showers
are continuing to push through the southern portions of the region,
namely over the Santa Lucias. To the northwest and off the coastline
sits a spinning low pressure region, which will bring our next round
of rainfall starting this late morning and lasting generally through
the late evening tonight. However, don`t get too excited, as for
most portions of the forecast zone this system will generally bring
about a half an inch of rain or less. The one exception to this
generalization will be the Santa Cruz mountains and south towards
the Santa Lucias. The Santa Cruz mountains may see up to about an
inch of rain, with the highest elevations of the Santa Lucias seeing
close to two inches of rain. The lower elevations of Monterey and
San Benito counties may three quarters of an inch of rain, to just
shy of an inch. For the most part, this appears to be a system that
will bring light to moderate rainfall. Taking a look at models, rain
rates at any one point do not seem to exceed a quarter of an inch
per hour. The Santa Lucias may briefly see higher rates around a
half an inch per hour, but by and large rain rates appear to stick
close to or beneath the quarter of an inch per hour mark. Taking a
look at PWATs, those remain relatively benign as well. Compared to
KOAK sounding climatology, PWATS sit in the 0.6-0.7" range, right
between the mean of 0.58" and the 75th percentile of 0.67". But rain
is not all, beyond the cold front, this chilly air mass will lower
snow levels to around 2900` at the lowest and will provide the
chance for some limited snowfall along the very highest peaks of the
Santa Lucia mountains.

This all being said, despite the fact that these rains will be
largely light to moderate, soils are just about at saturation after
last week and weekend`s storms. Without much of a drying out period,
any additional rainfall will still pose the potential to bring about
minor nuisance flooding and rises in creeks and streams since soils
will not be able to soak up much moisture. So, remember to avoid
driving through flooded roadways, and clear any gutters or storm
drains. After the windy conditions this past weekend, its quite
possible storm drains and gutters may clogged with leaves or
branches blown off of trees.

Alongside the incoming system, winds will increase out of the
northwest with this next storm, gusting up to 20-25mph at lower
elevations, and closer to 30mph at higher elevations such as up in
the mountains. This will be a far cry from the extraordinarily
strong winds witnessed this past weekend.

Beyond tonight, showers become much more scattered and linger into
Thursday. Gusty winds begin to decrease early Thursday morning and
become light, and low temperatures fall into the low 40s to upper
30s beyond the cold front passage. Specifically for the southern
Salinas valley, North Bay valleys, and San Benito county,
temperatures reach close to the mid to low 30s. As a result, a Frost
advisory has been issued for these specific regions for late
Wednesday night through Thursday morning.

.LONG TERM...
(Friday through Tuesday) Issued at 316 AM PST Wed Feb 7 2024

Friday the trough and associated low pressure nudges out of the
region, prodded along by an incoming ridge. This ridge will bring
with it warmer temperatures and clearer skies into the weekend. A
nice break from the rainy conditions overall. If you can break
away from this Sunday`s game on TV, might be an excellent time to
enjoy some sunshine and pleasant weather. High temperatures going
into the weekend appear to be largely in the upper 50s to low 60s.

As mentioned in the short term, we will be looking at low
temperatures in the upper 30s to low 40s starting Thursday. Friday
and into early next week, low temperatures will be something to keep
an eye on.

Come the early portion of the next work week, and a more zonal flow
pattern establishes. However, models begin to show more ridging
developing towards the middle portion of the week, suggesting some
fair weather and warmer temperatures ahead. Taking a look at the CPC
6-10, and 8-14 day outlooks, there are indications of temperatures
being slightly above normal.

All for now.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 359 AM PST Wed Feb 7 2024

VFR with light to breezy NW winds across the region. The next
frontal system will soon approach the region later this morning,
causing winds to briefly shift W/SW as well as bringing widespread
rain and MVFR conditions. Guidance continues to support that this
system will move through the region fairly quickly, so winds will
only be southwesterly for a few hours before promptly switching
back to northwesterly after the front passes through in the
afternoon. Post-frontal showers will linger through much of the
evening today. NW winds will become gusty in the post- frontal
environment with widespread gusts of 20 to 30 knots expected this
afternoon through the evening. Winds diminish by late evening
tonight, continuing to calm through the overnight hours.

Vicinity of SFO...Breezy NW winds with VFR conditions through the
early morning. Winds will start to shift W/SW generally after
sunrise as the front approaches. Rain chances increase after 17z
which will result in MVFR cigs. NW winds return after FROPA
around 20-21z becoming stronger with gusts up to 33 knots possible
through 04z. Post-frontal showers linger through the evening. NW
winds diminish overnight into Thursday.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...Training showers continue to move over
the Santa Lucias this morning, bringing some VCSH into KMRY.
Intermittent MVFR cigs continue as well, so tempo for low cigs has
been extended through 16z. Winds expected to shift W/SW later this
morning ahead of the next round of widespread showers, which will
move through after 19z. Breezy to gusty NW winds return this
afternoon after 22z and will persist through much of the evening
hours today.

.MARINE...
(Today through Monday)
Issued at 359 AM PST Wed Feb 7 2024

Another weather system will quickly move through the coastal
waters this morning, bringing more widespread rain and brief
westerly to southwesterly winds. After its passage, rain chances
diminish and winds will quickly shift northwesterly, becoming
strong with occasional gale force gusts possible across the outer
waters by the afternoon today. Winds diminish tonight into
Thursday, but elevated seas will persist before diminishing
through the weekend.
