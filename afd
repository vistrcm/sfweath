...New SYNOPSIS, SHORT TERM, LONG TERM, AVIATION, MARINE...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 300 AM PDT Mon May 29 2023

Scattered showers over the ocean on Monday, with the slight
chance for coastal drizzle. Temperatures will remain below normal
with stratus clouds moving inland each night and back to the ocean
during the day. Slight chance for temperatures to have minor
warming creep toward seasonal normal values by next weekend.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 300 AM PDT Mon May 29 2023

On look at satellite imagery and it is easy to spot the center of
weather system around the Bay are just along the coastline, west of
the Golden Gate Bridge. This counter-clockwise rotating cinnamon bun
swirl is moving relative slowly and has brought southwestward
moving convection along its northern periphery to the
Sonoma/Mendocino border, as well as northeast moving showers to
the south along the Big Sur coastline. While there have been
reports of moderate sized drops that have caused people to use
their windshield wipers, it has failed to register much in the way
of accumulations. Over the last 24 hours, only sporadic gauges
have tipped to record 0.01", and most others, like that in the
East Bay were a result of drizzle.

According to the latest ensemble runs, the closed low at 500 mb that
is driving the current weather will continue to move south through
Monday and not begin to hook eastward until it gets south of the
Monterey/San Luis Obispo until Tuesday. This will result in
consistent scattered showers over the ocean on Memorial Day. If the
low takes a course closer to the coastline, it would increase
probabilities of light sprinkles from San Mateo down to Monterey.
However, strongest confidence is for it to drift far enough away
from the coast to confine the scattered shower activity to the
ocean; though the chance for coastal drizzle will remain,
particularly along the Big Sur coast. The HRRR is interestingly
enough showing a small swath of moisture leave the Sierra and
wrap toward the low that brings a weak band of light rain to mid-
to- southern Monterey County on Monday afternoon. There is low
confidence in this materializing, but if it does, it should be
light rain and short duration. Cool air that is wrapping around
the center of the low will keep temperatures below normal.

.LONG TERM...
(Tuesday through Sunday)
Issued at 300 AM PDT Mon May 29 2023

By Tuesday, ensembles are showing the low retain its shape but
weaken into more of short wave at 500 mb heading into Wednesday. A
slight southwest-to-northwest ridge axis will try to develop as the
low moves toward the Four Corners. However, the long wave trough
just west of British Columbia will slowly sink southward along the
Pacific Coastline. While rain chances diminish Tuesday through
Thursday, the weak vertical vorticity associated with the trough
will keep a healthy marine layer present, stratus clouds along the
coast and the risk of morning drizzle at least at the coast, in the
realm of possibility through the week.

Over the course of Thursday through Sunday, the long wave trough is
expected to weaken, allowing upper level riding to behind to
develop over the Eastern Pacific. Cluster analysis is still
uncertain on how the ridge will develop, both in strength and
magnitude. However, highest confidence is that it could result in
some light warming around the Bay Area. While it does not mean
heat, it has the potential to at least gradually crawl toward
temperatures back near seasonal normal values by next weekend. And
if what cluster analysis comes true and the omega block over the
CONUS redevelops late over the weekend, it will be a continued
cool start to the month of June.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 431 AM PDT Mon May 29 2023

Mostly MVFR level cigs, though a few IFR conditions are still
present. Cigs will not only lift, but could see more widespread
clearing after 18Z. Scattered showers are expected over the ocean on
Monday, but with the exception of the marine layer adding some
coastal drizzle to places like KHAF and KMRY, no impacts to
terminals expected. Winds will be onshore and breezy. While sun is
expected to shine in the afternoon, stratus clouds are forecast to
roll back in after 03Z, 07Z for inland terminals, once again Monday
night for a return to MVFR conditions.

Vicinity of SFO...Despite the low off the coast, the depth of the
marine layer is holding steady. Therefore the TAF was updated to
have prevailing MVFR conditions through 17Z. There is a low chance
for occasional IFR conditions, but it is expected to be only short
duration, just below 1,000 feet and there is low confidence in it.
Winds will remain onshore through Monday and breezy. MVFR
conditions return Monday night

SFO Bridge Approach...BKN cloud deck 1400 to 2000 feet cover the
South Bay. Clearing not expected to improve visuals until after
18Z.

Monterey Bay Terminals...TAFs were updated at 09Z to keep MVFR
level cigs through Monday morning. There is a small chance for IFR
level cigs, but confidence is low. Brief VFR before Clouds return
Monday night, likely at MVFR levels, but there is only moderate
confidence in that it will depend on the position of the low over
the ocean.

.MARINE...
(Today through Saturday)
Issued at 233 AM PDT Mon May 29 2023

A 9 to 10 second northwest swell with a 18 to 20 second southerly
swell prevails. Winds are mainly light to breezy, as the stronger
winds are being measured farther out to sea. Wind direction will
remain northwesterly through much of Monday, switching to the
south as the low travels down past Point Conception on Tuesday,
then back to northwest by midweek, as they increase and create
steeper wind waves.
