.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 232 AM PST Mon Dec 4 2023

Dense fog has developed over the North Bay Valleys this morning. As
such, have issued a Dense Fog Advisory through 10 AM for the
northern San Francisco Bay and North Bay zones.

Otherwise, warmer conditions are anticipated this afternoon as a
ridge of high pressure builds in from the southwest. As such, drier
conditions are also expected. Look for temperatures to warm into the
upper 60s across the interior to upper 50s near the immediate coast.

Tonight, temperatures will generally range from the mid 40s to lower
50s in the hills. Dry conditions are also likely to prevail.

.LONG TERM...
(Tuesday through Sunday)
Issued at 232 AM PST Mon Dec 4 2023

Temperatures will warm into the lower 70s on Tuesday, some 5-10
degrees above normal for this time of year.

Tuesday night into Wednesday a frontal boundary will sweep through the
region. Conditions on cool on Wednesday for the North Bay and San
Fransico Bay Area while the Central Coast will hold on the one more
warm day across the interior. Unsettled conditions persist into
Friday. Rainfall amounts from Tuesday night through Friday: 0.25-
0.75" in the North Bay, 0.05-0.25" elsewhere, to barely a trace
interior Monterey/San Benito and Santa Clara Valley.

Gradual clearing occurs by Friday night as a colder airmass filers
into the region. This combined with clearing skies will lead to some
chilly/cold overnight temperatures. Highest confidence (40-60%)for
freezing temperatures will be over the interior North Bay and
interior areas of Monterey/San Benito counties. The need for
frost/freeze products will be monitored.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 325 AM PST Mon Dec 4 2023

VLIFR conditions currently prevail across the North Bay terminals
with dense fog resulting in visbys at a quarter mile or less.
Visbys are expected to improve to LIFR-IFR conditions after 17z
before VFR after 19z. Further south across SF Bay Area terminals,
VFR currently prevails but fog is lurking nearby. High clouds on
satellite unfortunately making it difficult to see the fog deck,
but based on webcams, observations, and hi-res guidance, current
thinking is that the best chance for fog and subsequent visbys
