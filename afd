...New SHORT TERM, LONG TERM, AVIATION, MARINE...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 231 PM PDT Tue Jun 20 2023

Troughing continues with below normal max temperatures expected the
next few days, despite slight warming on Wednesday. Breezy winds as
a result of the troughing expected to decrease after Wednesday
evening and through the remainder of the week, becoming light for
most areas. Cloud cover increases as another upper level low moves
in late Thursday evening, bringing chances of coastal drizzle.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 432 AM PDT Wed Jun 21 2023

Another sunny but breezy day today, though gradients begin to relax
today as the upper low starts to broaden out over the western US. As
such, winds will gradually diminish tonight into Thursday morning.
High temps this afternoon still running below average, lower 60s
coastal to mid-to-upper 70s inland. Cool temperatures continue into
the latter part of the week as we remain in a trough pattern. By
Thursday morning, a trough is expected to deepen over coastal CA,
which will likely bring back the familiar deep marine layer,
featuring coastal drizzle low-to-mid cloud cover penetrating well
inland. High temps Thursday look to be in the upper 50s coastal
to lower 70s inland.

.LONG TERM...
(Thursday through Tuesday)
Issued at 432 AM PDT Wed Jun 21 2023

Little day-to-day change as we head into the weekend with the
persistent trough pattern remaining in place. Once again, temps
remain below normal as the marine layer settles back in. Ensemble
guidance is advertising a weakening of the upper low into the early
part of next week, hinting at a subtle warm up. Ensemble member
cluster analysis also supports this as a higher confidence solution,
though temps are only expected to warm to near normal. Really not
much change in the overall pattern during the forecast period, but
looking forward into the longer term gives some hints at seeing more
seasonable temperatures around the end of the month.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 428 AM PDT Wed Jun 21 2023

Satellite shows mostly clear skies over the terminals with some
stratus building off the coast. Therefore, expect VFR conditions to
prevail over the region through most of today. The marine layer is
expected to build through the evening, which will bring some stratus
over the area tonight allowing for MVFR ceilings. Some models show
IFR conditions near midnight near KOAK but had low confidence to
include. Expect MVFR conditions to linger through the remainder of
the TAF period except for Monterey Bay, where IFR conditions are
expected late tonight. Onshore westerly winds will continue to
diminish this morning but will transition back to moderate to breezy
with gusty winds near SF Bay.

Vicinity of SFO...VFR conditions will prevail through most of today.
W/NW winds will be light to moderate this morning before
transitioning to breezy winds this afternoon, with a moderate chance
of gust up to 25-30 knots. Stratus is expected to build tonight to
MVFR CIGs but low confidence that MVFR will prevail through tomorrow
morning. Therefore, expect clearing near 17Z.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...VFR through the evening with a chance of
MVFR condition this morning near KMRY. Models lacked agreement which
caused low confidence to include MVFR ceilings this morning. Higher
confidence that MVFR/IFR conditions will enter the area this
evening/tonight. W/NW winds are expected to transition from light to
breezy this afternoon with a return of light to moderate winds
tonight.

.MARINE...
(Today through Monday)
Issued at 432 AM PDT Wed Jun 21 2023

Moderate and gusty northwesterly winds continue today and are
expected to diminish tonight, with the occasional gale force
gusts through early this morning in the southern coastal waters
near Point Sur. Northwesterly winds are expected to become breezy
for the remainder of the week as low pressure moves in over the
West Coast. Background southerly swell continues, with moderate
period northerly swell expected through much of the this week.
