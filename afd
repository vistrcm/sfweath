...New AVIATION...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 228 AM PDT Sat Oct 14 2023

Weak cold front is bringing light rain showers across the North
Bay with small accumulations of a few hundredths of an inch
expected. Another chance for light rain across the North Bay
returns Monday. A warming trend looks likely for the second half
of the upcoming work week as high pressure builds in.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 228 AM PDT Sat Oct 14 2023

A weak SSW-NNE oriented cold front is slowly moving inland across
the North Bay. KMUX radar continues to show light echoes moving
parallel to the front. These showers are very light and not much
rain is making it to the surface. Only spots with measurable
precip is along the Sonoma Co coastline where only a few
hundredths of an inch have fallen. Sonoma County Airport (KSTS)
now reporting light rain, so we may see more precip accumulations
through the morning. Light showers should be done by late morning.
This front has also brought cloudy skies, which will persist
through much of the day today per hi- res ensemble guidance. This
unfortunately isn`t the best news for folks trying to observe the
`ring of fire` eclipse.

Not much change expected today in terms of temperatures. Expect
near seasonable temperatures south of the Bay Area today with
temps in the mid 70s to mid 80s further inland and upper 60s to
low 70s near the coast. For the North Bay, slightly cooler than
average temperatures will continue today with highs in the low 70s
thanks to lingering cloud cover into the afternoon today.

.LONG TERM...
(Sunday through Friday)
Issued at 228 AM PDT Sat Oct 14 2023

The marine layer inversion is expected to redevelop early Sunday
with warm air advection moving in at 850 mb and high pressure
building in. Warmer temperatures are expected Sunday as a result.
However, high pressure building in will be disrupted by a weak
upper level disturbance moving across NorCal on Monday. This will
bring another chance for light rain across northern Sonoma County
on Monday and will keep temperatures cooler across the entire
forecast area.

As this disturbance exits and treks across the northern Rockies,
it will make way for high pressure to again build in across much
of the western US. From midweek through the end of the week, high
pressure will continue to build across the area, resulting in
warmer temperatures Wed-Fri. Currently Thurs looks like the
warmest days next week. There is not much spread among GFS and
ECMWF ensemble members for max temperatures Wed-Thurs, which
increases confidence that we will see temps in the upper 80s to
low 90s across the interior. HeatRisk will be elevated to moderate
levels by midweek for the Santa Clara Valley and East Bay
valleys. Cooler temperatures are expected by the upcoming
weekend as the ridge breaks down.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 432 AM PDT Sat Oct 14 2023

Weak cold front is slowly moving inland across the North Bay,
where light showers persist. Mix of VFR and MVFR early this
morning with localized LIFR conditions over the Salinas Valley.
North Bay and SF Bay Area terminals have tempos through the
morning to account for the nonzero chance of cloud decks lowering
below 3000 feet. Generally light onshore winds expected this
afternoon with surface speeds not exceeding 12 knots. There is a
stronger signal from models that low clouds will impact coastal
terminals this evening as marine layer inversion is expected to
reestablish as high pressure builds in. Lesser confidence for SF
Bay Area terminals to see MVFR cigs, so SCT low clouds included
for now for the end of the period.

Vicinity of SFO...TEMPO for BKN cigs at 2500 feet for the morning.
It will be harder for KOAK to have cigs lower to MVFR levels with
drier conditions at lower levels across the East Bay. Light to
breezy onshore winds this afternoon generally between 8 and 12
knots. More widespread low clouds overnight tonight into Sunday.
For now confidence is moderate for MVFR cigs to develop, so SCT
included now for the end of the period.

SFO Bridge Approach...BKN clouds between 3000 and 5000 feet
likely linger over the SMB approach through the morning today.

Monterey Bay Terminals...VFR at KMRY with drainage winds keeping
terminal clear. It`s a different story over the Salinas Valley
where LIFR conditions prevail. Visbys are lowering this morning
between 1 and 2 statute miles. Conditions should improve at KSNS
after 15z to MVFR then VFR after 17z. Light to breezy onshore
winds expected this afternoon. MVFR cigs return this evening,
potentially lowering to IFR overnight into the early morning.

.MARINE...
(Today through Thursday)
Issued at 228 AM PDT Sat Oct 14 2023

Gentle to moderate southerly winds being observed across coastal
buoys as weak front slowly moves through. Gentle northwest
breezes return late today generally south of Point Reyes. Another
weak system will bring more light rain and moderate southerly
winds for early next week, mainly across the northern waters. A
long period northwest swell will arrive early Sunday and will
build into the upcoming work week. A larger, moderate period
westerly swell of 7 to 9 feet arrives late Monday into Tuesday.
