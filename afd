...New UPDATE, MARINE...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 404 AM PDT Tue Jul 9 2024

Heat continues this week with another warm up late week. Temps
expected to peak Thursday for most. Excessive Heat Warning
continues for interior Monterey and San Benito, while Heat
Advisories go into effect Wednesday for inland areas throughout
the rest of the region. Cool down on the way for the weekend.

.UPDATE...
Issued at 907 AM PDT Tue Jul 9 2024

Satellite imagery shows extensive stratus coverage inland across
the North Bay valleys, the northern San Francisco Bay region, and
around Monterey Bay into the northern Salinas Valley. Stratus will
pare back to the coastal regions through the rest of the morning,
with temperatures continuing on pace for a cooler day today than
yesterday. The main focus continues to be the significant warm up
tomorrow into Friday. Some model output is beginning to show
convective chances later this week across the Sierras and the
mountains of the North Coast, but at this time, convective
probabilities across the Bay Area and Central Coast remain very
low.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 404 AM PDT Tue Jul 9 2024

Slight reprieve from the excessive heat today for most areas.
Starting the day with robust marine stratus coverage for coastal
and low-lying areas, coming in a bit faster overnight tonight
compared to last night...a sign of things to come. Most locations
shave off 4-6 degrees from yesterday`s highs as a shortwave
trough embedded in the ridge temporarily deepens the marine layer,
reinforcing the aforementioned marine stratus for the overnight
periods. By later tonight, the shortwave trough lifts inland and
becomes rather diluted while the ridge builds further and 500 mb
heights rise once again.

.LONG TERM...
(Wednesday through Monday)
Issued at 404 AM PDT Tue Jul 9 2024

With the ridge building through midweek, Wednesday starts what we
expect to be the last major peak of this heat wave. Temperatures
look to peak Thursday, with highs on par with what we`ve already
seen over the past several days. Far inland areas 100-110, lower
elevation areas more near the bays ranging from 85-100, coastal
areas mid-60s to lower 80s. Heat Advisories are in effect for
inland areas from Wednesday through Friday, while the Excessive
Heat Warning for interior Monterey and San Benito continues today
through Friday.

A more substantial cool down is expected this weekend as the ridge
finally begins to migrate eastward, and a deep upper low forms in
the Gulf of Alaska. This deeper trough pattern over the EPac
should help to deepen our marine layer further and brings temps
back down to normal territory across the region by Monday.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 456 AM PDT Tue Jul 9 2024

Mix of IFR and LIFR at all stations except LVK. Satellite shows
widespread stratus directly along the coast and extending inland
into the Bay Area. Stratus is expected to dissipate by mid to late
morning with 16-20Z as the most likely time frame. Visibilities are
expected to decrease but confidence is low to moderate as to how far
they will actually decrease. Ensemble guidance is much more
pessimistic with forecast visibilities but, between current obs and
persistence, took a slightly more optimistic approach for the 12Z
TAFs and kept visibilities between 4-6SM. For MRY and SNS,
visibilities have been fluctuating down to 1SM overnight with
temporary reductions in visibility expected to continue through mid
morning. Onshore flow continues through the TAF period with moderate
daytime winds becoming light to moderate overnight.

Vicinity of SFO...CIG heights continue to linger on the MVFR/IFR
border with overnight observations currently showing IFR CIGs.
Moderate confidence that stratus will clear out by late morning with
fairly good ensemble consensus in clearing between 17-18Z. Moderate
northwest winds return during the afternoon with gusts up to 24 kts
currently expected. Weaker winds and overcast conditions return by
the late evening with IFR conditions to persist through mid to late
tomorrow morning.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...LIFR conditions persist through mid to late
morning. Visibilities have been fluctuating between 6SM down to 1SM
overnight with temporary reductions in visibility expected to
continue through the mid morning. Stratus is expected to dissipate
with 16-19Z as the most likely time window. West to northwest winds
continue through the TAF period becoming more moderate during the
afternoon before weakening overnight. Stratus is expected to return
by the late evening hours and persist into tomorrow morning.

&&

.MARINE...
(Today through Sunday)
Issued at 907 AM PDT Tue Jul 9 2024

Moderate west to northwesterly winds continue into Tuesday with
the occasional fresh gust possible over the outer coastal waters.
Winds strengthen heading into Wednesday with fresh to strong gusts
becoming more widespread over the coastal waters. Beginning mid-
week and continuing through the late weekend, significant wave
heights will build to between 10 to 13 ft on average over the
outer coastal waters. Portions of the northern outer coastal
waters will see wave heights peak between 13 to 15 feet during the
late week.
