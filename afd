...New UPDATE...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 426 AM PST Tue Feb 13 2024

High pressure in the Eastern Pacific will bring relatively benign
weather to the Bay Area Tuesday, with high clouds, dry weather and
seasonably cool temperatures. A weak cold front will push through
Wednesday, bringing mostly beneficial light rain to the region.
Rain will taper off Thursday before a pair of stronger systems
brings heavier rain over the weekend.

.UPDATE...
Issued at 854 AM PST Tue Feb 13 2024

Light rain showers were observed earlier this morning, mainly
impacting the Marin and San Mateo County coastlines. This shower
activity has since diminished with mainly dry weather conditions to
prevail throughout the day. Expect afternoon maximum temperatures to
range from the upper 50s to lower 60s (40s in the region`s peaks).
Otherwise, ongoing forecast remains on track for the remainder of
the day.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 426 AM PST Tue Feb 13 2024

While morning temperatures will be cool (mostly low 40s), high
clouds are trapping more heat than the previous nights and a
frost advisory is not needed. High pressure in the eastern Pacific
will prevail through the day, keeping the short term forecast
fairly straight forward with mild temperatures, no precipitation,
and high cloud cover. The only question mark is whether fog will
form later this morning. While high clouds are keeping the
temperature 2-5 degrees warmer than 24 hours ago, the return of
onshore wind has also increased the dew point. As such, the RH is
actually running 5-10% higher than this time yesterday. High
pressure is also keeping the winds light. With the exception of
high cloud cover, the ingredients are all in place for radiation
fog to develop in the favored valleys this morning.

.LONG TERM...
(Wednesday through Monday)
Issued at 426 AM PST Tue Feb 13 2024

The weather pattern will shift on Wednesday as a progressive, but
weak, cold front pushes from N to S across the Bay Area. The
thermodynamics aren`t terribly impressive and this won`t have a
big impact on the temperature. It will provide some lift and allow
the air mass to wring itself out a bit. This will not be a wash-
out, however. The 13/12Z balloon found 0.50" of precipitable
water, which is near normal climatology for this time of year
(0.51"). The atmosphere just isn`t juicy enough for a major
event. At least not yet. Rain will taper off through the morning
Thursday, which will otherwise be a pleasant day.

Late Friday another, somewhat stronger, cold front will approach the
CA coast. This system will bring heavier, showery type precipitation
as well as a brief period of gusty winds as the front passes. As
this front clears out late Saturday, a brief reprieve is expected
before a gale force low pressure system moves in from the Eastern
Pacific. This system is much harder to pin down than the earlier
frontal passages and the rain totals are therefore more uncertain.
The best guess at the moment is that the rain will let up early
Sunday before returning Sunday evening and persisting through Monday
as the low pressure stalls off the coast. This system will also
bring cold upper-level air, which will decrease the atmospheric
stability and could lead to thunderstorms. Beyond Monday, the
guidance is all over the place. Some models show the low pressure
system lingering off the coast for several days while slowly
weakening. Others predict the low pressure system will continue
inland. The bottom line is we don`t have a good handle on the
forecast beyond Sunday. Don`t be surprised if the expected
accumulation and/or timing of rain early next week changes
significantly over the next few days.

While the forecast has several rounds of rain and some wind, it is
not expected to be a repeat of the storms earlier this month. For
example, the maximum expected wind gust on Sunday is around 40
mph. 2 weeks prior, several weather stations in high terrain
recorded gusts above 90 mph. The soils are still saturated and
there may be some impacts, but we don`t anticipate the same
widespread issues.

.AVIATION...
(18Z TAFS)
Issued at 829 AM PST Tue Feb 13 2024

Mixed skies this morning with mostly high clouds associated with
moisture aloft. Patchy low clouds around Bay Area and North Bay
terminals will gradually give way to high clouds or SKC this
afternoon. Sea breeze kicks in this afternoon with NW winds
generally under 10 kts. Frontal system will approach the Bay Area
towards the end of the TAF period Wed morning resulting in
increasing SW winds and increasing low-level moisture, which will
bring widespread MVFR CIGs. SHRA just beyond the TAF period (Wed
late morning-afternoon).

Vicinity of SFO...Light variable winds this morning. Typical sea
breeze expected this afternoon. Better chance for CIGs late
tonight into Wed morning ahead of the next system, which will
bring rain early Wed afternoon. Winds expected to shift
southeasterly early Wed morning.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...VFR through the morning. NW winds
generally under 10 knots expected this afternoon/evening. MVFR
CIGs will return Wed morning ahead of next frontal boundary.

&&

.MARINE...
(Today through Sunday)
Issued at 338 AM PST Tue Feb 13 2024

Moderate period northwest swell continues to diminish and calm
weather continues through tonight. A relatively benign frontal
system will quickly move through the waters on Wednesday, bringing
breezy winds and rain. A series of stronger weather systems are
expected to move through this weekend into early next week, which
will bring stronger winds, more rain, and elevated seas.
