...New AVIATION...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 233 AM PST Sat Dec 2 2023

Cool, unsettled weather for the next few days followed by a
warming trend into early next week. An approaching trough of low
pressure towards the middle of the upcoming week will bring the
return of unsettled weather.

&&

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 233 AM PST Sat Dec 2 2023

Isolated showers are moving across the region this morning mainly
across the North Bay, San Francisco Bay Area and down into the
Santa Cruz Mountains. They may reach the Central Coast late this
morning, but amounts are anticipated to be light. By this
afternoon, the focus for additional precipitation will shift north
across the North Bay.

Another cool afternoon is in store with temperatures struggle to
warm much beyond the mid 60s across the interior, upper 50s
elsewhere and upper 40s to lower 50s in the highest peaks.
Tonight, look for temperatures to cool into the lower 50s in the
hills and around the San Francisco Bay Shoreline to the mid 40s
elsewhere.

.LONG TERM...
(Sunday through Friday)
Issued at 233 AM PST Sat Dec 2 2023

A subtle warming trend will get underway on Sunday and then
become more robust Monday into Tuesday. By Monday the interior is
expected to reach the lower 70s and mid 70s by Tuesday. This warm
up will be short-lived as the next mid/upper level trough
approaches the West Coast.

Cooling will take place on Wednesday across the North Bay while
mild conditions prevail over the Central Coast. This is when/where
precipitation chances increase late Tuesday night into Wednesday.
Cool, unsettled weather will continue into Friday.

Once the precipitation tapers off on Friday the focus then turns
to overnight lows. Longer range guidance suggests another round of
chilly to cold night with frost/freeze conditions possible.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 345 AM PST Sat Dec 2 2023

Light scattered showers continue to move SE across the Bay Area,
now moving into the Central Coast region. Mixed bag of ceiling
conditions being observed currently with the North Bay terminals
under IFR cigs, while the SF Bay Area remains under MVFR cigs and
the Monterey Bay region VFR. Unsettled weather across the Pacific
NW will result in sufficient lift/moisture across the Bay Area
where VCSH will linger through the afternoon today. Across the
North Bay, cigs are expected to lift to MVFR levels by the
afternoon, but IFR cigs will return by the evening. For Bay Area
and Central Coast terminals, MVFR cigs will persist through the
late morning/early afternoon. Conditions improve to VFR during the
late afternoon before MVFR cigs return in the evening. Generally
light to breezy W/SW winds expected today.

Vicinity of SFO...Radar indicates light shower activity across the
Bay Area, which will continue to be intermittent through the
afternoon today. Moderate confidence that intermittent MVFR cigs
will persist through at least 19z at SFO and longer through 21z at
OAK. Conditions expected to improve to VFR briefly through the
afternoon as cigs lift. MVFR cigs return by 05z-06z. Winds are
currently southeasterly and will shift SW by early afternoon
remaining under 10 knots.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...Currently VFR but tempo included for
later in the morning (15z-19z) for MVFR cig potential as
scattered showers move through. SE winds will shift NW by late
morning. Higher confidence that MVFR cigs return by the early
evening.

.MARINE...
(Today through Thursday)
Issued at 233 AM PST Sat Dec 2 2023

Gentle to moderate westerly breezes continue through the weekend
with chance for rain across the northern waters. Northwest swell
will build today into Sunday, resulting in elevated seas of 8 to
10 feet that will be hazardous to small craft across the northern
waters. A series of larger northwest swells with a 16-20 second
period will result in a continuation of elevated and hazardous
seas through much of the upcoming week.

&&

.MTR WATCHES/WARNINGS/ADVISORIES...
CA...None.
PZ...Small Craft Advisory from 9 AM this morning to 9 PM PST Sunday
     for Pt Arena to Pt Reyes 10-60 NM.
