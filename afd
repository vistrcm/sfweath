...New UPDATE, MARINE...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 1230 AM PST Sun Feb 16 2025

Some light rain will fall in the North Bay this morning through
midday. A similar system will move through Wednesday. Otherwise
the weather is pretty quiet this week with mild temperatures,
gentle to moderate wind, and unseasonably warm temperatures by
next weekend.

&&

.UPDATE...
Issued at 823 AM PST Sun Feb 16 2025

Light to occasionally moderate rain continues over the North Bay and
is moving into the San Francisco Peninsula this morning as a frontal
boundary moves through the region. Over the past 6 hours, rainfall
totals reported over the North Bay range from a few hundredths of an
inch up to 0.25" in places such as Venado. This boundary will
continue to shift southward as it weakens, yet cannot rule out light
rainfall making it as far south as Monterey by this afternoon.
However, rainfall amounts will generally be a trace to a few
hundredths of an inch south of the Golden Gate. Otherwise, the
forecast remains on track this morning with no updates anticipated
at this time.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 1230 AM PST Sun Feb 16 2025

A weak cold front is approaching northern California.
The Eureka radar is showing returns as high as 45 dbZ in the pre-
frontal stratiform rain band, suggesting moderate rain rates over
the offshore waters. The Bay Area will only see the tail end of this
system. Any rain in our cwa will be light and mostly confined to
the North Bay. By mid-day the front will be both dissipating and
moving inland, ushering in a drier air mass by Sunday night. The
parent low supporting this system is way up near the 50th
parallel. The local pressure gradient will be loose, allowing
winds to remain gentle. Outside of the North Bay, this system
will mostly just be a cloud maker, with a few raindrops possible.

.LONG TERM...
(Monday through Saturday)
Issued at 1230 AM PST Sun Feb 16 2025

While there are no major impacts expected this week, the
pattern is actually pretty active. Following today`s disturbance, a
low amplitude ridge will build on Mon-Tue, bringing benign weather
and seasonal temperatures. By Wednesday, a moderate strength jet
max and sharp 500 mb trough will support another cold front at the
surface and another round of light rain. Again, any rain will be
focused in the North Bay and we are not expecting any significant
impacts. While the rainfall is similar, there will be more wind
than today`s system. The jet max is moving right over the Bay
Area, and 500 mb winds may approach 100-kts for a brief period.
There is a 25% chance we reach wind advisory criteria on Wednesday
for gusts above 40 mph along the coast and in higher terrain. A
more substantial ridge builds later in the week, allowing the
temperature to gradually climb. By Sunday, we are expecting
afternoon temperatures roughly 10 degrees above normal. Inland
areas are likely to reach the mid 70s for the first time in a
month. Exactly a month actually. San Jose and Salinas last
exceeded 73 on Jan 23. It`s been more like 6 weeks for the inland
North and East Bay. Coastal areas will be in the mid to upper 60s.
Circle next weekend on your calendar, it`s going to be nice!
