.UPDATE...
Issued at 936 AM PDT Mon Jul 28 2025

This morning was a little bit drier across the Bay Area and coastal
Central Coast with only a handful of sites reporting 0.01" of
drizzle this morning. The 12Z OAK sounding looks fairly similar to
yesterday`s 12Z sounding with just a hint of drying in the lower
levels (46% today versus 48% yesterday). Diurnally breezy conditions
continue across the higher terrain and within mountain gaps/passes
this afternoon and evening with gusts to around 25 mph. Locally
higher gusts between 30 to 35 mph are expected across favored windy
areas (Altamont Pass region) this afternoon and evening. Stratus is
a bit less widespread today with clearing expected across all
regions by late this morning/early this afternoon. Otherwise, no
major changes to the forecast.

.SHORT TERM...
Issued at 316 AM PDT Mon Jul 28 2025
(Today and tonight)

Temperatures remain below normal today with marine layer stratus
lingering along coastal areas through late morning, similar to the
previous couple of days. Our weather pattern is stagnant with a
broad dome of high pressure over most of the country east of the
Sierra. Persistence forecast remains appropriate for the return
of marine layer stratus to begin early this evening through sunset
and persist through early Tuesday morning. However, coverage of
the stratus late tonight into early Tuesday may decrease somewhat
as drier air associated with shortwave H50 ridging mixes down
closer to the surface.

&&

.LONG TERM...
Issued at 316 AM PDT Mon Jul 28 2025 (Tuesday
through Sunday)

A stagnant synoptic pattern will keep sensible weather conditions
fairly similar through the work week with only slight warming
setting in for the middle of the week into next weekend. The base
of the upper level ridging to our east will begin to shift west
during the second half of this week, supporting the slightly
warmer temperatures. Fortunately, extended guidance indicates
persistent troughing over the eastern Pacific will push the
bubble of high pressure back toward the Four Corners area toward
the end of the weekend and beginning of next week, with no
HeatRisk issues anticipated through the extended forecast.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 359 AM PDT Mon Jul 28 2025

Currently a mixed bag of IFR-VFR at the terminals. Dry air has done
a number on the marine layer with it looking quite unhealthy in
terms of coverage and uniformity. The marine layer is being measured
at 1,100 feet on the Fort Ord Profiler and is expected to slightly
compress through the TAF period as heights rise. As such, similar
conditions are on tap for tonight as what is occurring now.

Vicinity of SFO...Currently MVFR with westerly flow. High confidence
in VFR by this afternoon. Moderate confidence in a sub-VFR ceiling
(likely low-end MVFR to IFR) returning to the terminal
tonight. Westerly flow will prevail through the TAF period.

SFO Bridge Approach...Low stratus clouds will begin to filter into
the approach by 01Z.

Monterey Bay Terminals...Currently IFR with westerly flow at both
terminals. VFR will likely be achieved by the afternoon with low
stratus sticking close to the coast. High confidence in sub-VFR
ceilings (likely on the cusp of IFR/LIFR) returning to the terminals
tonight. Westerly winds will prevail through the TAF period.

&&

.MARINE...
(Today through Saturday)
Issued at 936 AM PDT Mon Jul 28 2025

Northerly winds persist over the coastal waters and gradually
increase through the day. Moderate to fresh winds will prevail
with locally stronger coastal jets. Moderate to rough seas will
prevail through Friday.
