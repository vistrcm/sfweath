.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 245 AM PST Fri Nov 24 2023

Chilly nights and dry conditions continue into next week. Slight
chance of rain by mid next week with an approaching weak system.

&&

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 245 AM PST Fri Nov 24 2023

Clear skies in a dry post-frontal airmass this morning with N/NE
winds gusting 30-40 mph in the higher elevations of the North Bay.
Expect these winds to gradually subside through the day as the
offshore gradient weakens. Dry through the short term with chilly
nights being the only hazard to speak of. Frost advisory for
interior Monterey and San Benito counties this morning will expire
at 10AM, followed by a Freeze Warning in effect for the same area
beginning at 10PM tonight through 10AM Saturday morning. The North
Bay valleys have also been added to the cold weather hazards with
a Frost Advisory going into effect at 10PM this evening as well.
Overall confidence in temperatures reaching the mid-30s in these
areas is high. The probability of reaching low temps below
freezing Saturday morning is about 60-80% in the southern Salinas
Valley, and about 30-50% in the North Bay Valleys.

.LONG TERM...
(Saturday through Thursday)
Issued at 245 AM PST Fri Nov 24 2023

The rest of the weekend looks pleasant and mild with highs in the
60s and mostly clear skies. Chilly nights will continue through
the middle of the week as colder air remains in place and little
forcing for warm air advection until the next weak system
approaches by mid week. Considerable uncertainty exists, but this
would also be our next chance for light rain across the area.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 318 AM PST Fri Nov 24 2023

VFR continuing due to offshore winds and dry air over the forecast
area. Low level wind shear diminishing through morning.

Vicinity of SFO...VFR. North to northeast winds 10 to 15 knots.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...VFR. East to southeast winds 5 to 10
knots becoming locally onshore 5 to 10 knots during the afternoon.
Winds east to southeast 5 to 10 knots tonight and Saturday morning.

&&

.MARINE...
(Today through Wednesday)
Issued at 314 AM PST Fri Nov 24 2023

Gale force gusts and wind waves across the northern outer waters
will slowly diminish this morning. Surface high pressure will
remain located over the Great Basin through the holiday weekend
resulting in offshore winds. Northwest swells will remain elevated
and hazardous for small craft vessels through the weekend.

&&

.BEACHES...
Issued at 312 AM PST Fri Nov 24 2023

A long period northwest swell of 19 to 21 seconds will propagate
through the coastal waters beginning this evening, resulting in
an increased risk of sneaker waves especially for northwest-facing
beaches. As such, a Beach Hazards Statement is in effect for the
entire coastline from Sonoma County down to Monterey County beginning
at 10 PM this evening and lasting through 8 AM Sunday. Sneaker wave
risk diminishes by Sunday afternoon as swell period decreases,
but the waters may still be turbulent with larger breaking waves,
so caution is still advised. In addition to the increased sneaker
wave risk beginning Friday, high astronomical tides are expected
this weekend, which may bring runup farther along the beach.
Beachgoers and tide poolers should use caution and watch out for
unexpected waves that can sweep you off your feet.
