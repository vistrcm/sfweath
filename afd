...New SYNOPSIS, SHORT TERM, LONG TERM, MARINE...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 249 AM PDT Sat May 24 2025

Mostly quiet pattern with subtle changes ongoing through the
weekend. Warmup on the way through next week with above average
temperatures likely by next weekend.

&&

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 249 AM PDT Sat May 24 2025

Upper level trough exiting the region today as high pressure builds
behind. Evidence of large scale subsidence already in place as the
depth of the marine layer inversion has decreased compared to 24
hours ago. This trend will likely continue, and stratus coverage
will probably end up lasting through the day today along favored NW
flow coastal areas (e.g., Point Reyes, SF Peninsula to Davenport,
Monterey Peninsula region) thanks to good moisture advection and an
onshore gradient. Afternoon winds very similar to yesterday with
gusts to 25 mph possible along the coast and NW-SE valleys.

.LONG TERM...
(Sunday through Friday)
Issued at 249 AM PDT Sat May 24 2025

Very subtle pattern continues through to next week where we really
don`t see too much notable change outside of cloud cover and slight
variations in daily high temps. A deep upper low centered over the
Gulf of Alaska is progged to remain in place through the extended
and provide a few short wavelength troughs that sort of dampen our
upper level ridge a bit. This acts to moderate temperatures through
much of next week with a stout northwest flow regime persisting. By
the end of next week, ridging over the western US builds and, in
laymen`s terms, essentially starts to out match the ability of the
Gulf of Alaska low to dampen the pattern and moderate our temps. The
result will be increasing daytime highs into next weekend, resulting
in moderate HeatRisk beginning to encroach on interior areas. This
change is advertised with high confidence based on ensemble guidance
and cluster analysis. A rather interesting pattern is also being
advertised in the model guidance, though more uncertain. A cut-off
low meandering around SoCal and making its way up the coast by the
beginning of June. If this were to actually play out we could be
looking at a period of offshore winds on the north side of the low.
However, guidance has continued to indicate a decent moisture
profile through the column with this system, so the current forecast
actually doesn`t have too much in the way of critically dry
conditions. The situation regarding the cut off low is advertised
with low confidence and should be watched closely over the coming
week.
