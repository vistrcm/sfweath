.SHORT TERM...
Issued at 321 AM PST Sun Dec 7 2025
(Today and tonight)

Rinse and repeat kind of weather for the short term. Very similar
to what was observed 24 hours ago in the broader scheme of things.
Longwave pattern continues to show broad upper level ridging off
the CA coast nosing its way into CA. A few high clouds are riding
the northern periphery of the ridge. At the surface is where the
impactful weather continues with and stratus covering the North
Bay, East Bay, and portions of the Bay Area. Tule Fog is sneaking
in from the Central Valley into the West Delta, North and East
Bay. Patchy dense fog will be possible through mid morning with
vsby less than one mile at times. The Central Coast on the other
hand remains cloud free.

Stratus didn`t really clear yesterday over the North Bay so that
is the question for today? Will Santa Rosa see some sunshine?
Latest guidance says yes, but very late in the day. As such,
undershot max temps from the NBM for the North and East Bay with
highs struggling to reach 50 degrees. Other locations will see
more sunshine and warming temperatures into the mid 50s and 60s.

Expecting a similar pattern again tonight with some stratus and
intruding Tule Fog.

.LONG TERM...
Issued at 321 AM PST Sun Dec 7 2025
(Monday through Saturday)

No major updates for the extended as we`re locked in with this
ridge of high pressure dominating the overall weather through at
least next Friday. That means, some night and morning clouds like
we`ve been having. Tule Fog will still advect into the Bay Area
from time to time. The ridge is expected to build with higher
heights. The stratus deck will compress with a gradual warming
trend over the region. Still looking at 70 plus degrees across the
Central Coast Tuesday through Friday. The amount of clouds cover
over the North and East Bay will likely impact max temps and
limit warming potential early in the week, but ease as the high
pressure builds.

Rain chances still exist for the middle of the month, but odds
are decreasing. Latest CPC has backed off with near normal or
below normal chances for precip through December 20.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 342 AM PST Sun Dec 7 2025

Tule fog pattern still strongly dominating the region. Based on
persistence, low confidence in actually clearing for North Bay
terminals. These areas have a slight chance of seeing IFR/LIFR all
day again today. High confidence in clearing for Bay Area
terminals (sans KLVK), but stratus and fog will be patchy through
sunrise.

Vicinity of SFO...Patch of stratus and fog moving along the
peninsula likely to persist through sunrise, clearing to VFR in the
few hours following. Otherwise quiet and clear through the afternoon
with stratus returning this evening.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...High confidence in VFR through the TAF
period. Light drainage offshore winds overnight with light onshore
flow during the afternoons.

&&

.MARINE...
(Today through Friday)
Issued at 321 AM PST Sun Dec 7 2025

Winds are reducing across the waters, but breezy northwest winds
linger into the middle of next work week with the strongest winds
focused on the southern waters. Moderate seas with wave heights 6
to 8 feet across the outer waters this weekend. A new, long
period northwesterly swell is anticipated by Wednesday of next
week.
