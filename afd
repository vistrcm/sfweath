.LONG TERM...
(Saturday through Thursday)
Issued at 214 AM PST Fri Mar 8 2024

From Saturday into the early part of next week, a series off
troughs rotating around a broad upper low in the Gulf of Alaska
bring light rain chances to the area. Starting on Saturday, the
first round pushes through during the morning, which will mostly
be focused on the North Bay. The second trough moves through
Sunday bringing more widespread rainfall to the Bay Area and
Central Coast. Finally, by Tuesday, a strong ridge begins to build
over the EPac as the last bit of troughing moves into the Great
Basin bringing another chance for widespread light rain. Overall,
the rain associated with these perturbations is expected to be on
the lighter side, ranging from 0.5" across Monterey/San Bentio
and inland rainshadows, up to 2" in the North Bay coastal ranges.

Beyond Tuesday, the anomalously strong ridge migrates over the
West Coast promoting a drying and warming trend through the rest
of the week with highs in the 70s.
