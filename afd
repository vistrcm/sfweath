...New AVIATION, BEACHES...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 235 AM PST Sat Jan 6 2024

A quick moving system will bring rain showers to the region today.
Morning lows becoming colder through the remainder of the weekend,
with the coldest temperatures on Sunday and Monday morning.
Unsettled conditions return by midweek and will continue at times
through the upcoming week.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 235 AM PST Sat Jan 6 2024

Rain is forecast to move through the region by late morning in the
North Bay, through the Bay Area early afternoon, and into the
Central Coast by the late afternoon/evening. Rain totals will mostly
be beneficial with 0.10-0.33" (locally up to 0.50") in the coastal
ranges with 0.15" or less elsewhere. Gusty winds are also
anticipated in wake of the frontal passage, yet likely to not reach
Wind Advisory criteria.

Temperatures turn colder Saturday night/Sunday morning, especially
across the interior. Thus, all interior areas of the Bay Area and
Central Coast has Frost Advisories in effect as temperatures drop
into the low to mid 30s in the inland lower elevations, the upper
30s to lower 40s across the coast/bayshore, and perhaps down into
the upper 20s for the inland higher elevations.

&&

.LONG TERM...
(Sunday through Friday)
Issued at 235 AM PST Sat Jan 6 2024

Minimum temperatures Monday morning are forecast to be a few degrees
colder than Sunday, with the coldest spots dropping down into the mid
20s (mainly in interior parts of the Central Coast). Thus,
anticipated frost/freeze products to be issued by this afternoon.
Low temperatures begin to rebound on Tuesday morning with lows
generally in the mid/upper 30s in the interior (coldest spots down
into the the lower 30s) and 40s along the coast/bayshore.

A couple of weak systems will come through the region through the
early and middle part of next week, one later on Monday and into
Tuesday focused more on the North Bay and another on Wednesday that
should be more widespread. As with Saturday`s system, rain totals
don`t look to be too impressive with these systems, with a combined
rain total of up to 0.2" in the lower elevations, perhaps up to 0.5"
in the coastal ranges. The next substantive system looks to come
through Friday and Saturday. Details on the impacts of this system
are expected to be refined through the upcoming week. Updated CPC
guidance shows that it`s more likely than not that total
precipitation in the area will remain above the seasonal average
through the month of January.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 402 AM PST Sat Jan 6 2024

VFR across the region with the exception of localized dense fog
(LIFR) conditions at KSTS. A frontal boundary is approaching from
the Pacific NW this morning, which will move through the Bay Area
during the late morning/early afternoon hours then down through
the Central Coast terminals by late afternoon. This FROPA will be
relatively quick moving, bringing rain, MVFR cigs/visbys, and
gusty winds. Pre-frontal winds will be southwesterly generally 10
to 20 knots, shifting northwesterly in the post-frontal
environment with increasing gusts of 25 to up to 35 knots.
Conditions expected to improve to VFR quickly after FROPA with
gusty winds persisting through the late evening today. High
confidence that breezy NW winds and VFR will persist overnight
tonight.

Vicinity of SFO...Light winds will soon turn SW through the
morning, increasing to 10-15 knots by mid-morning. High clouds
will build as frontal boundary approaches. Not thinking that any
MVFR cigs will develop before the main rain band arrives (between
21z and 23z) due to drier conditions currently near the terminal.
Winds will shift NW after the front passes by 23z-00z this
afternoon and are expected to increase to sustained speeds of
20-25 knots with gusts up to 34 knots. Gusty winds persist through
the evening, diminishing after 05z but still expected to be
breezy overnight. VFR conditions overnight into early morning
Sunday.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...VFR with light SE winds. Frontal boundary
will approach this afternoon, resulting in stronger SW/W winds
with gusts up to 25 knots. Rain and MVFR conditions will arrive
between 23z-02z today. Winds shift NW after frontal boundary
passes through, remaining gusty through late tonight.

.MARINE...
(Today through Thursday)
Issued at 235 AM PST Sat Jan 6 2024

Long period northwest swell is building early this morning with
significant wave heights of 15 to 20 feet at 17 to 18 seconds.
Seas will stay elevated as stronger winds develop later this
morning and persist through Sunday as a cold frontal boundary
moves through the coastal waters. Widespread gale force gusts are
most likely south of Point Pinos, but occasional gale force gusts
possible with frontal passage further north today. Light rain
expected today as well. Unsettled weather returns early next week.

&&

.BEACHES...
Issued at 402 AM PST Sat Jan 6 2024

Energetic northwest swell of 11-13 feet at 16-18 seconds will result
in breaking waves of 15 to 20 feet (up to 22 feet for steeper
beaches) through the evening today. As a result, a High Surf
Advisory is now in effect for the entire coastline from Sonoma
County down to Monterey County through 7 PM today. West and
northwest facing beaches are most at risk for turbulent shore break,
increased beach runup, sneaker waves, and strong currents. High
tide will peak at 6:43 AM PST this morning, meaning large breaking
waves will run up further along the beach, so be sure to use
caution if walking near the water early this morning. Large waves
can sweep across the beach without warning, pulling people into
the sea from rocks, jetties, and beaches. Never turn your back to
the ocean!
