...New AVIATION, MARINE...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 145 AM PDT Wed Jul 31 2024

Warming trend continues, expected to peak into the weekend where
heat levels off and lingers into next week. Monsoonal moisture
aloft expected by Friday into Saturday with a low chance for dry
lightning.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 145 AM PDT Wed Jul 31 2024

The marine layer is still deep at around 1,000 feet, but shallower
than 24 hours ago. Particularly noticeable at locations above
1,000 feet where current overnight temperatures are running about
5-10 degrees warmer than 24 hours ago. Areas below the marine
layer will hold on to some of the cloud cover this morning, which
will help moderate temps for the rest of the day (high temps
similar to yesterday). Areas above can expect high temps today
about 5-8 degrees warmer than yesterday. The stable marine layer
will continue to compress into tonight as high pressure builds.

.LONG TERM...
(Thursday through Tuesday)
Issued at 145 AM PDT Wed Jul 31 2024

Heat continues through the rest of the forecast period with temps
about 5-10 degrees above seasonal normals depending on where you
are. Coastal areas will hold on the the marine layer through the
event, so temps here will stay at or slightly below normal.
HeatRisk elevates into the moderate category for inland areas
through the weekend and into next week, particularly the inland
East Bay and the interior Central Coast. This will be the type of
heat that poses a risk for individuals who are sensitive to heat.
For now, we do not foresee the issuance of any heat-related
highlights, but a few zones in the interior East Bay and Central
Coast are on the cusp for becoming candidates for a Heat Advisory
by Saturday. Again, holding off for now.

The other weather story this weekend will be an area of monsoonal
moisture that will makes its way into our region along the
periphery of the high pressure ridge. Ensemble guidance is
handling the situation well, with nearly all members advertising
PWAT at or just above the 90th percentile (1.04") for this time
of year based on OAK sounding climatology. The impacts for us
around the Bay Area and Central Coast seem too be fairly limited
by the fact that mid-level instability is lacking. More impacts
are expected the further east you go...into the Central Valley
and the Sierra. We`re holding at a 5% chance for dry lightning
Friday-Saturday at this time, but keeping a very close eye on it
given the potential impacts.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 428 AM PDT Wed Jul 31 2024

Widespread IFR-LIFR ceilings across the valleys this morning.
Stratus mixes out rather late this morning with breezy onshore flow
developing in the afternoon and evening before stratus begins to
return as the winds diminish this evening and overnight, with the
possible exception of the interior East Bay where some model output
keeps the region VFR.

Vicinity of SFO... IFR stratus continues through the late morning.
Westerly winds gusting to 25 knots develop in the afternoon and
evening before IFR stratus returns in the late evening hours,
continuing through Thursday morning.

SFO Bridge Approach... Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals... LIFR stratus and patchy fog possible
through the late morning hours. Breezy onshore winds in the
afternoon with stratus returning early evening at MRY and later in
the evening at SNS.

.MARINE...
(Today through Monday)
Issued at 428 AM PDT Wed Jul 31 2024

Gentle to moderate northwest breezes with fresh gusts and
significant wave heights in the 5-7 feet range prevail through
the forecast period. While not forecast to be of impact to our
area, there are three tropical disturbances in the Eastern Pacific
with a high chance of development over the next seven days. We
will continue to monitor their progression as details become
clear in the coming days.
