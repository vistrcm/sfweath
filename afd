...New AVIATION...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 247 AM PST Tue Jan 23 2024

Our next rain maker arrives late Tuesday night and will continue
into Wednesday. Drying conditions return Thursday and continue
throughout the upcoming weekend.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 247 AM PST Tue Jan 23 2024

Light rain showers showing up on radar this morning, yet should be
confined to coastal areas of the San Francisco Peninsula and the
Central Coast.

Minor coastal flooding is likely during high tide at 9:11 AM PST
Tuesday morning for low-lying, flood-prone spots adjacent to the San
Francisco Bay. Generally dry conditions return to the region Tuesday
with rain entering the picture Tuesday night. Maximum temperatures
will warm into the upper 50s to lower 60s Tuesday afternoon (cooler
in the regions peaks). Tonight we will see temperatures drop into
the mid/upper 40s to near 50 degrees around the bay shoreline.

.LONG TERM...
(Wednesday through Monday)
Issued at 247 AM PST Tue Jan 23 2024

Rainfall from the next system will be less than previous days and
range from 0.25-0.75" in the coastal ranges, 0.25-0.33" in the North
Bay Valleys and the City, with less than 0.25" elsewhere. As such,
no significant flooding impacts expected. Drying conditions are
expected by early Thursday morning.

A ridge of high pressure will build across the region in wake of
Wednesday`s system. While some light rain will remain possible late
week over the North Bay, drier conditions are anticipated elsewhere.
By Sunday and Monday, highs will be in the mid/upper 60s along the
coast, with some valleys in Santa Clara, Monterey and San Benito
expected to reach the low 70s.

In the 6-10 and 8-14 Day Outlook our area is highlighted by a 60-70%
chance of above average precipitation. This is as global ensembles
point to a major rain event by the middle of next week. While is too
early to talk specifics and rainfall amounts, this is certainly
something to keep an eye on.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 317 AM PST Tue Jan 23 2024

Patches of LIFR stratus in the North Bay valleys, and IFR-MVFR
everywhere else, expected to persist through the morning hours
with partial clearing to MVFR-VFR with scattered to broken mid-
level clouds. Confidence has decreased for further spread of fog
in the North Bay and interior East Bays, so have removed fog from
the APC and LVK TAFs. A lightly breezy westerly wind develops this
afternoon, diminishing in the evening. Winds turn southerly
overnight as a cold front approaches, with the rain band expected
to come through the region at or after the end of the 24-hour TAF
period.

Vicinity of SFO... IFR-MVFR stratus continues through the morning
with mid-level clouds persisting through the afternoon. Breezy west
to northwest winds develop in the afternoon and continue through the
evening, turning southerly ahead of a frontal rain band coming
through early Wednesday morning.

SFO Bridge Approach... Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals... IFR-MVFR stratus through the morning with
low to moderate confidence (around 40-50% probability) that MVFR
stratus continues through the day at SNS. Light winds through the
TAF period, currently onshore but turning offshore in the
evening. Frontal rain band expected Wednesday morning after the
TAF period.

.MARINE...
(Today through Sunday)
Issued at 247 AM PST Tue Jan 23 2024

Light rain returns briefly on Wednesday before drier conditions
prevail throughout the end of the week. Midweek, winds will
temporarily shift southerly and strengthen to a moderate to fresh
breeze before gentle to moderate northwest flow returns. A new
longer period swell is entering the waters, creating hazardous
conditions for small craft later today into Wednesday morning.
