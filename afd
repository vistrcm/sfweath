.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 100 AM PDT Thu Jul 13 2023

Strong high pressure will bring rising temperatures for late week
into this weekend. The greatest potential for excessive heat will
arrive on Saturday into Sunday, with high temperatures in the 90s
to around 110. Overnight cooling will be limited, with a moderate
to high HeatRisk for the general population. Gradual cooling will
take place through early next week.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 230 AM PDT Fri Jul 14 2023

Key Points:
* Hot temperatures arrive Friday afternoon and evening
* Dangerous heat this weekend with highs in the 90s to 110 inland
* Limited overnight cooling in the hills with lows of 75 to 85
* Excessive Heat Warning inland areas for Saturday and Sunday
* Low relative humidity values with increased risk for fire starts

Technical Discussion:
The apex of a stout high pressure ridge will shift over Central
California into this evening. Warm and subsident conditions will be
associated with the 598 dm upper ridge as thicknesses rise and 850
mb temperatures climb to around 25 Celsius. This will kick off our
warming trend as interior temperatures rise well into the 90s to
around 105 degrees this afternoon. Temperatures for coastal areas
will be tempered thanks to onshore flow and a shallow marine layer
as the low-level winds turn north to northwest around a surface high
pressure center over the eastern Pacific. Therefore expect a quick
mix-out of coastal stratus and fog this morning with readings along
the coast and bays climbing into the 65-80 degree range. While
coastal and bayside locations will cool decently tonight with the
shallow marine layer in place, it will be a different story in the
hills. 925 mb temperatures (around 2,500 feet up) will be in the 27-
30 deg C (81-86 deg F) range, suggesting it will be quite warm in
the higher terrain well above the marine inversion. And with the
marine layer likely compressing to around 400-700 feet or so look
for lows in the hills to range from around 70 to 85 degrees tonight
given the thermal profile. These temperatures (today and tonight)
will produce a moderate HeatRisk for those who are sensitive to
heat, especially those without effective cooling or adequate
hydration.

.LONG TERM...
(Saturday through Thursday)
Issued at 230 AM PDT Fri Jul 14 2023

Saturday and Sunday:

The high pressure ridge will initially locate overhead before slowly
shifting east towards the Desert Southwest by Sunday. 850 mb
temperatures should rise into the 29-31 deg C range during this
time. These values, if realized, would not only exceed the daily
maximum values for KOAK, but would rank among the warmest ever
recored at KOAK per sounding climatology.

The peak of the heat event arrives this weekend. This is when the
combination of hot days and warm nights allows the HeatRisk to reach
the moderate to high range for inland areas. An Excessive Heat
Warning remains in effect during this time, indicating the likelihood
for for dangerous heat to impact much of the population. High
temperatures will reach 100 to 110 (locally up to 115) degrees for
the warmest inland locations (East Bay hills and valleys, southern
Santa Clara valley, northern Napa and Sonoma Counties, and inland
Monterey and southern San Benito Counties), with 90 to 100 degrees
expected elsewhere inland. Readings along the coast are a bit more
tricky, but the most likely forecast outcome should keep them a bit
cooler with a shallow marine layer in place. At this point, places
along the immediate coast and bays look to top out between 70 and 85
degrees. However, we`ll need to keep an eye on forecast changes just
in case the high pressure ridge becomes strong enough to fully
dissipate the marine layer. While not the most likely forecast
outcome, this could result in warmer temperatures along the coast
should it occur. Cooling Saturday night will be limited given the
warm air aloft with elevations above 1,000 feet likely remaining in
the 70s and 80s overnight. However low temperatures should dip into
the upper 50s to mid 60s within the lower (and more populated)
terrain. Look for a repeat on Sunday with high temperatures near, to
perhaps a few degrees cooler, than those experienced on Saturday.
Lows in the hills will remain quite warm and in the 70s and 80s.
While wind won`t be particularly strong this weekend, it`s noted
that relative humidity values should tank inland with limited
overnight recoveries above 500 feet. Given the abundance of cured
fine fuels (grasses) there remains a concern for wildfire ignitions
as it really won`t take much to get things going. So please do your
part to be "one less spark" this weekend. Otherwise key messages for
keeping safe in the heat are:

* Stay hydrated and cool (use public AC if needed: malls, libraries,
  movie theaters, etc)
* avoid outdoor activities between 1 to 6 pm, including walking your
  pets
* monitor the elderly, young, sick, pets, and livestock for heat
  sensitivity
* double check your vehicles making sure no people or pets are left
  inside while parked in the sun

Sunday Night and Monday:

Southerly steering flow will allow mid to high level moisture to
approach the region as high pressure shifts away to the east.
Precipitable water values climb to around 1 inch in this "monsoon-
like" pattern. The most likely forecast outcome is an uptick in mid
to high level cloud cover. However some forecast models do suggest a
little elevated instability is possible as a few weak impulses
rotate anticyclonically around the ridge periphery. Could we see any
convection from this? Right now the odds appear small, but it`s
worth watching as we fine tune the details of this time period going
forward. Otherwise look for the start of a cooling trend as onshore
flow strengthens and the marine layer deepens as upstream troughing
reaches the Pacific Northwest. Temperatures will still remain quite
warm for interior areas with highs in the 90s to around 100. However
coastal locations will be cooler with highs in the 60s to lower 70s.

Tuesday through Thursday:

The upper ridge will shift farther east thus allowing the upper flow
pattern to become more zonal. Look for stronger onshore flow and a
deeper marine layer as a result. This will bring cooler temperatures
and a reduced HeatRisk. Temperatures will trend closer to seasonal
by mid week with inland highs in the 80s and 90s and coastal highs
in the 60s and 70s.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 400 AM PDT Fri Jul 14 2023

Modest onshore flow and a 1000 feet deep marine layer have
allowed IFR-LIFR ceilings to prevail for all coastal terminals, in
addition to locations in the North Bay such as KSTS/KAPC. Patchy
and largely transient visibility reductions have also occurred in
BR/FG. Expect these conditions to continue through sunrise, with
ceilings rising and scattering out during the mid morning hours.
It`s possible clouds could hang on slightly longer around KMRY,
but still expect clearing by late morning at latest. VFR for all
terminals through early this evening, with a compressed marine
layer bringing a return to IFR-LIFR conditions for the coastal
terminals generally after 05-07Z. Breezy winds through the coastal
gaps this afternoon, otherwise winds should remain generally
light.

Vicinity of SFO...Moderate confidence in IFR stratus scattering
out around 15Z, but timing could be off by +/- one hour. VFR
through early evening with gusty onshore winds. Moderate
confidence in IFR stratus returning around/after 07Z tonight.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...IFR-LIFR stratus should persist through
15-17Z with gradual clearing towards the coast. KSNS likely
clearing to VFR 15-16Z with KMRY following an hour or so later.
VFR through early evening with light winds. Sub-VFR conditions
return tonight around/after 05Z.

.MARINE...
(Today through Wednesday)
Issued at 305 AM PDT Fri Jul 14 2023

Breezy to locally gusty northwest winds continue over the
northern waters through the weekend, slowly extending south over
the outer waters. The SF Bay and Delta will continue to see breezy
conditions each afternoon before winds diminish into the night.
These stronger winds will result in steep wind waves and hazardous
conditions to small craft. Mixed seas of light northerly and
moderate period (8-10 seconds) swell, and light southerly swell
continue through the weekend. Steeper wind waves expected next
week.
