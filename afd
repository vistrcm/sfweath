...New UPDATE...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 1257 AM PST Sun Feb 11 2024

An area of high pressure will result in tranquil weather this
Sunday and continue into early next week with chilly mornings to
persist. Unsettled weather is expected to return for the latter
half of the week and last throughout next weekend at the least.

&&

.UPDATE...
Issued at 840 AM PST Sun Feb 11 2024

Two near term weather impacts to start your Sunday, Fog and Frost.
Fog developed over the N Bay Valleys with a few cams and automated
sensors showing dense fog. Even seeing some dense fog near
Hollister as well. Clearing of fog will be slow going due to light
winds and passing high clouds. As for temperatures, it was another
chilly start to the day. Many locations around the region are near
or slightly colder than yesterday morning. Similar to Saturday
morning, the coldest temperatures are away from the coast and
urban areas. Once again a few spots in the upper 20s are showing
up in the interior Central Coast. Frost Advisory remains in effect
through 9 AM.

Despite some high clouds today, it will be a Super day weather
wise. Max temps will be in the 50s and 60s.

No update needed this morning. Will take a deeper dive into the
extended forecast with the afternoon package. Early look
continues to show impactful weather for the state Friday into next
weekend.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 1257 AM PST Sun Feb 11 2024

A Frost Advisory remains in effect until 9 AM PST this morning for
interior parts of the Central Coast and Eastern Santa Clara Hills.

For your Sunday, expecting mainly sunny conditions once any morning
fog has lifted (greatest potential over the North Bay) with high
temperatures in the upper 50s to lower 60s regionwide (40s for the
peaks). As the ridge continues to build over the region, expect
areas of fog to develop by late night and into the overnight hours,
again most likely over the North Bay Valleys.

Tonight, temperatures will cool into the low-to-mid 30s across the
interior portions of the Central Coast and Eastern Santa Clara Hills
where Frost Advisories once again have been posted for
tonight/tomorrow morning. Elsewhere, expecting mid/upper 30s to mid
40s.

.LONG TERM...
(Monday through next Saturday)
Issued at 158 PM PST Sat Feb 10 2024

While the weather is quiet over the region early next week the
focus should shift westward, way westward over the Pacific. Model
guidance continues to advertise a very stout 180+kt jet screaming
across the Pacific. This feature will likely jump start another
active pattern and re-open the storm door. As the jet moves
eastward a marked upper level divergent signature develops with
cyclogenesis at the surface. The initial pattern shift/change
returns by Wednesday as weak ripples moving through the upper
level flow bring light rain back to the region Wednesday and
Thursday. Not much in the way of impactful rain, but a few
hundredths to a tenth or two will be possible. A much stronger
system begins to take aim at CA as the upper level jet splits and
moves closer to the coast. The timeframe would be Friday into next
week. Still lots of uncertainty, but confidence continues to
increase for impactful weather next weekend with regards to wind
and rain. At this point, it doesn`t appear to be as strong as the
last system, but it is trending stronger. We`ll be watching it
closely over the next few days. No change from the CPC long range
highlighting the region for rain and wind Feb 17-23.
