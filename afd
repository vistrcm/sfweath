.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 1251 AM PDT Fri Oct 20 2023

Temperatures will be more mild today as stratus returns to coastal
areas. Swell heights are gradually abating offshore and along the
coast. Some rain is still expected Sunday.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 1251 AM PDT Fri Oct 20 2023

An approaching trough will move over coastal California today,
bringing onshore S-SW flow, cooler temperatures and partly cloudy
skies across the Bay Area today.

Low stratus returned Thu evening and has since spread north across
the coastal portions of the Bay Area. While the marine layer is
expected to gradually expand over the next 48 hours, it remains
compressed to about 1000 ft this morning. This is causing areas
of patchy fog and drizzle over the ocean, bays, and along the
coast. While ships and buoys typically don`t have visibility
sensors, they are reporting 100 percent RH with air temperatures
3-4 degrees below the sea surface temperature. This indicates
that fog is forming in the marine layer, and will likely continue
as the temperature drops further this morning. I also noticed some
light drizzle during my sunset run to Asilomar State Beach this
evening. The short term forecast has been adjusted to include both
patchy fog and light drizzle over the water and along the coast
until shortly after sunrise, with the threat of fog lasting
through mid morning. A dense fog advisory is possible later this
morning.

The sun should make an appearance by the afternoon, however some
coastal clouds will linger through the day. Clouds will be more
persistent along south facing coastlines. Temperatures are
expected to return to normal along the coast, but will take
another day to reach normal values inland. The exception is the
North Bay, where inland valleys will reach normal temperatures
today, and be well below normal by Sat.

.LONG TERM...
(Saturday through Thursday)
Issued at 1251 AM PDT Fri Oct 20 2023

As the Heat Advisory and High Surf Advisory are behind us, the
attention turns to weekend precipitation. A second, deeper trough
will move through late Saturday into Sunday. An associated cold
front will cross the Bay Area from NW to SE Sunday. Most of the
rain is expected to fall Sunday. The latest forecast has increased
the amount of rain to anywhere from 1/10"-1/4" for most coastal
areas, with up to 1/10" in the East Bay and South Bay. We
removed mention of thunderstorm potential. It`s still not out of
the question as a cold pocket of air is expected to move through
the upper atmosphere following the trough. The ECMWF, which is the
only model hinting at any noteworthy thunderstorm potential,
shows 300mb temperatures dropping to about -45C, but the timing
lags the mid-level moisture. Model soundings don`t show enough
instability to support any significant convection. The lowest
lifted index on NAM soundings was at Santa Rosa, between 750-500
mb, and that was only -1C. Everywhere else was positive,
indicating a stable lapse rate up to the middle atmosphere. The
NBM spit out a 5% chance of thunderstorms. In deference to the
ECMWF, we will continue to monitor the potential for
thunderstorms, but they have been removed from the official
forecast for now.

Monday looks dry before a slight chance of rain returns mid-week.
Temperatures will continue to gradually decrease through the
week, ending up about 5-10 degrees below normal by Friday.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 441 AM PDT Fri Oct 20 2023

Coastal fog, low stratus and patchy light drizzle /IFR/ developing
since late last evening continuing with a southerly wind reversal and
locally onshore winds. Inland it`s VFR so far. The marine layer will
continue to deepen today since lower level temperatures are cooling;
expect coastal terrain obscurations today, tonight and Saturday.

Vicinity of SFO...VFR, west to northwest wind 5 to 10 knots then a
wind shift to southwest 5 to 7 knots and MVFR ceiling due to stratus
this morning. Onshore wind essentially continuing through the period.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO

Monterey Bay Terminals...IFR in fog and stratus until late morning.
Ceilings lifting to MVFR by afternoon, HREF output shows ceilings
nearby all day. Patchy drizzle today. Stratus, fog, patchy drizzle
tonight and Saturday morning.

.MARINE...
(Today through Wednesday)
Issued at 432 AM PDT Fri Oct 20 2023

Hazardous seas continuing across the southern coastal waters
through the morning hours today. An area of low pressure over the
eastern Pacific will bring a chance of light rain to the coastal
waters and bays this weekend. Mainly light southerly winds except
breezy onshore winds across the San Francisco Bay north of the Bay
Bridge into the weekend. Winds becoming northwesterly and
increasing over the coastal waters early next week.

.BEACHES...
Issued at 1251 AM PDT Fri Oct 20 2023

While on an abating trend, long period northwest swell is still
resulting in hazardous conditions for beachgoers in the form of
sneaker waves and large surf. An enhanced risk for rip currents
also exists. High surf will gradually subside through Friday. Use
extreme caution and remain out of the water to avoid hazardous
swimming conditions. Remember to never turn your back on the
ocean.

.MTR WATCHES/WARNINGS/ADVISORIES...
CA...Beach Hazards Statement through late tonight for CAZ006-505-509-
     529-530.
