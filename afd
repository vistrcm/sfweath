.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 232 AM PDT Tue Oct 31 2023

A coastal trough is separating a pair of high pressure systems
centered about 500 mi east and west of the Bay Area. Temps today will
be a few degrees above normal with mostly sunny skies and light
offshore wind. Similar conditions Wednesday before a pattern shift
brings several weak cold fronts and rain chances back to the Bay
Area Thursday-Sunday.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 232 AM PDT Tue Oct 31 2023

The weather looks pleasant today with plenty of sunshine. A cool
morning will turn into a warm afternoon with high temperatures in
the 70s for most. Light offshore winds will flip to an onshore sea
breeze in the afternoon.

The trick-or-treat forecast is looking great. No chance of rain
tonight, and the temperature will remain in the 60s until 8pm for
most areas.

.LONG TERM...
(Wednesday through Monday)
Issued at 232 AM PDT Tue Oct 31 2023

Wednesday will be similar to Tuesday. Basically a nice sunny day
with light offshore wind and a warm afternoon. A weak cold front
arrives to Thursday. There is a slight-moderate chance of light rain
in the North Bay as the front moves through Thursday-Friday.
Regardless if any rain falls, this front will start to usher in
moist air and finally help the humidity recover from nearly a week
of dry conditions.

A pattern shift is in store late this week as the jet stream shifts
south to southern Oregon/far northern California. The GFS
currently has this pattern remaining pretty stable with upper
level zonal flow from Saturday through early next week. If this
holds, the door will be open for a series of weak cold fronts to
impact the Bay Area.

This set up is supporting better rain chances this weekend. The
current forecast calls for rain on both Saturday and Sunday, with
total accumulation ranging from 1/4-1/2" in the North Bay, down to
a few hundredths in Santa Clara and Santa Cruz counties.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 415 AM PDT Tue Oct 31 2023

High confidence for VFR at the terminals through the TAF period. Low
chance that patches of stratus offshore migrate over the immediate
coast. With high pressure dominant over the region, skies will
generally remain clear, save for some high clouds spilling over the
ridge, and winds light through the middle of the week. Light to
moderate sea breezes should develop across most of the area this
afternoon, diminishing in the evening.

Vicinity of SFO... VFR through the TAF period. Light winds through
the morning, with gentle west-northwest breezes this afternoon,
diminishing in the evening.

SFO Bridge Approach... Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals... VFR through the TAF period. Valley
drainage flows through the morning, building to around 15 knots at
SNS, before winds turn towards the northwest this afternoon before
diminishing in the evening.

.MARINE...
(Today through Sunday)
Issued at 415 AM PDT Tue Oct 31 2023

Light to moderate north winds persist through much of the week. A
light westerly swell with a moderate period continues through the
weekend along with a light long period southerly swell.

&&

.FIRE WEATHER...
Issued at 937 PM PDT Mon Oct 30 2023

Some fire weather concerns remain through Thursday as light offshore
winds continue to replenish dry air. The maximum relative humidity
values this morning are in the 35%-45% range across higher
elevations and interior valleys. Daytime minimum RH values are
expected to dip into the 15%-25% range, with single digits possible
in the Santa Lucias.

Expect marginal improvement over the next few days before a weak
cold front brings significantly higher humidity to the Bay Area
beginning Friday. There`s a moderate chance for light rain beginning
Thursday, and a good chance for wetting rain this weekend. Any
precipitation will be focused on the North Bay. Monterey and San
Benito counties only have a slight chance of measurable rain at this
time. Regardless of any rain, Humid conditions are expected to
persist into next week.
