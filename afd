.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 111 AM PST Fri Feb 7 2025

As the cold front departs the rain has tapered off. Throughout
the day the skies will clear and wind will ease. Cold mornings
arrive Saturday and persist through mid-week before rain returns.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 111 AM PST Fri Feb 7 2025

Mostly overcast skies persist this morning, though there are only
a few isolated showers remaining as a much drier air mass begins
to settle in. Friday will be a transition day from the low
pressure and associated fronts Thursday, and building Eastern
Pacific ridge and dry northerly flow that becomes entrenched this
weekend. The weather will improve through the day with decreasing
shower activity, cloud cover, and winds, and increasing sunshine
and good vibes.

.LONG TERM...
(Saturday through Thursday)
Issued at 111 AM PST Fri Feb 7 2025

While most of the impacts from the departing cold front will clear
out Friday, the cold air mass will remain in place. Combined with
the clear skies at night, morning temperatures will drop into the
30s inland and low 40s along the coast starting Saturday. That`s
roughly 10 degrees colder than this morning thanks to the lack of
clouds and enhanced radiational cooling. The 850 mb temperature
will hover between 0C and 3C through early next week, which is
around the 10th-25th percentile for this time of year. With this
combination, we could even threaten some low temperature records
across the Bay Area. For example, the existing minimum daily
temperature record at downtown SF is 38F at from Feb. 8
(Saturday) through Feb. 10 (Monday). The official forecast is
40-41 each of these days, but a probabilistic approach shows about
a 20% chance of dropping below the record 38 each day. While it`s
certainly no slam dunk, setting minimum temperature records is
becoming increasingly uncommon with urbanization and climate
change. In fact, for downtown SF the average year of existing
daily minimum temperature records throughout the month of February
is 1935, while the average year for daily highs in February is
1992. The air mass will also be quite dry. All 50 members of the
ECMWF ensemble bring the PWAT down to 0.2" by Sunday morning.
That`s below the 10th percentile in the sounding climatology for
Feb. This will make it hard to find a cloud in the sky over the
weekend. This pattern of cold mornings and clear, mild afternoons
will continue through early next week. More disturbed weather
returns mid-week, bringing rain back to the region. The
uncertainty has started to iron out, and a significant event is
now likely. The ECMWF ensemble shows high confidence we will
receive at least 1" of rain from Wednesday- Thursday. The GEFS
remains a little more conservative, but roughly 1/2 of the
solutions still show more than an inch in the low lands.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 334 AM PST Fri Feb 7 2025

Currently VFR at all terminals with the exception of SFO which is
recording a marginal MVFR ceiling. Rain shower activity continues to
taper off with a few rain showers offshore. Aside from these
potentially trekking over a terminal, high confidence in VFR
through the TAF period.

Vicinity of SFO...Currently MVFR with southwesterly flow. This
marginal MVFR ceiling is not expected to last long with VFR expected
to prevail through the TAF period. Winds will veer to become
northwesterly by this afternoon.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...Currently VFR with southerly flow at both
terminals. High confidence in VFR through the TAF period. Winds will
become northwesterly by this afternoon.
