...New UPDATE, MARINE...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 155 AM PDT Sun Nov 3 2024

Elevated fire weather concerns will persist into next week due to
dry conditions and offshore winds.

&&

.UPDATE...
Issued at 900 AM PST Sun Nov 3 2024

Generally clear throughout the region with a few lingering
stratus clouds in the higher elevations. The forecast for breezy
and gusty north to northeast winds today remains on track, with
drying potential expected as the winds continue through Monday
morning. The models are starting to converge on a stronger
offshore wind event Tuesday night through Thursday, but some
uncertainty remains in how quickly the fuels will respond to the
offshore winds today. No changes to the forecast at this time.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 155 AM PDT Sun Nov 3 2024

Today would be a great day to put away your outdoor Halloween
decorations if you haven`t already before the wind does it for you.
High pressure building into the Pacific Northwest and an upper-level
trough digging into the Great Basin will dominate the pattern
through tomorrow morning. The pressure gradient will tighten
throughout the day, supporting strong winds largely on the order of
20-30 mph with gusts up to 50 mph in the higher elevations. The
surface pressure gradient will support northerly (drying) winds in
bayside, coastal, and valley locations while the 925 mb pressure
gradient will support northeasterly/offshore winds in the higher
elevations. Fortunately the area is just coming off widespread
beneficial rainfall which will at least initially dampen fire
weather concerns. However, due to their lack of a westerly component
(no Pacific Ocean moisture) and the region that they come from
(land), northerly winds will lead to drying and
northeasterly/offshore winds will lead to compressional warming.
Just how much drying takes place in the next two days will be
crucial for fire weather concerns going into Tuesday night.

.LONG TERM...
(Monday through Saturday)
Issued at 155 AM PDT Sun Nov 3 2024

The pause button is hit on elevated fire weather concerns Monday
afternoon as the upper-level trough progresses off to the east,
allowing the pressure gradient to relax and winds to diminish.
Elevated fire weather concerns return Tuesday night as global
ensemble clusters are in agreement of high pressure building into
the Pacific Northwest and a reinforcing trough digging into the
Desert Southwest. High pressure to the north of low pressure to the
south forms something called a Rex block, this pattern in and of
itself comes with a lot of uncertainty as the onset and decay is not
handled well by numerical weather models. As for this specific
setup, uncertainty lies in the location and strength of the upper-
level trough. It is likely that the upper-level trough will become a
cutoff low, further increasing uncertainty as it would lack jet
stream support and thus be able to linger. All this to say, elevated
fire weather concerns are expected Tuesday night through Thursday
morning due to dry conditions and offshore winds. This event will be
heavily contingent upon how fuels respond to the winds preceding it
and how strong the offshore pressure gradient gets.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 348 AM PST Sun Nov 3 2024

With cold air aloft supporting a well mixed atmosphere, VFR
conditions are expected to persist through the TAF period,
although a few mid-level clouds are possible before 18Z. Building
high pressure off the coast will generate strong NW winds starting
late morning.

Vicinity of SFO...VFR conditions now look to continue through the
TAF period, with only a 5% chance of developing an MVFR ceiling
briefly this morning. Otherwise clear skies will dominate, with
strong NW wind in the afternoon.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...VFR conditions expected through the TAF
period with only a 10% chance of MVFR conditions this morning.
Strong onshore winds will develop this afternoon before easing
overnight.

.MARINE...
(Today through Friday)
Issued at 900 AM PST Sun Nov 3 2024

The strong Eastern Pacific subtropical high pressure system is
currently 1028 mb and will continue to strengthen and move closer
to the coast through the day. The gradient between this system and
a low pressure trough over California will support strong NNW
winds with gale force gusts across the majority of the exposed
marine zones. Buoys are reporting significant wave heights of 10
feet. Long period NW swell will arrive tonight, building combined
seas to 15 feet.

.FIRE WEATHER...
Issued at 115 PM PDT Sat Nov 2 2024

Slightly better outlook this morning for the first of two offshore
winds events progged for this upcoming week. Most areas received
beneficial rainfall overnight that will dampen fire weather
concerns slightly going into Sunday. However, vigilance is still
encouraged as we are early in the season and live fuels have not
accumulated much moisture thus far, so any potential benefit from
last night could be erased relatively easily as the offshore winds
continue into Monday morning. Current live fuel moisture forecast
still advertises ERCs around or above the 60th percentile by midweek.
Therefore, while the early week offshore event holds a slightly
more positive outlook, the midweek system could be more
concerning. By that time, live fuels would have had plenty of time
to dry out sufficiently, and there is considerable uncertainty
regarding the evolution of the pattern during the peak wind period
Wednesday. The RH forecast for Tuesday-Thursday will potentially
need to be nudged lower after losing some evapotranspiration
potential to the offshore winds earlier in the week that I suspect
some models may be holding on to. Will need to wait and see how
fuels respond early to the winds through Sunday, and will likely
have a much clearer picture of the midweek system by Monday.
