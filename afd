...New AVIATION, MARINE...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 1240 PM PDT Sun Sep 29 2024

A fall heat wave kicks off today and will last for several days.
A heat advisory is in effect for the entire Bay Area and Central
Coast through Wednesday night. Moderate and major HeatRisk will
likely lead to numerous heat-related impacts to those sensitive
to hot weather or without access to adequate cooling.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 1217 AM PDT Mon Sep 30 2024

The marine layer is quickly compressing from around 1500 ft this
weekend to below 500 ft by mid-day. This is in response to a
building 500 mb ridge extending from subtropical high pressure in
the Eastern Pacific. This higher pressure will cause subsidence
and compressional heating, as well as offshore winds overnight and
through the morning. While the forcing is generally weak, these
winds could be strong at some mountain peaks and passes. In fact,
a few observations in the North Bay Mayacamas range are reporting
near gale force winds and RH in the mid 20s and falling. A few of
the higher peaks are actually meeting red flag criteria, but the
winds are currently localized to the highest peaks.

The temperature will quickly rise under clear skies this morning.
Inland areas will reach 80 between 10 and 11 AM and climb into the
mid 90s shortly after noon. With offshore winds fighting the
marine layer, the coast will also feel the heat today. The warmer
microclimates in San Francisco should reach the mid to upper 80s
today with more heat in the following days. A sea breeze should
bring some late afternoon relief to the coast.

(Tuesday through Sunday)
Issued at 1217 AM PDT Mon Sep 30 2024

By Tuesday afternoon ensemble guidance is suggesting an 85% chance
that the 850 mb temperature will surpass 25 C. While warm weather
is common around here in October, it`s usually driven primarily by
offshore winds. This level of heat at roughly 5,000 ft is rare
in fall. Compared to all October soundings, it ranks in the top
99.8 percentile. The only time consecutive October soundings
measured an 850 mb temp above 25C was between October 1 - October
3 1980. Coincidentally 44 years ago to the day. That heat wave
brought 3 days of 90+ degrees to downtown SF, with a peak of 97
recorded on the 1st. We could very well see similar impacts this
week. Don`t be surprised if some daily records are set during the
peak on Tuesday. Since the offshore wind forcing is relatively
weak, the high afternoon temperatures should trigger a late
afternoon sea breeze, bringing evening relief along the coast.
You`ll certainly feel the sudden change when this happens.

Offshore winds will continue through the night Tuesday into
Wednesday morning. This period will bring the peak of fire weather
concerns, especially at higher elevations. Most terrain above
2,000 ft will stay in the mid 70s all night with very poor RH
recoveries in the 20s. With the stronger than expected winds
reported this evening, it`s not out of the question that red flag
warnings will be issued.

Onshore winds are expected to return Wednesday afternoon, which
should bring relief to coastal areas by Thursday and help
alleviate fire weather concerns. Inland areas are unfortunately
looking hot through Friday. Even late week inland temperatures
will be 15-20 degrees above normal. So when will it end? The
latest guidance shows a gradual cool-down through the weekend and
into the early part of next week. However, the guidance trend
over the last few days has been to extend the duration of this
heat wave.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 420 AM PDT Mon Sep 30 2024

VFR through the TAF period for all terminals. Building high pressure
and light offshore winds have worked in tandem to help erode and
compress much of the marine layer and any associated stratus
development. Light offshore (easterly) winds will persist through
the late morning before eventually flipping around to become
onshore out of the NW. Winds will generally be around 10 knots in
the afternoon. Into the overnight period of Monday into Tuesday,
winds become light once more, and redevelop an offshore component.

Vicinity of SFO...VFR through the TAF period. Breezy NW winds
develop this afternoon, but diminish into the nighttime, eventually
becoming light and easterly.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...VFR through the TAF period, high
confidence. Given the latest looks at the Ft. Ord profiler, the
marine layer continues to compress and erode, limiting any chances
of stratus development. Light SE winds will continue through the
late morning, with winds turning to become NW in the afternoon. A
return to light SE winds is expected in the late night tonight, or
early morning of Tuesday.

.MARINE...
(Today through Saturday)
Issued at 420 AM PDT Mon Sep 30 2024

Fresh to strong northwesterly winds continue over the waters
through late tonight, with gale-force gusts over the far northern
outer waters. Early Tuesday morning, northwesterly winds begin to
weaken and become moderate to fresh. Significant wave heights
will continue between 8 to 14 feet over the outer waters and
portions of the northern inner waters this morning, but begin to
abate this afternoon. Given elevated wave heights and wind gusts,
rough seas will persist over the outer waters through the day
today.

     CAZ006-502>506-508>510-512>518-528>530.

PZ...Small Craft Advisory until 9 AM PDT this morning for Pt Arena to
     Pt Reyes 0-10 nm.

     Gale Warning until 9 AM PDT this morning for Pt Arena to Pt
     Reyes 10-60 NM.

     Small Craft Advisory until 3 PM PDT this afternoon for Pigeon Pt
     to Pt Pinos 10-60 NM.
