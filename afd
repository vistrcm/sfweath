...New UPDATE, MARINE...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 227 AM PDT Mon Jul 22 2024

Heat ramps up today as the ridge builds over the Great Basin. Heat
Advisory and Excessive Heat Warning goes into effect today for
areas away from the coast. Cooling trend begins Thursday with
below normal temps by the weekend.

&&

.UPDATE...
Issued at 937 AM PDT Mon Jul 22 2024

Another cloudy start to the day along the coast and locally
inland. The marine layer is still holding near 1,000 feet, but
today features more patchy fog along the coast than seeing
widespread drizzle like over the weekend. Already starting to see
some erosion of inland cloud cover, but coastal areas will
struggle to clear with continue onshore flow. As noted below, the
bigger story for today will be the return of impactful heat. Given
the onshore flow, the warm up today will not be real notable along
the coast but interior locations. Not update needed for near term
forecast.

The main focus, and much deeper dive, on the afternoon forecast
package will be possible thunderstorms. As of right now there is a
very low but high impact scenario developing with upper level
moisture streaming over the region Tuesday into Wednesday. Will
be coordinating with neighboring offices and fire partners.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 227 AM PDT Mon Jul 22 2024

Heat highlights go into effect today as the heat begins to ramp
up. This will be in the form of an Excessive Heat Warning for the
far interior and a Heat Advisory for the North Bay, Santa Cruz
Mtns, and the southern Salinas Valley. We`ve started to see some
signs of marine layer compression this morning per the Fort Ord
vertical profiler and slightly lower ceilings compared to last
night. A sign of things to come over the next few days as the
high pressure builds aloft. However, in contrast to what was
mentioned a couple of nights ago about the deepening of the marine
layer cooling off higher elevations effectively, the opposite has
happened overnight. Lower elevations still in the marine layer are
running right around where they were 24 hours ago, but with its
compression, higher elevations above about 1000 feet are running
10-15 degrees warmer. This is as expected and doesn`t really mean
anything notable with the upcoming heat. Just a fun observation
and a handy way to diagnose subtle changes in the marine layer.

FROM PREVIOUS...

Further strengthening of the ridge will continue through
Wednesday. The airmass associated with the ridge will yield 850mb
temperatures in the upper 20C range. While these values are well
above the 90th percentile and near the daily moving max (per KOAK
sounding climo) they are not the same as what we saw earlier in
July. Not expecting records to break for max temperatures.
Regardless dangerous heat is still expected and heat related
hazards will remain through at least Wednesday. Tuesday will
likely be the hottest day with far inland locations in the
100-108F range with major to extreme HeatRisk. These areas have
the greatest likelihood for heat related illnesses. Not just for
the young/elderly, but everyone who doesn`t take precautions.
Stay hydrated, limit afternoon outdoor activities, and never leave
pets/children in a vehicle. As previously mentioned, the marine
layer will keep the coast cooler, but given the airmass potential
above normal temperatures are expected. The ridge begins to shift
eastward late Wednesday into Thursday as an upper level low moves
northward on the western periphery of the ridge. The shifting
ridge and approaching upper low will initiate a cooling. Thursday
will feature some cooling inland, but more widespread cooling is
expected Friday and into next weekend.

The other item of note will be the influx of upper level moisture
Tuesday into Wednesday as the ridge to the east and upper low to
the west allow for southerly flow aloft. PWATs will increase over
the region as earlier as Tuesday, but peak Tuesday night into
Wednesday at 200% of normal for late July. While there is ample
moisture aloft instability is somewhat lacking. Guidance shows
decent MUCAPE and marginal lapse rates, but CINH/inhibition is
also pronounced. Would like to see less CINH before introducing
tstorms over the forecast area. For now, will keep mentioning a
non-zero chance, but more likely for increasing mid-high level
clouds. We`ll be watching this closely as it could have big fire
weather impacts.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 433 AM PDT Mon Jul 22 2024

Coastal stratus and fog /LIFR-IFR/ continues to develop this
morning, inland it`s VFR. Stratus and fog will mix out to near the
coastline by late morning. Patchy coastal stratus and fog /LIFR-IFR/
redeveloping tonight and Tuesday morning.

Vicinity of SFO...VFR. Light northwest wind shifting to light
northeast wind this morning, wind then onshore 10 to 12 knots in
the afternoon and early evening.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...Stratus and fog /LIFR-IFR/ including patchy
light drizzle this morning, stratus and fog mixing out near noon
today. Patchy stratus and fog /LIFR-IFR/ redeveloping tonight and
Tuesday morning. Winds will be mainly onshore 5 to 15 knots.

.MARINE...
(Today through Saturday)
Issued at 937 AM PDT Mon Jul 22 2024

The pressure gradient between high pressure over the Eastern
Pacific Ocean and low pressure over the Southwest will allow for
northwesterly breezes to remain strong through tomorrow. As high
pressure retrogrades to the west, the pressure gradient will be
allowed to relax and winds will be allowed to diminish.
Significant wave heights will abate through the forecast period.
Non-zero thunderstorm chances exist for Tuesday into Wednesday.
