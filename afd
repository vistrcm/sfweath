...New AVIATION, MARINE...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 1204 PM PDT Mon Jul 31 2023

Seasonal temperatures continue this week with a slight cooldown
through midweek. High pressure nudges closer to our region late
week with above average temperatures expected by the weekend.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 220 AM PDT Tue Aug 1 2023

Central California remains along the western periphery of expansive
mid-upper ridging encompassing much of the interior west and
southern Great Plains. With troughing to our north the upper jet
will extend across the Bay Area with southwest flow aloft
transporting periodic moisture and providing scattered to broken
high level clouds. Otherwise no real changes in the sensible weather
department. Area profilers suggest some minor fluctuations in the
marine layer depth, but overall it appears to be in the neighborhood
of 800 to 1,400 feet early this morning. Some deepening is likely
over the next 24 hours as the upper trough impinges on our area from
the north, with breezy northwest winds transporting a cool maritime
airmass inland. Expect cooler temperatures by a few degrees across
the board today, with 60s to lower 70s along the coast and bays,
with 80s to near 90 for the warmest inland spots. Low clouds will
gradually clear towards the coast during the late morning to early
afternoon hours. However area beaches, southern Monterey Bay, and
western San Mateo county may remain in the clouds all day. Expect
clouds to quickly expand back into the favorable near-coastal
valleys during the early to mid evening hours. Low temperatures
tonight will be mostly in the 50s.

.LONG TERM...
(Wednesday through Monday)
Issued at 220 AM PDT Tue Aug 1 2023

Our tug-of-war will continue between a persistent low pressure area
aloft over the northeast Pacific and a stout high pressure ridge
across the southwest U.S. and northern Mexico. The trough should win
out through Thursday with a continuation of onshore winds, a deeper
marine layer, and cool temperatures. Thereafter the upper ridge
should expand towards SoCal with our area locating along its
fringes. While upper heights will rise, a consensus of the
deterministic models and their ensembles don`t favor the ridge axis
setting up overhead as the upper trough erodes its northwest corner.
Regardless, still expect a warming trend for interior areas this
weekend with a moderate HeatRisk developing away from the coast. Not
seeing a signal for excessive and/or prolonged heat however as
shortwave impulses continue eroding the northern extent of the upper
ridge by early next week.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 420 AM PDT Tue Aug 1 2023

MVFR-IFR stratus blanketing most of the coastal terminals, with
dissipation around 17-19Z. Low to moderate confidence in clearing
time/extent for KOAK and KMRY, and it`s possible ceiling at KMRY
could persist all day. Breezy onshore flow this afternoon and
early this evening. Stratus returns early this evening around
02-03Z for the coastal terminals, with increased inland coverage
overnight and into Wednesday morning.

Vicinity of SFO...IFR-MVFR clouds have remained near, but not
over, the terminal so far. Still medium potential for a ceiling
to develop, with the greatest odds between roughly 14-16Z. Stratus
clears out around 17-18Z with a return to VFR. Northwest wind
gusts to around 25 kt this afternoon and early evening. Low clouds
return early this evening with better potential for MVFR ceiling
development around 03-04Z. Ceiling should persist through the
remainder of the TAF period.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...IFR-LIFR ceilings persist. Gradual
clearing towards the coast this afternoon. KSNS returns to VFR
around 19Z. Less confidence in KMRY, which could maintain a
ceiling all day. For now retained VFR window between 21-00Z but
this is low to medium confidence at best. IFR-LIFR ceilings
overnight for all terminals. Some visibility reductions in FG/BR
near the coast this morning and again later tonight. Covered this
potential with a TEMPO at KMRY between 13 and 15Z.

.MARINE...
(Today through Sunday)
Issued at 406 AM PDT Tue Aug 1 2023

Breezy northwest winds today over the waters as an upper low
passes overhead with increasing surface pressure gradients along
the coast. The breezy nw winds will produce steep wind waves while
a small southerly swell passes through the waters. A general trend
for continued nw winds and light seas continues through the week.
