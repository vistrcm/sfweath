.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 313 AM PST Tue Nov 26 2024

Light rain continues across the Central Coast through mid morning
before rain chances taper off late morning/early afternoon. After
this system departs, a cooler and drier air mass will move in with
overnight lows dropping into the 30s Wednesday through Friday. Dry
conditions will persist through the Thanksgiving holiday weekend.

&&

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 313 AM PST Tue Nov 26 2024

Light rain continues throughout the Central Coast and southern most
portions of the South Bay. 36 hour rain totals have been highest
over the Central Coast with most locations seeing between 0.5" to 1"
with the exception of the Santa Lucia Range where totals have ranged
from 1" to 3". Both HRRR and ECMWF guidance show the main offshore
moisture plume oriented to the south of our CWA with the highest
precipitable water values in our area across southern Monterey
County. Given the more southerly setup of this system, it makes
sense as to why the highest 36 hour rain totals are within the
southern most portions of the Santa Lucia Mountain Range. Showers
will taper off first across the northern Central Coast by mid
morning but will linger through the late morning across southern
Monterey County. By the afternoon, widespread dry conditions will
return to the region as the main moisture plume shifts further south
and a dry air mass moves in. This will mark the end of our recent
rainy period with confidence increasing that dry conditions will
persist through at least the end of this week.

Morning low temperatures are running about 2 to 6 degrees warmer,as
of 2:30AM, than they were at this time yesterday. This is in
agreement with our 00Z (4PM) sounding which showed decent warm air
advection in the lowest levels. Low temperatures will generally stay
in the mid 40s to low 50s with portions of the higher elevations
dipping into the low 40s. Daytime high temperatures will stay on the
chillier side with highs generally peaking in the upper 50s to low
60s.

.LONG TERM...
(Wednesday through Monday)
Issued at 313 AM PST Tue Nov 26 2024

As our current system continues to exit to our south, a drier and
cooler air mass will move in and bring with it much cooler overnight
lows Wednesday through the weekend. Lows will drop into the upper
30s beginning Wednesday with lows expected to drop further into the
low to mid 30s Thursday and Friday. Wednesday night into Thursday
morning will be the coldest night this week with temperatures
hovering around freezing across much of the interior Bay Area and
Central Coast. As such, a Frost Advisory has been issued for
interior portions of the Bay Area and Central Coast for temperatures
as low as 32 degrees. Overnight lows will generally return to the
low to mid 40s Saturday through the end of the forecast period while
the coldest spots in the interior Central Coast and North Bay
valleys lingering in the upper 30s. During the day on Friday, we
will start to see temperatures warming slightly into the mid to
upper 60s as upper level ridging builds over the West Coast. High
temperatures will remain about 5 degrees above normal across the
interior beginning Friday through early next week with CPC guidance
continuing above average temperatures through early December.
Directly along the coastline, temperatures will stay closer to
normal in the low to mid 60s. In terms of precipitation, upper level
ridging will result in drier conditions across our forecast area
beginning late Tuesday through the end of the forecast period.
Longer term guidance continues ridging over the Pacific/West Coast
for the first week of December with CPC guidance showing drier than
normal conditions across our area through December 9th.
