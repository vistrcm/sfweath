(Today and tonight)
Issued at 139 AM PST Wed Dec 4 2024

Cooler and moister conditions in addition to the lack of cloud cover
is allowing for fog to be observed in greater extent than it was 24
hours ago with North Bay Valleys and Monterey Bay being the victims
thus far. Expect patchy dense fog in coastal and valley locations
through mid-morning so be sure to turn on your low-beam headlights,
drive slowly, and keep your distance from other vehicles. Above
normal temperatures and dry conditions will continue as longwave
ridging remains parked over the region. While too young to be
climate sites (less than 30 years old), STS broke and CCR and HWD
tied the records for daily maximum temperature on December 3rd. STS
reached 68 degrees breaking the previous record of 66 degrees set in
2011 and again in 2016. CCR reached 67 degrees tying the previous
record set in 2007. Similarly HWD reached 67 degrees tying the
previous record set in 2007 and again in 2014.

.LONG TERM...
(Thursday through Tuesday)
Issued at 139 AM PST Wed Dec 4 2024

A weak shortwave will skirt Northern California on Thursday, with
the most likely effect being a brief pause in the warming trend due
to increased cloud cover. A Rex Block pattern will develop in the
shortwave`s wake as a ridge of high pressure noses into the Pacific
Northwest and low pressure develops over the Desert Southwest. A
second, stronger shortwave will skirt the region on Saturday
bringing an end to the warming trend with increasing cloud cover.
