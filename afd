.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 1210 AM PST Tue Feb 18 2025

A cold front will bring light rain to the North Bay Wednesday, and
more widespread gusty winds from Wednesday through Thursday. A
warming trend will follow, with temperatures climbing 5-10
degrees above normal by the weekend.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 1210 AM PST Tue Feb 18 2025

Quiet weather will continue today with increasing clouds, gentle
winds and mild temperatures. Temperatures are currently in the mid
40s to low 50s. Mostly clear skies will allow radiational cooling
to drop the temperature another 5-10 degrees by dawn. A 500 mb
short wave ridge will continue building through the morning, with
the axis moving through in the late afternoon. 850 mb
temperatures will climb from around 5C to 10C over the next 24
hours due to warm air advection ahead of Wednesday`s cold front.
This won`t translate to much warming at the surface, however as
the approaching front will also bring increasing cloud cover
through the second half of the day. Afternoon temperatures are
only expected to reach the upper 50s to mid 60s, which is pretty
typical for this time of year.

.LONG TERM...
(Wednesday through Monday)
Issued at 1210 AM PST Tue Feb 18 2025

By Wednesday morning the WPC surface prog shows the cold front
just off the coast of northern California, anchored by a 997 mb
low pressure system off the coast of central Oregon. Light,
prefrontal stratiform rain will likely fall in the North Bay
through the early morning, with a few drops possible further
south. With only 1/10" or so expected, this rain will not cause
any significant impacts. This front will clear out pretty quick,
with high pressure quickly building in its wake. The skies will
start to clear before the sun sets on Wednesday. There will be
some gusty northerly winds both Wednesday and Thursday, but they
will likely stay below wind advisory criteria (40 mph gusts) and
the recent forecast trend has backed off a bit.

Late week the story shifts to a warming trend, especially south
of San Franciso. A more persistent ridge builds from Thursday
through Monday, allowing a warmer, subtropical airmass to move
in. By the weekend, temperatures will be 5-10 degrees above
normal. There will be enough moisture and cloud cover to keep
overnight temperatures mild. With afternoon temperatures in the
mid 60s to mid 70s, no rain, and light wind, it`s actually going
to be quite nice this weekend. Once they get here, the warm
temperatures will last into the first half of next week. Ensemble
guidance gets pretty split in the extended range, as a notoriously
hard to predict cut-off low may develop in the NE Pacific late
next week. Basically, don`t put too much trust in any forecast
beyond next Wednesday as the uncertainty really starts to balloon.

Moderate west swell 10 to 12 feet at 14 to 15 seconds today. This
