...New UPDATE, MARINE...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 159 AM PST Sat Mar 2 2024

A cold front is moving through the Bay Area early this morning.
Showers and strong westerly wind will continue Saturday before
tapering off Sunday. Cold temperatures will persist through
Monday.

&&

.UPDATE...
Issued at 847 AM PST Sat Mar 2 2024

Wind speeds have fallen below criteria as of mid-morning and thus
the Wind Advisory has been cancelled for higher elevations across
the Bay Area and Central Coast. Otherwise, isolated to scattered
rain showers and isolated thunderstorms will continue throughout the
afternoon and evening. No additional updates anticipated at this
time.

&&

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 159 AM PST Sat Mar 2 2024

The surface cold front is currently moving through the Bay Area.
Doppler radar velocity data and higher elevation anemometers are
indicating winds are gusting as high as 55 mph as the frontal
boundary passes. Rain showers continue, although the coverage has
decreased overnight. The post-frontal environment will likely
continue to support this lull in precipitation Saturday morning,
and there will even be some sunshine. By Saturday afternoon, the
combination of surface heating and cold middle levels will
decrease the stability and will likely lead to a final round of
strong showers and possible low-topped thunderstorms. Winds will
subtly shift from SW to westerly behind the front, and remain
strong through the day.

&&

.LONG TERM...
(Sunday through Friday)
Issued at 159 AM PST Sat Mar 2 2024

High pressure will quickly build behind the front and the gradient
will relax by Sunday. There may still be a few showers, but they
will be lighter than Thu-Sat. Winds will also be lighter on
Sunday, but there will still be a moderate westerly breeze in the
afternoon. The biggest impact will shift from wind and rain to
cold morning temperatures. The low temps on Sunday and Monday
morning are expected to range from mid-30s to low-40s.

A weak system will move through in the middle of the week. This
will keep the cooler temperatures, cloud cover, and light rain
chances in the forecast through Tuesday or Wednesday. High
pressure finally rebuilds late week. Thursday and Friday look to
be clear and calm, with more normal temperatures. For example, the
Thursday high temperature at Santa Rosa is expected to climb back
to the mid-60s for the first time in a week.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 333 AM PST Sat Mar 2 2024

Showers and isolated storms continue through the TAF period. Breezy
westerly winds will persist through the day with gusts up to 20-25
knots, diminishing overnight into Sunday. LLWS concerns continue
this morning as winds aloft lag surface winds in an expected
diminishing from the higher gusts of the previous night. VFR
conditions with mid-level clouds are generally expected, with
potentials for lower ceilings and reduced visibilities within the
most intense showers.

Vicinity of SFO... Breezy west to west-southwest winds through the
day with gusts up to 20-25 knots before diminishing tonight into
Sunday morning. Shower activity continues through the TAF period.
Generally VFR with periods of MVFR cigs with the most intense
showers.

Monterey Bay Terminals... Breezy to gusty southwest winds through
the day, with gusts reaching 28 knots at SNS. LLWS concerns continue
through the morning as winds aloft remain strong. Shower activity
continues through the TAF period, bringing reduced visibilities and
MVFR cigs.

.MARINE...
(Today through Thursday)
Issued at 847 AM PST Sat Mar 2 2024

Shower and storm chances continue this morning with the highest
thunderstorm probabilities in the northern waters. Slightly
increased thunderstorm chances will linger into the early evening
before diminishing overnight. Near gale force southwest to
westerly winds, with the occasional gale force gust possible, are
beginning to diminish. As winds continue to diminish, moderate to
strong westerly to northwesterly winds will continue through the
remainder of the weekend. Rough to high northwest swell lasts
through the weekend before beginning to weaken by mid next week
when a new northwest swell train starts to arrive. Dry conditions
and light northwest winds build into the next work week.
