...New AVIATION, MARINE...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 215 AM PDT Wed Sep 27 2023

Overall quiet weather in store through the end of the week with
breezy afternoons and evenings. Beach Hazards Statement in effect
this afternoon as elevated surf may still be dangerous for beach
goers. Upper low dips down into CA this weekend, which may bring
isolated, slight precip chances as well as cooler temperatures.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 215 AM PDT Wed Sep 27 2023

Nighttime satellite imagery is relatively clear/quiet early this
AM with limited coastal stratus coverage. Low clouds will struggle
to redevelop overnight and any that does will stay confined to
the coastline as marine layer inversion is not really present (00z
sounding shows weak inversion around 6000 feet). Cold air
advecting into the area overnight won`t help to re-establish the
marine layer either. However, we could see some patchy fog may
develop in the hills tonight thanks to clear skies aiding in
radiative cooling, lowering dew point depressions.

Generally nice weather expected for the day today with clear
conditions and near seasonable temperatures. Highs today near the
coast will be in the mid 60s, bayside in the low to mid 70s, and
further inland in the low 80s. Breezy to locally gusty conditions
looking probable tomorrow as both onshore and northerly gradients
will increase during the afternoon/evening as strong low pressure
(which is currently offshore the Pacific NW) moves inland into
the N Rockies today.

In addition, large breaking waves and increased rip current risk
still continues along the coastline. The large NW swell is
diminishing and no longer meets High Surf Advisory criteria, but
elevated surf still possible today so Beach Hazards Statement is
now in effect through the afternoon today. See BEACHES for more.

.LONG TERM...
(Thursday through Tuesday)
Issued at 215 AM PDT Wed Sep 27 2023

Slightly warmer temperatures expected Thursday across the
interior. Breezy onshore flow continues during the
afternoon/evening.

By late Friday into Saturday, an upper low will dig southward from
the Pacific NW into CA. The latest runs of GFS and Euro (and
their ensembles) have shifted the trough axis more westerly when
it dips south, which would favor wetter conditions and onshore
flow. The official forecast now features a slight chance for rain
Friday into Saturday, mostly across coastal terrain and the
interior portion of the CWA. For example, guidance for Livermore
Airport shows a majority of its GFS and ECMWF ensemble members
showing light precip accumulations this weekend. However, the
trajectory of the low could still change, which would affect
precip chances, so stay tuned. Temperatures this weekend will be
cooler as this upper low brings in a cooler airmass.

As trough exits east Sun into next week, could still see some
northerly winds across the interior. Will continue to monitor as
details become clearer in coming days.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 437 AM PDT Wed Sep 27 2023

A mix of both VFR and MVFR as North Bay is experiencing lower
visibility. Expect VFR conditions to prevail for all terminals
closer to 17Z. Moderate confidence that CIGs will return tonight for
Monterey Bay but high confidence that remaining terminals, with the
exception of North Bay, will remain VFR through the TAF period.
Models suggest a mix of LIFR/IFR/MVFR conditions for terminals in
the North Bay overnight but had low confidence to include in TAFs as
a prevailing condition, but TEMPO was placed for lower visibility
overnight. N/NW winds will become breezy this afternoon then will
return to light/moderate tonight.

Vicinity of SFO...VFR conditions continue with moderate onshore
winds. N/NW winds will become breezy and gusty this afternoon up to
30 kt. A few models suggest winds above 35 kt, therefore will
continue to monitor if any AWW is necessary.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...VFR with high confidence that VFR will
prevail through most of the day. Models suggest VFR will prevail
through the TAF period, but had higher confidence to include MVFR
ceilings returning overnight. Onshore winds will become breezy this
afternoon with chances of gusty winds near the Salinas Valley up to
18 kt. Expect winds to return to moderate/light tonight.

.MARINE...
(Today through Monday)
Issued at 437 AM PDT Wed Sep 27 2023

Fresh to strong northwesterly winds continue with winds becoming
strong to near gale into Wednesday afternoon, with gale- force
conditions developing by Wednesday evening for much of the outer
waters along with favored coastal jet regions. Large northwest
swell continues to slowly diminish through the next couple of
days, but large wind waves begin to build overnight tonight and
persist through the weekend. Both winds and waves will combine to
create dangerous conditions for small craft through the remainder
of the week.

&&

.BEACHES...
Issued at 215 AM PDT Wed Sep 27 2023

NW swell continues to move through the coastal waters and will
diminish through the day today. Currently, the swell is around 10
to 11 feet at 14 seconds. The High Surf Advisory was allowed to
expire, but was replaced by a Beach Hazards Statement to account
for lingering dangerous conditions. Large breaking waves still
possible around 12 to 15 feet. Coastal buoys as of 2 AM continue
to show elevated seas with significant wave heights around 12-14
feet at 14 seconds.

Continue to exercise caution even though the high surf advisory has
ended, as energy in the ocean can be slow to diminish and large
waves may continue to be present afterwards until fully dissipated.
