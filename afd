...New AVIATION...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 439 AM PDT Thu Jun 8 2023

Subtle warming trend into the weekend, though daytime highs will
still be 2-10 degrees below normal. Another closed upper low is
expected to develop early next week, bringing a very slight chance
for rain and cooling temperatures back down to the 10-15 degrees
below normal territory. Deep marine layer persists maintaining the
daily cadence of low clouds pushing inland overnight then
clearing by late morning.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 439 AM PDT Thu Jun 8 2023

Satellite showing a continued mix of high and low clouds. However,
the inland intrusion of marine stratus is not as extensive as
we`ve seen in prior days. Our forecast area (SF & Monterey Bay
regions) will be in a fairly benign weather pattern today as the
upper low tracks into the Great Basin and weakens.

Current temperatures are within a degree or two of what they were
24 hours ago and we expect drier conditions today. Afternoon highs
will begin a subtle warming trend this afternoon. Highs will range
60s along the coast to the upper 70s and low 80s well inland. Winds
will be fairly light for much of the morning with typical breezy
conditions developing across the Bays and into the valleys this
afternoon and evening. Wind gusts could get up to around 20 mph.

If one were to travel outside of the Bay Area/Central CA, then
take note that showers with potential thunderstorms are forecast
to develop again over the Sierra as well as far NorCal.

.LONG TERM...
(Friday through Wednesday)
Issued at 439 AM PDT Thu Jun 8 2023

The upper low will weaken moreso over the weekend and transition
into a broader trough pattern. As that occurs, the airmass aloft
will warm as weak ridging aloft develops and this will aid in the
gradual warming trend today into Saturday. This warming trend will
be somewhat noticeable inland, however, thermometers along the
coast should stay somewhat similar.

As we get into Saturday evening into Sunday, another trough digs
southward over the Eastern Pacific Ocean. Then another upper level
closed low is forecast to develop offshore of SoCal. Expect a
gentle dip in temperatures on Sunday with that cooler air moving
in. In addition, we could see additional light shower activity
associated with that low. However, ensemble models have been very
consistent that any rain amounts will be quite light (< 0.10") for
early next week.

Is it abnormal to get rain in June? We`ve been hearing that
question a lot recently. It may seem abnormal since CA has been
in a multi-year drought prior to the winter full of Atmospheric
Rivers we just had. However, it is common to get a bit of rain in
June. Here`s a few of our official climate sites and what the
monthly precipitation normals are in June:

Santa Rosa: 0.29"
Napa: 0.29"
Livermore: 0.12"
Downtown SF: 0.20"
Oakland: 0.20"
San Jose: 0.18"

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 520 AM PDT Thu Jun 8 2023

A mix of VFR and MVFR as satellite shows stratus lingering mostly
over the North Bay. Expect all terminals to clear to VFR near 17-18Z
this morning with moderate confidence that MVFR cigs will return
tonight. Models disagreement lies between VFR and MVFR ceilings
returning tonight, but due to persistence, MVFR ceilings were
included in the TAFs. Will continue to monitor for any changes
needed. Onshore winds are expected to become breezy during the late
morning/early afternoon today but will return to moderate to light
winds tonight.

Vicinity of SFO...VFR conditions are expected to prevail mostly
today through midnight. Moderate confidence that MVFR cigs return
after midnight. Winds are expected to become breezy/gusty near 18Z
but moderate confidence exact wind speed, but expect up to 20 knots.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...VFR conditions prevail throughout the
Monterey Bay terminals but there is a chance that some stratus may
build to MVFR but had low confidence to include in TAFs. Winds are
expected to become moderate/breezy today but will transition back to
light winds by the end of the night.

&&

.MARINE...
(Today through Tuesday)
Issued at 309 AM PDT Thu Jun 8 2023

Fairly light southerly winds persist over the waters and may
become breezy in the afternoon and evening hours. Winds shift to
the northwest on Friday and build through the weekend. Mixed seas
continue with a series of northwesterly and southerly swells
through the waters.
