...New UPDATE...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 255 AM PDT Sun Oct 20 2024

Very dry airmass lingers through Sunday, but with much less wind.
Improving moisture through this week with slight rain chances for
the North Bay by the end of this week.

&&

.UPDATE...
Issued at 926 AM PDT Sun Oct 20 2024

No update to the forecast is necessary this morning. Dry airmass
lingers today with relatively light winds area wide. Elevated to
near critical fire weather concerns will persist through late
afternoon. Avoid any activities that could spark a wildfire.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 255 AM PDT Sun Oct 20 2024

A very dry airmass in the wake of the offshore wind event is still
in place and expected to remain so through today. Vast
improvements in the wind, however, with the peak wind around the
region this morning at only 16 mph at Mt. St. Helena. Quite a
spread of overnight relative humidity improvements as well, with
many locations seeing at least a 5-10% increase in RH compared to
24 hours ago...some locations up 30-35%. The overall trend in
moisture is going in the right direction, but the RH will still be
well in the ballpark of elevated fire concerns today. Again, the
main culprit for not having a Red Flag Warning today is the lack
of wind. Otherwise, overall fire danger remains high due to the
very dry conditions.

.LONG TERM...
(Monday through Saturday)
Issued at 255 AM PDT Sun Oct 20 2024

Moisture increases through this week as onshore flow returns to
"normal". However, elevations above about 1000 feet may be a bit
slower to recover as the marine layer stays relatively compressed.
This will change as a series of upper level disturbances are set
to move through the region over the next several days. These upper
troughs will help to deepen the marine layer and restore moisture
to higher elevations, and perhaps bring some light drizzle to
coastal and favored upslope areas Monday, and more notably,
Friday. The upper level pattern out of the Gulf of Alaska remains
quite active through the next 7 days, but that doesn`t come
without uncertainty. Beyond the middle of this week, uncertainty
among ensemble guidance increases regarding rain chances. The next
target we would be eyeing for any beneficial light rainfall
chances would be the Thursday night-Friday timeframe, but this
will take another couple of days to be sorted out to provide any
more beneficial and confident messaging.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 420 AM PDT Sun Oct 20 2024

VFR with light breezes. Offshore flow dominates through the morning
hours, followed by onshore flow in the afternoon and evening. Model
output is starting to show a compressed fog and stratus deck
returning to the coastal terminals, but confidence is low and have
opted to keep terminals scattered for now. Will monitor the
evolution of the marine layer through the day, TAFs will be amended
if the chance for stratus development increases.

Vicinity of SFO... VFR today. Light and variable winds this morning,
then a light breeze from the west-northwest during the afternoon and
evening. Low confidence in stratus development early Monday morning,
with a greater chance near OAK.

SFO Bridge Approach... Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals... VFR today. Light offshore flow continues
through the morning hours with onshore winds developing this
afternoon and evening. Low confidence for potential LIFR stratus and
fog developing this evening.

.MARINE...
(Today through Friday)
Issued at 420 AM PDT Sun Oct 20 2024

The gradient between high pressure over the eastern Pacific and a
trough over California continues to relax and winds have
diminished to a gentle to moderate breeze. A weak cold front
pushes through on Monday, but only builds winds back to a
moderate breeze. Sea heights remain moderate at 4-8 feet through
the week.

.MTR WATCHES/WARNINGS/ADVISORIES...
