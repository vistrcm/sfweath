.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 310 AM PDT Sat Sep 14 2024

Stratus has returned to much of the Central California
coastline, painting a much different picture than the previous night
in which the coastline was bare. The Salinas valley and Monterey Bay
are coated in a sheet of white as the stratus pushes in. Meanwhile,
it is clear and cool inland with current temperatures sitting in the
50s and 60s for most locations.

Low pressure continues to dominate the stage over the weekend and
extending into the long term. Cooler, more seasonal temperatures are
expected once again today with highs generally in the mid to upper
80s for the interior, and 70s around the SF Bay. Highs in the low
60s will be the theme for the coastline. Breezy onshore winds will
increase in the afternoon, and continue into the nighttime of
Saturday into Sunday. In this overnight period tonight, winds will
slowly increase as a cold front approaches, associated with an
approaching low pressure system out of the northwest. However, the
strongest winds will occur Sunday afternoon and evening with
gusts in lower elevations reaching 25-30mph, and in higher
elevations, 35- 45mph. So hold on to your hats and fold up those
patio furniture umbrellas (lest you should want to recreate a
scene from Mary Poppins)! It`ll be a bit windy Sunday before and
after the frontal passage, so take some extra consideration this
weekend to perhaps just bring in anything that can be easily blown
over. As of now, no wind products are necessitated. Just be aware
of what is in the forecast!

Though, winds are not all. As we`ve said before, and will say again
here, there does exist the chance for rain with this system. Any
rain that does fall will not be much, but it will be just enough to
wet the ground and perhaps bring about that lovely post-rain smell,
known as "petrichor." Bet you didn`t know that that had a name! Well
now you do, and now I managed to write one more sentence in this AFD
on the midnight shift.

Fun facts aside, the first chances of rain arrive very late Sunday,
with the best chances just prior to sunrise on Monday. The wettest
spots, which are likely to be the Santa Cruz mountains, may see up
to 0.10" at most, with most other locations just seeing a few
hundredths of an inch. Not much, for as discussed in last night`s
AFD, this storm system just is not carrying that much moisture with
it.

All in all, it`ll be a nice break from the mundane of clear skies
and warm weather, but not a washout by any means.

.LONG TERM...
(Sunday through Friday)
Issued at 310 AM PDT Sat Sep 14 2024

In the afternoon Monday, the rain chances cease, and
things dry out a bit for a few days. High temps will be about 15
degrees below normal with highs only in the 60s for most locations.
Things begin to warm up again Tuesday with highs in the 70s for the
interior as the low pressure system moves out of the region to our
northeast.

Another low pressure system moves in Wednesday, bringing the next
chances of rain. Similar to the one previous, it does not appear to
bring much in the way of moisture, with total rainfall amounts only
in the hundredths once again.

Thursday, chances of rain end, and our continued pattern of
troughing perhaps as well. Towards the end of next week, models
point towards troughing being replaced by a ridge. This ridging is
in agreement with current CPC 8-14 day outlooks, which indicate
temperatures returning to a state of being slightly above normal, to
near normal for our region. Ensemble guidance also points to ridging
developing in the longer term. So, stay tuned, as warmer weather
isn`t quite out of season yet. The coming days will reveal just how
warm temperatures will become.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 359 AM PDT Sat Sep 14 2024

Stratus continues to push inland this morning, with terminals in the
Monterey Bay region reporting LIFR conditions. Winds are light
and variable at most terminals. At this point, not expecting
terminals outside of Monterey Bay and along the immediate
coastline to develop any CIGs. Low clouds may drift over
terminals, but not expecting CIGs to form. Winds this afternoon
will increase to become westerly and breezy. Stratus returns in
the evening.

Vicinity of SFO...Currently VFR, not expected to develop a CIG from
stratus this morning. Satellite continues to show stratus inching
closer to the terminal, though has failed to make any meaningful
push to bring CIGs to the terminal this morning. A FEW-SCT low
clouds drifting over the terminal however cannot be ruled out.
Moderate westerly winds return in the afternoon, diminishing
slightly in the evening, but remain at or around 10kts as a cold
front approaches, helping to keep winds elevated. Stratus returns
tonight bringing MVFR CIGs to the terminal.

SFO Bridge Approach...Low coastal clouds are likely to filter into
the SF Bay overnight, bringing low CIGs.

Monterey Bay Terminals...Stratus currently sits over the terminals,
causing LIFR CIGs. LIFR CIGs will last through the morning, with
visibilities expected to temporarily drop to LIFR conditions. It is
not until closer to sunrise that CIGs are expected to begin to lift,
allowing for IFR conditions to take over. In the late morning
stratus will clear to usher in VFR conditions. VFR to only last a
few hours before stratus returns in the late afternoon Saturday,
bringing MVFR CIGs initially, then lowering to become IFR into the
nighttime.

.MARINE...
(Today through Thursday)
Issued at 310 AM PDT Sat Sep 14 2024

Fresh to strong northwest winds will continue into the weekend.
Winds strengthen more Sunday afternoon to become near-gale over
the outer waters as a cold front and an unseasonably strong upper
level low pressure system arrives from the northwest, with
possibly another on its heels arriving by the middle of next week.
Increasing winds and waves will build in tandem with the incoming
upper level low.
