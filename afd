...New SYNOPSIS, SHORT TERM, LONG TERM, AVIATION, MARINE...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 337 AM PDT Thu May 18 2023

Warmer than normal conditions inland with near to below normal
temperatures along coastal areas as marine stratus continues to
bring a cooling influence. Except for some patchy drizzle near the
coast, dry weather persists through the forecast period. Slight
cooling late this week and into the weekend.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 337 AM PDT Thu May 18 2023

Second verse...same as the first. Our weather pattern the past few
days has been fairly repetitive with coastal stratus surging
inland in the night and morning hours, then clearing back to the
coastline in the afternoons. Stratus this morning is covering much
of the North Bay, the SF Peninsula, into the East Bay and Santa
Clara Valley of the South Bay. Stratus is also all around the
Monterey Bay shoreline and filling up the Salinas Valley once
more. Both the Fort Ord Profiler and Bodega Bay Profiler indicate
the marine layer is around 1000 ft deep. Some folks may experience
a bit of drizzle this morning and could encounter reduced patchy
lowered visibilities down to around 1/2 to 2 statute miles, but
conditions will improve by late morning/early afternoon.

Meanwhile we continue to have a ridging pattern over CA. That
combination of ridging and stratus will once again bring cooler
than normal highs to coastal areas impacted by the marine stratus
as inland areas not under the stratus are about 2-10 degrees above
normal. Expect today highs to be fairly similar to yesterday with
only some minor oscillations by a few degrees. There is a very
subtle cooling trend in the forecast for inland areas as that
ridge overhead gradually weakens. There`s not much in the way of
HeatRisk to worry about except in far inland localized areas under
moderate HeatRisk. That means those sensitive to heat (sick,
elderly, young kids) should stay cool and hydrated.

Look for stratus to return during the late afternoon/early
evening hours as the onshore pressure gradient increases again at
that time. That will translate to onshore winds becoming breezy
later today and advecting the stratus inland.

.LONG TERM...
(Friday through Wednesday)
Issued at 337 AM PDT Thu May 18 2023

Ridging aloft will continue to gradually weaken Friday into the
weekend which is the cause of that subtle cooling trend. By early
next week, though, the ridge strengthens slightly allowing for a
subtle warming trend. Regardless of these subtle temperature
trends...we`re not looking at any wild swings up or down on the
thermometer. You can generally plan for inland temperatures to be
in the 70s and 80s with upper 50s to low 70s along the coast. Rain
continues to be elusive in the 7 day forecast as dry conditions
persist for our CWA. An upper level low will move into the Pac NW
next week, but the precipitation won`t track southward enough to
impact our region.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 337 AM PDT Thu May 18 2023

Another night of stratus coverage below about 1,000 feet. Marine
layer depth started off slightly higher last night with some
compression seen this morning, resulting in some patchy FG. Also
seeing some very localized terrain effects this morning where
downsloping is causing some brief drying of the marine layer, thus
mixing out some of the cloud layer. Regardless, stratus should
continue to fill in and affect most terminals through sunrise this
morning and clearing during the 17-18Z hours. Another breezy onshore
flow day with moderate confidence in stratus returning a little
later tonight, but filling in by sunrise Friday.

Vicinity of SFO...IFR cigs through mid-morning as stratus continues
to fill in over the bay. Some of the aforementioned downslope drying
is noted in the current cloud field, but is expected to fill in
throughout the bay. Clearing to VFR expected by the 17Z hour with
gusty NW winds to 20 kts likely this afternoon.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay...LIFR cigs and patchy FG through sunrise as we
continue to see marine layer compression along the central coast.
The aforementioned downslope drying most notable in the wake of the
Santa Cruz Mtns is resulting in periodic clearing at KMRY. Still
expected stratus to fill in and become more continuous, but this may
limit FG development locally for a few hours more. Clearing to VFR
about 18Z with low clouds hanging around near the coastline along
the southern half of Monterey Bay through this afternoon.

.MARINE...
(Today through Tuesday)
Issued at 337 AM PDT Thu May 18 2023

Surface high pressure will gradually build over the eastern
Pacific resulting in gusty northwesterly winds across the coastal
waters  through late week and weekend. Winds will become breezy to
gusty  across the bays each afternoon and evening as well. Gusty
winds will cause increasing wind wave heights this weekend,
moderate period mixed seas will also prevail.

.MTR WATCHES/WARNINGS/ADVISORIES...
CA...None.

     evening for PZZ535-560.
