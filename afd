...New AVIATION...

.SYNOPSIS...Look for warmer weather to continue through the
weekend. Saturday looks to be the warmest day, with slight cooling
thereafter. Mild temperatures and dry conditions look to persist
through next week.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 411 AM PDT Fri May 12 2023

It`s springtime and the upper longwave pattern remains active: a
small, compact upper low sweeping through the plains,
anomalously deep upper low near the Gulf of AK, and sandwiched in
the middle is an upper level ridge. The upper level ridge began to
build over the region yesterday leading to a slight warm up. This
ridge will strengthen further today with a more marked warming
trending today and moreso over the weekend.

Quick look at the satellite fog product reveals another night of
a shallow marine layer. Surface obs and profilers put the depth
near 1,000 feet. Despite ridging aloft, onshore flow with marine
stratus to start the day will limit over all warming potential.
Highs today will be in the 60s and 70s near the coast/bays with
lower 80s for the warmer inland valleys.

.LONG TERM...
(Saturday through Thursday)
Issued at 411 AM PDT Fri May 12 2023

Upper level ridging will really kick in over the weekend bringing
well above normal temperatures to the region and possibly some of
the hottest temperatures of 2023 so far. A few coastal clouds to
start the day Saturday before quickly dissipating and eroding
back to the coast. Expect mostly sunny skies by Saturday
afternoon. Ample sunshine coupled with 850mb temperatures in the
upper teens(C) will yield well above normal temperatures (5-10
deg above normal at the coast and 10-20 deg above normal inland).
Current forecast has upper 60s to near 80 coast/bays with 80s to
lower 90s inland. Moderate to high confidence for temps >90 deg
will be interior North Bay/East Bay/Monterey - San Benito areas.
How about >95? Low confidence that a few spots far interior North
bay could actually exceed 95 degrees. Heat in May isn`t that
uncommon so record temperatures are not expected per se. However,
even without records persons with outdoor plans should still use
caution. Additionally, stay hydrated, take breaks, never leave
people or pets in vehicles.

Very subtle cooling expected on Sunday with temperatures dropping
2-4 degrees. Still a pleasant day for outdoor activities, but
interior valleys will still experience Moderate Heat Risk
concerns so caution should be used again.

More widespread cooling is expected on Monday and beyond, but
temperatures still remain above seasonal averages next week.

Lastly, current forecast still remains dry for next week. We`ll
continue to monitor some upper level moisture sneaking into
California from the Desert SW, but its impacts locally at this
time appear to be mainly clouds.

The most impact for the long term will be focused around heat
concerns.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 530 AM PDT Fri May 12 2023

Current MVFR-IFR conditions expected to last until the mid to late
morning hours, between 16 and 18Z, for most terminals until stratus
begins to mix out. VFR conditions expected for the afternoon and
evening of Friday, before hints at a return of coastal stratus in
the early morning hours of Saturday. However, not expecting coastal
stratus coverage Friday night into Saturday morning to be as robust
as seen this morning, as high pressure and subsidence may lead to a
more compressed marine layer. Confidence is low, so at this time,
have at least included MVFR cigs in the TAF for the early morning
hours of Saturday. Winds expected to become onshore and breezy this
afternoon before decreasing again into the late evening.

Vicinity of SFO...Currently MVFR, expected to become IFR near 13Z as
coastal stratus continues to advect into the SF Bay. Beyond 15Z,
CIGs look to become MVFR again, lasting until around 17Z, afterwards
clearing to VFR as stratus mixes out. Winds increase to become
moderate around 18 knots and gusting near 23 knots in the late
afternoon.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...MVFR, becoming VFR around 19Z. Expecting
scattered low clouds to remain through much of the day, but
conditions look to remain VFR through the late evening before MVFR
CIGs return. Westerly to northwesterly winds pick up to around 8-12
knots in the afternoon before decreasing into the night.

.MARINE...
(Today through Thursday)
Issued at 323 AM PDT Fri May 12 2023

Moderate to fresh wind of the north prevails through Saturday
evening, with bays increasing to become breezy in the afternoons.
Winds look to lighten and diminish into Sunday. Light northerly
swell continues, alongside longer period southerly swell.
Southerly swell in the waters over the next several days will
create a shoaling hazard over near shore shoals.

.MTR WATCHES/WARNINGS/ADVISORIES...
CA...None.
PZ...Small Craft Advisory from 9 AM this morning to 9 PM PDT this
     evening for PZZ535-560.
