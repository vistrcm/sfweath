...New UPDATE, MARINE...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 156 AM PDT Thu Sep 5 2024

Hot and dry conditions will continue through Friday resulting in
widespread moderate to locally major HeatRisk and near critical fire
weather conditions. A pronounced cooling trend kicks off Saturday
and continues into next week.

.UPDATE...
Issued at 912 AM PDT Thu Sep 5 2024

Stratus has developed in the Sonoma County Valleys, the southern
San Francisco Bay, and the Monterey bay region earlier this
morning, but the stratus decks have begun mixing out and any
remaining inland stratus should clear out in the next hour.
Forecast for hot and dry conditions inland is still on track. The
operations team considered issuing fire weather products for the
Santa Lucias and Santa Cruz Mountains, but after coordination with
neighboring offices, we`ve decided to hold off as the diurnally
driven winds will not last long enough to reach critical fire
weather criteria. Nevertheless, we are still anticipating near
critical fire weather conditions across the interior through
Friday.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 156 AM PDT Thu Sep 5 2024

Temperatures are running near to slightly cooler and relative
humidities are running near to slightly wetter than this time 24
hours ago with the exception of higher elevations. High pressure
will continue to be the dominant feature today with widespread
moderate to locally major HeatRisk and maximum temperatures 10-20
degrees above normal. Near critical fire weather conditions will
continue due to poor relative humidity recoveries across interior
locations and higher elevations. Across higher elevations, light
northerly/offshore flow will continue through the morning with a
return to onshore flow by this afternoon.

High pressure and subsequent subsidence aloft supports a
compressed/shallow marine layer with reduced visibility, patchy fog,
and coastal drizzle so be sure to slow down, allow extra time to
reach your destination, and use your low-beams as these conditions
are already being observed this morning.

The Boone Fire in western Fresno County is butting up against both
Monterey and San Benito Counties so expect to see more concentrated
haze/smoke in the immediate vicinity and more diffuse haze/smoke
skirting across the area.

.LONG TERM...
(Friday through Wednesday)
Issued at 156 AM PDT Thu Sep 5 2024

The forecast has continued to delay the cool down with tomorrow
forecast to be very similar to today; therefore, the Heat Advisory
has been extended through 8 PM Friday. Near critical fire weather
conditions will also continue through Friday across interior
locations and higher elevations.

An upper-level shortwave will swing through Friday posing a low
chance/high impact scenario due to hot and dry antecedent
conditions. At this time, chances for thunderstorms are non-zero
with the greatest chances (10-20%) in the Sierra. If a thunderstorm
were to develop in our area, it would be high-based convection with
the primary threats being dry lightning and gusty outflows. The
atmosphere in our area just does not look to stack up in terms of
instability and moisture coinciding at the same time and place.

Upper-level troughing will begin to develop off the West Coast
Saturday further digging into next week. This will bring a
noticeable cooldown and the return of onshore flow which will result
in moderate to excellent humidity recoveries and gusty conditions
through gaps and passes. Uncertainty grows towards the end of the
forecast period as guidance/models diverge on location and timing of
a low pressure system that could bring rain chances to the North Bay.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 434 AM PDT Thu Sep 5 2024

IFR/LIFR conditions continue across the Monterey Bay area and are
expected to continue through at least mid-morning, with the low
stratus retreating back to the coastline by midday.

Vicinity of SFO...VFR conditions are expected to persist through
much of the forecast period, with moderate confidence that low
stratus ceilings will develop after midnight later tonight.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO

Monterey Bay Terminals...IFR/LIFR ceilings/fog/drizzle will
persist through at least mid-morning today, with areas of fog
limiting visibility down to 1/4mi at times. Ceilings and fog
should lift and/or retreat to the coastline by late morning
leaving VFR conditions until IFR/LIFR conditions develop once
again later tonight.

&&

.MARINE...
(Today through Tuesday)
Issued at 912 AM PDT Thu Sep 5 2024

High pressure continues to dominate the pattern, with gentle to
moderate winds and slight to moderate seas through the weekend.
Stronger NW winds and rough seas will return by the middle of
next week.

&&

.FIRE WEATHER...
Issued at 930 PM PDT Wed Sep 4 2024

The marine layer is approx 1000 feet deep this evening with some
compression forecast in the marine layer depth Thursday. It`ll
remain warm/hot and dry within the lower level temperature
inversion with little change in the strength of the mid to upper
level high pressure system tonight and Thursday. A mainly weak
500 mb trough moves in Friday along with thermal ridging embedded
within the trough at 700 mb and somewhat also at 500 mb which should
sustain air mass stability and preclude convection.

.MTR WATCHES/WARNINGS/ADVISORIES...

     512>518.
