.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 1227 AM PDT Sat Apr 6 2024

Dry weather has returned. Clear skies overnight will lead to cold
mornings and patchy fog this weekend. A steady warming trend
kicks off next week.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 1227 AM PDT Sat Apr 6 2024

The rain has ended, winds have calmed, and skies have cleared
overnight. The cold mid-level air remains in place and radiational
cooling has taken advantage of the clear skies and low dew points to
cool efficiently so far tonight. Patchy fog and frost are
expected later this morning as the nocturnal cooling continues.
Most inland areas are expected to drop into the mid 30s over the
next several hours.

After the sun comes up, the temperature will increase quickly
under sunny skies. However, the influence of cold air aloft and
moderate northerly winds will keep the afternoon temperatures
mostly in the upper 50s.

.LONG TERM...
(Sunday through Friday)
Issued at 1227 AM PDT Sat Apr 6 2024

Clear skies and cool temperatures will continue Sunday. There is
still a hint of very light precipitation potential on Sunday, but
the ensemble guidance agrees that if anything reaches the ground
it will be measured in hundredths.

By Monday, a distinct warming trend kicks off as the deep trough
gives way to a persistent ridge. This will bring dry weather, mostly
clear skies, warm afternoons, and gentle winds through the week.
As surprising as it sounds given the current cold temperatures,
late week will be quite warm. In fact, San Jose is expected to
exceed the 80 degree mark from Wed-Fri, which hasn`t happened
since November. Essentially we are going from roughly 10 degrees
below normal today, to 10+ degrees above normal later this week.
It`s not out of the question for a heat advisory to be considered
as we get closer to the Wed-Fri peak.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 434 AM PDT Sat Apr 6 2024

VFR through the early afternoon today before a weak frontal system
moves through this evening. Expecting cigs right around the MVFR
mark as the front moves through early evening. Behind the front,
clouds thin but SCT-BKN remain into Sunday morning. Mostly dry
with FROPA, though hi-res guidance does hint at some showers
offshore. Confidence to include VCSH in TAFs was low, so will need
to monitor. Otherwise winds W/NW 10-15 kts this afternoon.

Vicinity of SFO...Typical breezy NW winds this afternoon and VFR
prevailing into late afternoon. Refer to above statement regarding
FROPA and showers. Confidence low in cigs lingering after FROPA
overnight into Sunday morning, so kept SCT in TAF for now.

SFO Approach Bridge...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...SCT-BKN cloud cover over high terrain
this morning. Expected to mostly clear and remain VFR into the
afternoon. Weak FROPA expected this evening with MVFR cigs.
Clouds thin out into Sunday morning.

.MARINE...
(Today through Thursday)
Issued at 434 AM PDT Sat Apr 6 2024

Quiet conditions persist over the waters into the weekend. A new,
weak upper low exiting the Pacific Northwest will bring a period
of strong northwest breezes to near gale over the waters beginning
Sunday afternoon into Monday. Conditions remain dry through next
week. A series of light to moderate northwest swell trains
continue through the forecast period.
