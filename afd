...New UPDATE...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 1247 AM PDT Mon Mar 25 2024

Quiet weather for today and Tuesday. An unsettled pattern returns
for mid week into the weekend with renewed rain chances.

&&

.UPDATE...
Issued at 922 AM PDT Mon Mar 25 2024

Lingering low level moisture from yesterday`s trough has led to
patchy drizzle/light rain this morning. If one would look at KMUX
radar you woulnd`t know about the precip, but spotter reports and
automated rain gages show a few bucket tips the last few hours.
That being said, do expect gradual drying through out the morning
as drier northwest flow over the region continues. Morning KOAK
sounding also shows a pocket of upper level moisture, which will
promote occasional mid-high level clouds as well.

All in all, a much more quiet day than the weather experienced
over the weekend.

No update needed.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 1247 AM PDT Mon Mar 25 2024

A northwest flow pattern will prevail aloft as high pressure
advances towards the area from the northeast Pacific. Breezy winds
early this morning will gradually subside today as the pressure
gradient relaxes. Several patches of stratus/stratocumulus clouds
are evident on satellite imagery early this morning and expect some
erosion to scattered stratocumulus/cumulus to take place today once
daytime mixing ensues. High temperatures will warm by a few degrees
compared to yesterday with 60s for the inland valleys and upper 50s
along the immediate coast and bays. Lows tonight will be mostly in
the 40s.

&&

.LONG TERM...
(Tuesday through Sunday)
Issued at 1247 AM PDT Mon Mar 25 2024

Quiet weather and dry conditions will prevail on Tuesday with high
pressure in control.

Unsettled conditions return for Wednesday into Thursday. Rain
showers are initially expected along and ahead of a cold front on
Wednesday, with a continuation into Thursday in an unstable post-
frontal regime. Amounts appear beneficial and not overly impactful.

Deterministic models and their ensembles are in good agreement in a
stronger low pressure system moving through the region on Friday
into the weekend. There remains some disagreement on the exact
evolution of the pattern and resulting placement of the best rain
totals, but overall there remains at least medium confidence (~40%)
for seeing 1-2" in the coastal mountains and 0.25-0.75" elsewhere.
Stay tuned as we fine tune the forecast details in the days ahead.
