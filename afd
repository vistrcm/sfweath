...New AVIATION, MARINE...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 133 AM PST Tue Dec 19 2023

Rain showers continue with wet weather likely to prevail through
midweek. Drying trend by late week that will continue into early
next week.

&&

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 133 AM PST Tue Dec 19 2023

Light-to-moderate rain showers continue to move across the region
early this morning. Rainfall rates generally remain low at
generally less than 0.20" per hour, locally up to 0.40" in the
coastal ranges of the North Bay. Lingering rain showers will
persist throughout the day on Tuesday with a slight chance of
thunderstorms as well.

Tonight, an upper-level low will drop southward out of the Gulf
of Alaska and becomes a cut-off low. As such, another wave of
light-to- moderate (locally heavy at times) precipitation will
move ashore by Wednesday morning. Thus, allow yourself extra time
to reach your destination for the Wednesday morning commute.

&&

.LONG TERM...
(Wednesday through Monday)
Issued at 133 AM PST Tue Dec 19 2023

Instability increase enough to support a slight chance of
thunderstorms as well. During the 24 hour period from Tuesday
night to Wednesday night, nearly all coastal locations have a high
chance (90-100%) of seeing at least an inch, while coastal ranges
of the North Bay, the Santa Cruz Mtns, and the Big Sur coast have
a moderate-to-high chance (80-90%) of seeing at least 2 inches.

By late Wednesday, most of the precipitation should be coming to
an end as the cut-off low drifts southward and becomes placed off
of the southern California coast. The exception will be over the
Central Coast where rain may linger into Thursday morning.

Temperatures return to near seasonal averages for late week and
into the upcoming weekend as high pressure builds overhead. A
drying trend also returns into early next week with the
possibility for our next rain-maker arriving by the middle of next
week.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 352 AM PST Tue Dec 19 2023

Rain showers and MVFR-IFR conditions continue this morning.
Surface low off the Oregon coast and associated frontal boundary
will weaken this morning, bringing a lull in shower activity this
afternoon but VCSH still possible for most terminals. Another
surface low will drop down to the CA coast this evening, which
will bring more widespread, potentially heavier rainfall later
tonight across most terminals. MVFR conditions likely with
localized IFR visbys possible in moments of heavier rainfall
overnight. Chance for thunderstorms also exists this evening into
Wed morning, but confidence lower at this point to include VCTS
in the TAFs, but stay tuned for updates. As the new low pressure
approaches, winds will shift SW late morning then become SE and
gusty as center of low approaches this evening into the overnight.
Rain chances diminish by late Wednesday.

Vicinity of SFO...Rain showers and MVFR cigs persist through the
morning. Moderate S/SW winds also continue through the afternoon
today. Southerly winds expected to increase this afternoon and
shift SE as center of surface low approaches the SF peninsula
coast overnight. As this low approaches, widespread rain,
potentially heavier at times resulting in reduced visbys, will
move through the Bay Area late tonight through early morning
Wednesday.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...VFR currently with potential for
intermittent MVFR conditions and -SHRA from 13z to 17z this
morning. VCSH and SW winds expected this afternoon. Increasing SE
winds expected this evening. Higher chances for rain and MVFR
conditions after 10z tonight.


&&

.MARINE...
(Today through Sunday)
Issued at 352 AM PST Tue Dec 19 2023

Southerly winds are diminishing with lingering showers early this
morning. Another area of low pressure will approach the coastal
waters this afternoon, moving south parallel to the California
coastline through Thursday. This will bring another round of
potentially heavier rain, isolated thunderstorms, and gusty
southerly winds on Wednesday. Elevated seas are expected again as
a new northwest swell builds tonight into Wednesday. Dry weather
and northerly winds return by the end of the week.
