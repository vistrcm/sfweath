...New UPDATE, MARINE...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 1255 PM PDT Sat May 18 2024

Typical summer-like pattern to persist through the weekend with
gradual warming trend for the first half of the upcoming week.
Nighttime low clouds will spread inland and then retreat back to the
coast by mid-to-late morning each day.

&&

.UPDATE...
Issued at 848 AM PDT Sun May 19 2024

Sky conditions are already improving over the North Bay at this hour
and will soon clear over the Central Coast by mid-to-late morning.
The HRRR has clouds dissipating even out over the ocean by late
afternoon. As such, expecting slightly warmer temperatures today
with afternoon highs in the mid 70`s to lower 80`s across the
interior with upper 50`s to near 70 degrees at the coast. No updates
are anticipated at this time.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 301 AM PDT Sun May 19 2024

Tonight`s stratus coverage is not as extensive as previous nights
with patchier stratus inland and more widespread stratus along the
coastline. Stratus is expected to clear out by mid-morning
throughout the Bay Area. Confidence in the timing of stratus
dissipation along the Central Coast is a little lower with, as
discussed in the previous AFD, models are not handling the current
setup well. The most likely scenario is stratus will briefly break
up during the afternoon along the coast before overcast conditions
return by the late evening. Slight upper level troughing and gusty
conditions over the coastal waters will keep the marine layer more
mixed and keep stratus confined closer to the coast.

Inland temperatures today will be fairly seasonal while temperatures
along the coast will be seasonal to slightly below average due to
stratus coverage limiting surface warming. Inland highs will reach
the upper 70s to low 80s while coastal highs stay in the upper 50s
to low 60s. Some potential (generally 5-10% chance) for coastal
drizzle tonight from Santa Cruz to the Big Sur coastline but minimal
to no accumulation is expected.

.LONG TERM...
(Monday through Saturday)
Issued at 301 AM PDT Sun May 19 2024

A slight warming trend is expected through mid-week with
temperatures building into the upper 70s to mid 80s by
Tuesday/Wednesday. Inland stratus coverage is expected to be less
impressive this week as a deeper marine layer and gusty offshore
winds keep the atmosphere well mixed and low clouds confined to the
coast. Ensemble guidance agrees that Tuesday is looking to be the
warmest day this week with the highest probability of widespread
temperatures greater than 80 degrees. Minor heat risk begins to
spread through most of the Bay Area and portions of the Salinas
Valley Monday through Thursday. People who are incredibly sensitive
to heat should take precautions while outdoors and remember to drink
plenty of water.

By late week, upper level troughing strengthens and moves farther
south into California with an associated surface low passing through
the state. This will bring about a pattern change with widespread
below average temperatures expected. By the weekend, inland highs
will be in the upper 60s to mid 70s with coastal highs in the upper
50s to low 60s. CPC temperature outlooks have temperatures leaning
below average through the end of May and into the beginning of June.
Ensemble guidance suggests this system will be fairly dry for our
region with any precipitation associated with it directed northwards
of us into far northern California/southern Oregon.

Sunday afternoon that last into the night. Coastal cloud cover moves
slightly inland Sunday evening, affecting SNS and MRY.

Vicinity of SFO...VFR through the TAF period. Expect light to
moderate winds overnight with gusty westerly winds building into the
afternoon. Wind gusts will reduce into Sunday night, and become
moderate for the late night.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...MVFR/IFR CIGs last through early Sunday
afternoon with some moments of drizzle. CIGS recede back to the
immediate coast into the afternoon, leading to VFR at the TAF sites.
Winds stay light to moderate through the TAF Period. MVFR and IFR
CIGs return early Sunday night.

.MARINE...
(Today through Friday)
Issued at 848 AM PDT Sun May 19 2024

Strong northerly winds continue, with gale force gusts expected
