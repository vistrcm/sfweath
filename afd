...New SYNOPSIS, SHORT TERM, LONG TERM, AVIATION, MARINE...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 246 AM PST Mon Nov 20 2023

Gusty winds on higher elevations last into the mid morning before
reducing. Calmer and dryer weather lasts through the rest of the
forecast. Temperatures warm in the mid week.

&&

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 246 AM PST Mon Nov 20 2023


The night shift has been keeping an eye on winds as higher peaks
continue to see increased Northerly winds. St Helena recorded an 81
mph gust with Mt Diablo not far behind with a 68 mph gust. The Wind
Advisory is in effect for higher elevations around the Bay Area and
will last into the mid morning, which is when these winds look to
subside. Luckily the night crew isn`t seeing these stronger winds
mix into lower and more populated areas.

The rest of Monday ushers in a trend of warming and drying
conditions with fairly calm weather expected through the week as back
to back ridges dominate the weather pattern.

.LONG TERM...
(Tuesday through Sunday)
Issued at 246 AM PST Mon Nov 20 2023


As per my previous paragraph, the back to back ridges make the
forecast fairly uncomplicated for the week. Temperatures warm in the
mid week but back off into the late week with a brief trough between
ridges. The is the potential for increased northerly winds ahead of
the second trough, but the orientation of the axis isn`t quite there
to repeat tonight`s winds.

In the very long term, models and ensemble branch off quite a bit
(with quite an interesting trough progression in the ECMWF), but
still offer dry conditions for the end of the month.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 246 AM PST Mon Nov 20 2023

VFR throughout the region and TAF period. Strong north to northeast
winds aloft continue to cause LLWS concerns across the region,
most evidently in the North and East Bay terminals. Winds aloft
will weaken, and LLWS concerns diminish along with them, through
the morning. Winds will flow in an offshore pattern, with
relatively moderate breezes around 8-12 knots during the afternoon
before becoming light overnight.

Vicinity of SFO...VFR through the TAF period. Breezy north to
northeast flow through the afternoon, becoming light overnight.
Marginal LLWS concerns continue through the end of the morning,
although wind speeds aloft are expected to decrease.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...VFR through the TAF period. Light drainage
flow continues through the morning, followed by light northwest to
northerly flow through the end of the TAF period.

&&

.MARINE...
(Today through Saturday)
Issued at 246 AM PST Mon Nov 20 2023

Breezy north winds will continue to diminish through the morning,
leading to moderate winds for most of the week. Expect a building
northwest swell during the middle of the week. Another system
will approach Thanksgiving day and Friday, causing deteriorating
conditions for the coastal waters.
