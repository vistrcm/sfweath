...New UPDATE...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 1208 AM PST Thu Mar 6 2025

Scattered showers and a slight chance of thunderstorms continue into
the afternoon before diminishing by the evening hours. Dry
conditions and a slight warming trend return for the upcoming
weekend, before unsettled weather returns next week.

.UPDATE...
Issued at 821 AM PST Thu Mar 6 2025

Isolated to scattered rain showers persist this morning, mainly from
the San Francisco International Airport and points southward. There
remains a potential for thunderstorms (10-20%) this afternoon with
daytime heating and MUCAPE values approaching 250 J/kg, especially
across the Central Coast and later this afternoon across the North
Bay. However, precipitation should be ending by late afternoon so
less confident for thunderstorm development over the North Bay. Rain
showers and/or thunderstorms will gradually diminish by this
evening. No updates are anticipated this morning as the forecast
remains on track.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 1208 AM PST Thu Mar 6 2025

Scattered showers have developed across the Bay Area and Central
Coast behind the cold front that brought a colder and more unstable
airmass to the region, helping to enhance convective activity across
the area, in particular the oceans, where the relatively warm
waters provide more instability overnight than the cooling land.
These scattered showers continue through the rest of the morning,
as a new occluded front develops over the Bay Area and provides a
trigger for continued convective activity. A slight chance (10-20%
probability) for thunderstorms persists into the afternoon hours,
with the greatest potential over the Central Coast. Any
thunderstorms that develop will have the potential for small hail
and locally heavy downpours. In addition, with the cold airmass
over the region, snow is possible across the highest peaks,
especially across the Central Coast, as snow levels reach as low
as 3000 feet. Rain coverage will begin to diminish in the
afternoon hours, more so in the evening.

The morning lows will be chilly in the inland valleys, where
temperatures reach the middle to upper 30s, while lows in the lower
to middle 40s are expected in the coastal regions. Today`s highs
reach the middle 50s to lower 60s in the lower elevations, with
highs in the 40s to the upper 30s expected in the higher elevations.
At the ridgelines and immediate coast, wind gusts up to 30 miles per
hour continue through the evening hours today.

.LONG TERM...
(Friday through Wednesday)
Issued at 1208 AM PST Thu Mar 6 2025

Dry and warmer conditions will set in for Friday and the upcoming
weekend as an upper level ridge passes through the region. High
temperatures on Saturday and Sunday will lie around the seasonal
average, with highs in the middle to upper 60s in the inland valleys
and the upper 50s to the lower 60s in the coastal regions. Lows will
remain quite chilly, especially on Friday morning, when the impacts
of the recent rainfall and cold air mass will cause inland lows to
drop a few degrees with southern Monterey County seeing lows in the
upper 20s to lower 30s. Otherwise, weekend lows will remain similar
to the expected lows this morning.

The succession of rain systems resumes late Sunday and early Monday
with periods of light to moderate rain expected through the end of
the forecast period. Ensemble model means are already highlighting a
system towards the middle of the upcoming week as a potentially
impactful event. A closer analysis of the ensemble model clusters
suggests that the magnitude of the impacts will depend on how the
system interacts with a ridge over the Intermountain West. Check
back with us over the next week as the details come into better
focus.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 323 AM PST Thu Mar 6 2025

VFR-MVFR conditions prevail across the region as scattered showers
continue through the morning at HAF, SJC, and points south. Slight
chance of convective showers (10-20% probability) continues across
the Central Coast into the afternoon, with small hail and visibility
reductions possible within the strongest storms. Otherwise, breezy
and gusty northwest winds continue through the evening hours. Winds
become light overnight with stratus development expected in the
Monterey Bay terminals, with lesser confidence for stratus in the
Bay Area.

Vicinity of SFO...Low confidence for convective showers near the
terminal area this morning. If convection does form over the
terminal, expect a brief period of reduced visibilities and
gustier winds. Otherwise, VFR-MVFR conditions and breezy and gusty
west- northwest winds continue into the evening hours. Chances
for MVFR ceilings decrease starting in the afternoon. Winds
diminish overnight with low confidence for stratus at the
terminal.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...Scattered showers and a slight chance
for convection continue into the afternoon. Breezy and gusty winds
persist with enhanced gusts in areas where convective storms
develop, with the winds diminishing this evening into the
overnight hours. VFR-MVFR conditions through the evening, when
confidence in IFR-MVFR stratus impacts has increased.

.MARINE...
(Today through Tuesday)
Issued at 323 AM PST Thu Mar 6 2025

Scattered showers will continue this morning, with a slight to
moderate chance for thunderstorms and associated strong gusts over
the waters south of Pt. Reyes. Otherwise, strong northwest breezes
and rough seas prevail through the evening. The winds will
gradually diminish to a a gentle breeze Saturday, allowing seas to
subside through the weekend. Conditions will deteriorate again
next week as a series of storms moves through the coastal waters.
