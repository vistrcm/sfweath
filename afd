.SHORT TERM...
Issued at 1249 AM PDT Mon Oct 20 2025
(Today and tonight)

Another quiet fall day is on tap, with the main forecast highlight
being another round of offshore winds developing tonight and
continuing into Monday. Observations already show north to east
winds over the North Bay region, while areas south have onshore
flow. Expect offshore winds to continue to materialize overnight and
linger into Monday. These winds will also usher in drier air to the
region, which should keep much of the area stays free. The exception
might be around Monterey Bay, as an otter eddy formed earlier in the
evening and circulated some log clouds around it.  Stratus may
continue to do this dance overnight, teasing coastal Monterey County
and the northern Salinas Valley with low clouds and patchy fog
through the morning. Once the sun comes out, skies should clear and
high temperatures will be beautiful, with 70s near the coast and 80s
inland.

Monday night into Tuesday, a southerly surge of stratus returns and
creeps up the coast. Expect the marine layer to be around 500 feet
bringing cool, cloudy, and foggy conditions for coastal
communities.

.LONG TERM...
Issued at 1249 AM PDT Mon Oct 20 2025
(Tuesday through Sunday)

The extended forecast continues to remain interesting as models and
ensembles show a cut off low that has been meandering off the coast
of southern CA moving slightly to the north and then inland. One
thing we know for certain with this system is that cooler
temperatures will be ushered into the region, and the marine layer
should deepen to around 1200 feet or so. Stratus should form along
the coast and perhaps seep into some interior valleys. Where
uncertainty lies with this system is the threat for thunderstorms.
Deterministic guidance and some ensembles show the chance for
isolated thunderstorm activity starting late Tuesday evening across
portions of the Central Coast into Wednesday. As daytime heating
allows, some guidance adds the threat of isolated thunderstorms
along the higher areas of terrain for the East and South Bay
counties. A fair amount of convective ingredients are available, mid
level lapse rates around 7-7.5C/km, a couple hundred J/kg of MUCAPE,
PWATs near 0.80", and lift from the low. The limiting factor seems
to be shear at this point. For now, no mention of thunderstorms have
been added into the forecast. Chances look to be around 14% or less,
but that could change as we get more into CAM territory.
Thankfully we have had some decent rain in the past, so fire weather
concerns are low.

After a cool Wednesday, we will see an uptick in high temperatures
as weak ridging noses into the region on Thursday. An area of low
pressure off the Gulf of Alaska will deepen, allowing for upper
level troughing and zonal flow to take over. At this time it looks
like beneficial rain appears to be the most likely solution as
ensembles continue to trend towards lower amounts Friday - Sunday.
Right rainfall amounts look like this: North Bay counties may see
around 0.50-1.25", East Bay counties, Santa Cruz County, and the San
Francisco Peninsula around 0.15-0.50", Santa Clara 0.10-0.40", and
finally Monterey and San Benitio counties 0-0.15". These amounts
will likely change, so stay tuned to the forecast.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 410 AM PDT Mon Oct 20 2025

Generally VFR throughout the region, excepting LIFR stratus and fog
developing in the Monterey Bay and Salinas Valleys, along with
shallow fog at STS. Confidence for stratus at HAF has decreased as
the offshore flow on the nearby ridgelines might keep the terminal
clear. Speaking of offshore flow, while the gradients are too low to
mention LLWS in the TAFs, stronger winds aloft might make for bumpy
takeoffs and landings through the morning hours. Stratus should mix
out by the late morning hours with a gentle onshore breeze at the
coastal terminals during the afternoon and evening. Otherwise, light
winds continue through the day. This evening, offshore winds develop
across the interior with light winds at the coastal region, with
some stratus in the Monterey Bay region.

Vicinity of SFO... High confidence of VFR through the TAF period. A
gentle west-northwest breeze in the afternoon and evening, otherwise
winds remain light.

SFO Bridge Approach... Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals... Models have struggled to capture the LIFR
stratus and fog that has developed across the region and down the
Salinas Valley. Currently expecting the stratus to stick around
through the late morning hours, with breezy onshore winds in the
afternoon. Stratus returns to the terminals tonight as the winds
become light, with moderate confidence on timing.

.MARINE...
(Today through Saturday)
Issued at 410 AM PDT Mon Oct 20 2025

Northwest swell combined with fresh to strong northwest breezes
are causing very rough seas. The winds will steadily decrease
from Monday into Tuesday, allowing the seas to gradually subside
before a new long period northwest swell arrives early Tuesday
night and again on Thursday night.

&&

.BEACHES...
Issued at 1249 AM PDT Mon Oct 20 2025

A Beach Hazards Statement is in effect runs through 8PM Monday
evening as a long- period swell impacts the Pacific coast. Never
turn your back to the ocean! Swim near a lifeguard if possible! If
caught in a rip current, swim parallel to shore until you escape
its influence.

Additional beach hazards lurk in the forecast beyond Monday, when
another long period swell arrives. This may lead to another Beach
Hazards Statement or a High Surf Advisory possible depending on
how the forecast evolves.
