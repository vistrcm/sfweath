...New AVIATION...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 1246 PM PDT Sun Aug 18 2024

Temperatures at or slightly below seasonal averages continue through
the next week, along with breezy onshore flow and early morning
stratus. A passing disturbance to the north will result in a few
isolated showers north of the Golden Gate Friday.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 1218 AM PDT Mon Aug 19 2024

Patchy stratus is developing along the coast and in the Berkeley-San
Leandro Hills, expected to steadily expand through the night. The
upper level pattern continues to evoke a weak Omega Block pattern,
with a low off the Pacific Northwest, a trough centered over the
Eastern Great lakes and into the state of Georgia, and a high
sandwiched between the two over the southern Plains. Therefore, not
expecting a really big change in the weather today. Perhaps a slight
warming trend inland with highs in the 80s in the inland valleys, up
to the mid 90s in the warmest spots, the upper 60s to the mid 70s in
the Bayshore, and the upper 50s to mid 60s along the coast. Breezy
winds will set up in the afternoon and evening with gusts up to 20-
30 miles per hour across the gaps and passes.

.LONG TERM...
Issued at 135 PM PDT Sun Aug 18 2024
(Monday night through next Saturday)

The ridge portion of the quasi-Omega block nudges westward on
Tuesday leading to a additional few degrees of warming. The
building 500 mb heights will help to compress the marine layer a
little. Warmest inland locations will soar into the upper 80s/90s
with far S interior locations making a run for 100 degrees
(40-60% chc).

The flexing upper ridge quickly retreats eastward Wednesday as an
embedded shortwave trough rounds the base of the PacNW upper low.
Temps will begin to trend cooler as the marine layer redevelops.
Had added some light drizzle back to the forecast for Wednesday
night into Thursday.  Coastal fog will also be an issue again.

The second half of the week into next weekend becomes more active
as the upstream upper low final gets kicked. Decent agreement
among ensembles and cluster analysis (minor diff on timing/depth)
with an upper low dropping into CA late Thursday and Friday.
Deterministic agreement is a different story with a wide variety
of outcomes. Following the ensemble approach temperatures cool
further Thursday and moreso Friday. EFI shows below seasonal
averages through the period as well. The wrinkle in the forecast
will be precip. Latest guidance does bring some scattered showers
into the North Bay Friday, but nothing south of the Golden Gate.
While there is some instability, think best chance for actual
thunder will be north of the forecast area. Therefore, will keep
with a low chc (15-20%) for showers. Not expecting much in the
way of accumulation.

Drier weather returns next weekend with a warming trend.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 412 AM PDT Mon Aug 19 2024

Dry air mixing down into the marine layer has resulted in less
marine layer stratus developing than expected. Early look at 12z
balloon launch from KOAK depicts 10-15C dew point depressions in
the lowest portion of the atmosphere.

Vicinity of SFO...A small area of low level stratus has persisted
in the vicinity of KSFO and KOAK but has struggled to become more
widespread due to drier air aloft mixing toward the surface. VFR
is expected to prevail at KSFO with MVFR ceilings at KOAK between
17-18z, but may happen sooner than that. Gusty onshore flow will
develop again this afternoon.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...Drier than expected air aloft has
maintained mostly clear skies through the overnight with VFR
conditions likely to continue through most of the day, as surface
high pressure settles over the area.

.MARINE...
(Today through Saturday)
Issued at 1218 AM PDT Mon Aug 19 2024

Surface high pressure over the offshore waters will result in
northwest winds this week. An upper level low pressure system from
Alaska will dig southward reaching the Pacific Northwest and far
northern California late this week.

.MTR WATCHES/WARNINGS/ADVISORIES...
CA...None.
PZ...Small Craft Advisory from 3 PM this afternoon to 3 AM PDT
     Tuesday for Pt Pinos to Pt Piedras Blancas 0-10 nm.

     Small Craft Advisory from 9 AM Tuesday to 3 AM PDT Wednesday for
