...New AVIATION...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 313 AM PDT Sat Sep 16 2023

A gradual cooling trend will continue this weekend and next week.
Low clouds and fog lingering along the immediate coast, helping to
moderate temperatures there. Coastal drizzle developing during the
late night and early morning hours.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 317 AM PDT Sat Sep 16 2023

A 575 decameter 500 mb geopotential height low is located approx 400
miles west of the Bay Area and north Central Coast. The low is
forecast to remain nearly stationary today and tonight due to
opposing directional winds encompassing both sides of the low;
northeast polar jet stream winds developing to the north, southwest
subtropical jet stream winds to the south. A lower level cool
frontal boundary associated with the low over the outer CA waters
will advance eastward ushering in a net cooling across our forecast
area today (and through the weekend) and this will further deepen
the marine layer, usher inland more night & morning stratus with
patchy drizzle forming due to onshore winds & upslope cooling along
the coast. Daytime highs today 60s at the coast, a mix of mid to
upper 60s and 70s bayside, to the lower to mid 80s farther inland.
Lows tonight in the upper 50s to near 60s coastside and bayside, 50s
inland with a few upper 40s farther inland valleys.

.LONG TERM...
(Sunday through Friday)
Issued at 317 AM PDT Sat Sep 16 2023

There are some differences in handling of the aforementioned 500 mb
low to our west, southwest and eventually south Monday through
Wednesday next week. Otherwise there`s relatively good global model
agreement regarding location and strength of the eastern Pacific 500
mb ridge and downstream 500 mb trough across the western states through
Wednesday (120 hours). Long wave troughing anchors in since the eastern
Pacific 500 mb ridge becomes unstable, imbalanced polar jet stream
winds will move southward maintaining 500 mb troughing over the west,
merging with the aforementioned 500 mb low eventually to our south.
Onshore winds will keep cooler than mid September normal temperatures
ongoing through the week. Daytime highs similar to this weekend with
60s at the coast, a mix of mid to upper 60s and 70s bayside, to the
lower 80s farther inland. Lows mainly in the 50s with a few upper 40s
farther inland valleys.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 422 AM PDT Sat Sep 16 2023

Extensive inland stratus coverage persists through the late morning,
save the coastal areas where ceilings will lift to MVFR but not
clear out. Breezy northwest winds will develop in the afternoon,
with wind speeds up to 10-15 knots at the terminals. Stratus starts
to develop again in the evening, with extensive stratus coverage by
the early hours of Saturday morning.

Vicinity of SFO... MVFR-IFR ceilings through around 18-20Z. Breezy
west-northwest winds developing this afternoon, gusting up to 15
knots. Winds diminish in the afternoon with stratus developing in
the evening, although with moderate confidence in timing. Stratus is
expected to clear out late Saturday morning, although whether it
will clear out before the end of the present TAF period is an open
question.

SFO Bridge Approach... Stratus developing this evening should impact
the approach path before it impacts the terminal. Otherwise, similar
to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals... High confidence in MVFR-IFR ceilings at
MRY and the immediate coast through the TAF period. At SNS and the
inland regions, MVFR stratus expected to clear out late in the
morning. Breezy onshore flow will develop in the evening with speeds
up to 10-12 knots. Stratus returns to the inland regions late this
afternoon and persists through the end of the TAF period.

&&

.MARINE...
(Tonight through next Wednesday)
Issued at 243 AM PDT Sat Sep 16 2023

Light to moderate breezes persist across the coastal waters
today. The diurnal sea breeze, combined with terrain funneling,
will induce moderate to fresh afternoon winds with gusts between
20 and 30 knots in the San Fransico Bay and Delta throughout the
weekend before weakening next week. After a fairly quiet weekend
in the coastal zones, fresh to strong northerly winds and rough
seas will begin to increase in the northern zones by early to mid-
week. Light southerly swell and moderate northwesterly swell
continue through the weekend.

.MTR WATCHES/WARNINGS/ADVISORIES...
CA...None.
PZ...Small Craft Advisory from 3 PM this afternoon to 3 AM PDT Sunday
     for PZZ530.
