...New AVIATION...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 309 AM PDT Sat Jul 8 2023

Cooler than normal temperatures continue today and tomorrow as a
shortwave trough passes through. Steady warm-up expected
throughout the work week as ridging begins to build in from the
desert southwest.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 309 AM PDT Sat Jul 8 2023

A look at temperatures across the region this morning shows many
locations currently in the mid to lower 50s, with just a few
uppers 40s scattered amongst the North Bay. Another cool night, to
be followed by a cool day today with highs still in the below
normal range as the troughing pattern continues with another
shortwave passing through the region from the southwest to the
northeast. As a result, a bit of a rinse and repeat forecast from
yesterday with coastal and bay zones seeing high temps in the mid
to upper 60s, and inland areas generally in the mid to upper 70s.
Warmer interior pockets such as the southern Salinas valley and
North Bay valleys may see temperatures reach the low 80s. Onshore
winds in the afternoons to become breezy around 15-20 mph along
the Delta and Salinas valley before decreasing into the evening.
Lows in the night in the mid to upper 50s for most locations. Copy
and paste for Sunday.

Monday sees temperatures warm just a few degrees as a more zonal
flow pattern sets in. Despite the slight warm-up, temperatures still
exist in the below-normal range by about -5 degrees Fahrenheit,
with interior locations such as the East Bay Hills, Santa Clara
Valley, and southern San Benito county looking to reach the low to
mid 80s.

.LONG TERM...
(Sunday through Friday)
Issued at 309 AM PDT Sat Jul 8 2023

Looking towards the middle to end of next week, a pattern change
begins as ridging builds into the region. High pressure originally
forms over the desert southwest before slowly retrograding across
California around Wednesday, bringing steadily increasing
temperatures to the region. As of current standing, Saturday looks
to be the  hottest day with interior locations reaching the mid 90s,
and a few known "hot spots" in the region such as Pinnacles and
Parkfield reaching the low 100s. Looking beyond next weekend (the
15th and 16th) CPC outlooks suggest warmer than normal temperatures
stick around in both the 6-10 day, as well as 8-14 day outlooks.
That being said, stay tuned for updates as we inch closer to the
warming event.
