.UPDATE...
Issued at 855 AM PST Fri Jan 16 2026

Will allow the Dense Fog Advisory to expire at 9 AM PST for the
North Bay Valleys as visibilities have improved over the past few
hours and will continue to do so as the sun rises and temperatures
begin to warm. However, there is patchy to areas of dense fog across
the East Bay Valleys and the West Delta, most notably the Concord
and Byron areas as Tule Fog has spread westward. This area may not
see visibilities improve until late morning or early afternoon, yet
mostly sunny sky conditions are likely across all of the region this
afternoon. Otherwise, no updates are needed at this time.

.SHORT TERM...
Issued at 1241 AM PST Fri Jan 16 2026
(Today and tonight)

The 00Z sounding found a near record temperature at 850 mb (16.6 C
vs 16.8 C, avg: 7.4 C). This is leading to pretty dramatic thermal
belting, with warm air in the mountains and cold air settling in the
valleys. Healdsburg is currently 39 F, while less than 5 miles
away, the Healdsburg Hills are reporting 70 F at 1700 ft. The
cold valley air is reaching saturation as the temperatures drops
to the dew point. Patchy fog is being reported across the valleys.
The coverage is spotty and highly dependent on the wind speed.
Over the next several hours the coverage should continue to expand
and become more resilient as the cloud layer deepens in the North
Bay Valleys. The Salinas Valley is a little more tricky as mixing
from increasing drainage flow down the valley will counter-act
further radiational cooling. It`s difficult to say which effect
will win, but we expect the Salinas Valley fog to be thinner, more
patchy, and clear sooner than the calmer North Bay Valleys. After
the fog clears we are in for another beautiful day with clear
skies and mild temperatures.

.LONG TERM...
Issued at 1241 AM PST Fri Jan 16 2026
(Saturday through Thursday)

Nice, dry weather will continue for the next several days. Some high
clouds will roll in from the south this weekend, which should
moderate both max and min temperatures a bit, while producing some
colorful sunrises and sunsets. Ensemble cluster analysis shows
high confidence that the strong ridge at 500 mb over the Gulf of
Alaska will gradually erode over the next 5-7 days. The
uncertainty grows beyond the middle of next week, but either zonal
flow or a troughing pattern seems more likely than continued
ridging. While the change at the surface will be subtle, onshore
flow will gradually return, high temperatures will cool a few
degrees, and coastal clouds will start creeping back in by the
middle of next week. If the pattern becomes more active, there is
a chance for very light rain as early as next Thursday, with a
stronger signal for more substantial precipitation by the middle
of the following week (end of January).

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 353 AM PST Fri Jan 16 2026

VFR continues for most TAF sites through the TAF period. The
exceptions will be STS, APC, and HAF which will see fog this morning
and again in tonight for APC and STS. Winds will mostly say light
through the TAF period with directions being mostly variable,
although some localized effects will determine the wind directions
at a few of the TAF sites.

Vicinity of SFO...VFR through the TAF period. Expect mostly light
and variable winds through much of the day before winds turn
northerly in the late afternoon, but become variable again into the
night.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...VFR through the TAF period. East to
southeast winds last through into the afternoon before winds turn
northerly. Winds turn easterly and southeasterly again into the
night.

.MARINE...
(Today through Wednesday)
Issued at 855 AM PST Fri Jan 16 2026

Locally breezy winds expected across the San Pablo Bay, the
delta, and through the Golden Gate Gap through this weekend.
Elsewhere, light northeasterly to northerly winds persist through
the forecast period. Light seas continue into early next week
before our next round of long period swell arrives and brings
light to moderate seas.
