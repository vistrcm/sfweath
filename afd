.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 152 AM PDT Thu Mar 20 2025

Gradual warming trend through the early part of next week, with
temperatures 5 to 15 degrees above seasonal averages are forecast.
Chances for rain return in the middle to latter part of next week.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 152 AM PDT Thu Mar 20 2025

Isolated showers associated with a weakening cold front are
quickly diminishing across the Bay Area and the northern Central
Coast. The additional moisture will enhance the chances for fog
and low stratus through the morning hours, but skies will
generally clear out this afternoon, before cloud cover returns to
the Bay Area tonight. Low temperatures this morning range from the
middle 30s to the lower 40s inland and the middle to upper 40s
along the coast, while high temperatures hover close to seasonal
averages inland (middle to upper 60s) and slightly below the
seasonal average at the coasts (middle 50s to lower 60s).

.LONG TERM...
(Friday through Wednesday)
Issued at 152 AM PDT Thu Mar 20 2025

Friday will see another system coming into the western United
States, but the storm track takes the brunt of the impacts far to
our north, and any impacts to our region will be limited to drizzle
in the northern fringes of Sonoma County. The most visible sign of
this system in our part of the world will be the continued patches
of cloud in the sky, especially across the Bay Area, and
temperatures are expected to be similar to, or a couple of degrees
warmer than, those seen today.

This weekend into the early part of next week, an upper level ridge
begins to develop across the western United States, contributing to
a much more significant rise in temperatures. The heat will peak on
Monday and Tuesday, when the forecast highs reach the lower to
middle 80s across the inland valleys, with the coastal regions
reaching the upper 60s to lower 70s. For context, these temperatures
are around 5 to 15 degrees above seasonal averages for this time of
year. The forecast highs will contribute to minor HeatRisk across
the region, with potential heat-related illnesses limited to people
extremely sensitive to heat, especially when outdoors without
effective cooling or hydration. No heat products have been issued
for Monday and Tuesday, nor are any anticipated to be issued, but it
is notable that we are beginning to see these summer-like
temperatures return.

We`re also starting to see more detail about the unsettled weather
that follows in the middle to the latter part of next week. The
ensemble models are coalescing on a Gulf of Alaska-based low
pressure system bringing chances of rain to the region starting on
Wednesday. There are two major factors that bring uncertainty into
the forecast. First, the storm track appears to remain focused on
the Pacific Northwest and British Columbia. Our region would thus be
on the fringes of a potential system, where even a shift of the
storm track by 100 miles could determine the difference between
widespread rain and a nothingburger. Second, a lot of the final
impact will depend on how far south that low extends and how it
interacts with the upper level ridge as it moves through the western
United States. The latest ensemble model cluster analysis suggests
that the most impactful scenario for our region is one where the low
might not be as strong as in the other scenarios, but does dig in
further south, whereas a scenario with a slightly stronger low that
stays off to the north brings lesser impacts to our region. CPC
outlooks continue to suggest a lean towards precipitation totals
above seasonal averages to close out the month of March. The
operations staff will continue to monitor the evolution of the
forecast as it evolves over the next week.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 516 AM PDT Thu Mar 20 2025

High clouds has made it difficult to track the status of stratus
this morning. Nonetheless it has snaked through the North Bay
valleys and flirted or smothered Bay Area terminals this morning. A
break in the high clouds over the central coast shows stratus
blossoming around the Monterey Bay. Expect stratus to linger hold
through mid morning before mixing out. VFR conditions with breezy
north winds should then prevail through the period.


Vicinity of SFO...Stratus has loomed over and around SFO this
morning, generally holding VFR conditions with MVFR cigs flirting
with the METAR. Not many models did a good job depicting these pesky
low clouds, thus opted to try and follow the few hi-res models that
did depict this. If these are right, stratus will continue to flirt
and skirt around SFO through 15-18Z and should then become VFR.
Westerly winds should pick up with 10 to 15kt winds expected through
the afternoon and then decreasing after sunset.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...Stratus has blossomed this morning around
northern Monterey County, bringing KMRY and KSNS to MVFR. Guidance
suggests this holds through mid to late morning, with VFR conditions
returning by late morning or early afternoon hours. Winds will be
light and variable during this time before taking on northwesterly
component later and peaking around 10 to 15kt for a bit by the
afternoon. Winds decrease to less than 10kt by the evening.

.MARINE...
(Today through Tuesday)
Issued at 240 AM PDT Thu Mar 20 2025

The cold front will exit the waters this morning, leaving behind
it moderate to fresh northerly breezes. This will result in
hazardous sea conditions for small craft across the outer
northern waters through late Thursday night. For the southern most
inner and outer waters, moderate northerly winds become fresh
later in the day with near gale force gusts being possible at
times through Friday morning.
