.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 116 AM PST Thu Dec 21 2023

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 116 AM PST Thu Dec 21 2023

Early morning radar shows precipitation moving toward the Central
Coast (Monterey/San Benito counties) at this hour. Thus, lingering
rain showers will be possible over the region through the first half
of the day. Rainfall will range from a few hundredths to as much as
3/4" in the southern coastal ranges.

To the north, over the greater Bay Area, expecting temperatures to
warm into the low-to-upper 60s. Cooler conditions will prevail to
the south in response to cloud cover and lingering precipitation.

Tonight, weather begins to dry out as a weak short-wave ridge of
high pressure moves overhead. Generally expecting lows of around 50
near the coast to low/mid 40s across the interior.

.LONG TERM...
(Friday through Wednesday)
Issued at 116 AM PST Thu Dec 21 2023

Friday will feature mild and dry conditions as temperatures warm
into the mid/upper 60s away from the immediate coastline. A mainly
dry cold from will sweep through Friday resulting in cooler
conditions for the upcoming weekend. The weekend looks to offer
colder morning temperatures, with frost formation possible in the
more interior areas.

Unsettled conditions look to return by the middle of the upcoming
week. This is depicted in the 6-10 Day Precipitation Outlook with a
50-60% chance of above normal rainfall. Stay tuned...

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 346 AM PST Thu Dec 21 2023

VFR with high clouds around 7000-10000 feet spinning around an
upper low which is currently centered offshore from Pt Conception.
VFR will likely prevail through the morning with the exception of
small chances for lowered vis at KSTS/KLVK later this morning.
Some light rain will soon move through North Bay terminals. Once
this moves through to the north, dry conditions expected for Bay
Area terminals for the rest of the day while Monterey Bay
terminals still have the chance for rain late morning into the
afternoon. Generally light N/NE/E winds across the region will
continue through the day today. Light winds will start to shift NW
by the end of the period (early Friday). Chance for MVFR cigs
early Fri morning but confidence is low at this time.

Vicinity of SFO...Showers have moved out of the SF Bay region.
Light easterly winds will continue through the day today and will
become NW by late tonight into Friday morning. Guidance is hinting
at chance for MVFR to potential IFR cigs early Friday as a result
of a more stable airmass, light NW winds, and a shortwave ridge
starting to build in. However, confidence is low at this time.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...VFR through the TAF period. Breezy E/SE
winds out of KSNS will continue through the day, becoming gustier
in the late morning and early afternoon. Chance for more rain
showers increases after 17z this morning then tapering off by the
afternoon.

.MARINE...
(Today through Tuesday)
Issued at 346 AM PST Thu Dec 21 2023

Showers will linger over the southern waters through the day
today. Seas will abate through the day as northwest swell
diminishes across the coastal waters. Dry weather and strong
northerly winds will prevail by Friday into Saturday. A new
moderate period northwest swell will move through this weekend,
resulting in elevated seas of 10 to 15 feet.
