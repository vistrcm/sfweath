...New UPDATE, MARINE...

.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 255 AM PDT Tue May 13 2025

Isolated light shower activity winding down overnight. Gradual
warming trend through the rest of the week as ridging dominates
the NEPac. Another weak system slated for the weekend bringing a
slight cool down and breezy conditions.

&&

.UPDATE...
Issued at 842 AM PDT Tue May 13 2025

Isolated showers continue across the Central Coast this morning.
One minor change to the forecast grids this morning, as the
forecast precipitation over the Gabilan range and the eastern
Santa Clara hills was changed from drizzle to showers, but overall
the general forecast philosophy remains the same. The operations
team will continue to monitor the radar for signs of convective
activity through the day.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 255 AM PDT Tue May 13 2025

Radar remains in precip mode as of writing to account for some
very light showers still lingering across southern portions of the
area. Any additional rainfall will be very light or negligible. A
warming trend begins today as large scale subsidence follows in
the wake of the upper low. Overall not too much to add for today
besides the inclusion of some slight PoPs over the eastern Santa
Clara hills and Gabilan Range into San Benito county. Some
lingering instability may be realized as lifting is aided by
terrain during afternoon peak heating. Still not thinking much in
the way of measurable rainfall outside of a few lucky areas that
could end up with a few hundredths of an inch.

.LONG TERM...
(Wednesday through Monday)
Issued at 255 AM PDT Tue May 13 2025

Building high pressure over the continental west over the next
couple of days result in a weakened onshore pressure gradient
across the CA coast. This will lead to a lesser inland extent of
marine layer influence, thus, warmer daytime temps for inland
areas. Northerly upper level flow around the backside of the
departing low may aid in some weak offshore winds in the North Bay
with the weakened pressure gradient, but not expecting any
impactful offshore winds through this week. By this weekend,
another approaching trough turns upper level flow more
northwesterly, helping to restore better onshore flow. This
pattern may repeat to some degree by the end of the weekend into
early next week as upper level flow once again strengthens out of
the N/NE, promoting drier offshore flow as ridging builds
upstream.

MVFR CIGs are building for all but the North Bay terminals. Winds
will be light to moderate through much of the morning. CIGs erode in
the late morning, leading to widespread VFR for the afternoon as
winds become moderate to breezy. Expect winds to reduce into the
evening and early night. MVFR and IFR CIGs build along the coast
into Tuesday night, affecting HAF and the Monterey Bay terminals.

Vicinity of SFO...MVFR CIGs begin to erode in the mid morning.
Expect winds to stay moderate into the afternoon before becoming
more breezy. Winds look to reduce slightly into the evening with
gusts cutting off.

SFO Bridge Approach...Similar to SFO.

Monterey Bay Terminals...MVFR CIGS are building around the Monterey
Bay, with the last few showers exiting. CIGs scatter into the late
morning and skies clear into the mid afternoon. Expect moderate west
winds through Tuesday evening, and weakening later that night as
IFR/MVFR CIGs build.

.MARINE...
(Today through Sunday)
Issued at 842 AM PDT Tue May 13 2025

A fresh to strong northwesterly breeze will persist across much of
