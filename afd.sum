Along the California coast, expect some fog and blanket of stratus moving northward today, maybe some drizzle decorating your jacket like garnishes on a composed dish. Warm to arid degrees hit inland, above usual for late August, steamy like your favorite sauna, expect the sous vide effect. Return to work Friday brings a slow cool down, luring in northwestern winds over the waters during the weekend and into the week. Get ready for a breezy, atmospheric ride, my friends.
