Ah, my dear friends of the Bay! We dance in splendid sunshine this weekend, but as the tide of kings graces our shores starting Dec 2, cheeky coastal flooding might try a waltz with sneaker waves and those famous rip currents. But no rain here, so no celestial outpour is anticipated! Stay curious and remember: never turn your back on the ocean’s unpredictable allure.
