Morning fog seeping around the Bay Area like a hungover chef crab-crawling blindly for his coffee. Expected to lift by late morning, paving way for seasonal sunshine coaxing temperatures into mid-60 range...akin to a slow-simmer giving rich flavors to the day. Weekend forecast hinting at a drizzle dash of much-needed rainfall, mother natureâ€™s secret ingredient to refresh parched palette of our landscape. Watch out for the breezy weekend.
