It seems we're in for a culinary sleeve roll-up, duck-and-cover California special, comrades. Чую, что скоро развергнутся хляби небесные! It's raining, strong gusty winds are blasting towards us, with the potential for flooding and power outages. The higher terrain areas might bat their lashes at 60 mph gusts - aren't we lucky to score that! Brace up for Thursday, with legitimate wind and water artistry expected on Sunday that may flip the switch on the kitchen dynamics yet again. So, keep your aprons squarely tied, gin and tonics filled, disaster kits within reach and as we say, stay safe.
