Whoa! So, let's break it down! We've got some temperatures rising a smidgen above average today and Wednesday â€” hit 90s inland, and 60s on the coast! Humidity strikes back as stratus clouds hug the coast and creep in through gaps. It's all gray there. Come Thursday, things cool down, brought by a lazy low-slug coming our way, lowering those highs back to their comfy norms as we march towards September! For the fliers, the Monterey region wakes up pea-soup thick but clears up later. Winds kick up in coastal waters, making seas rough but only briefly! 

Stay curious and adjusted!
