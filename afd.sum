Folks, get ready for some cold, gusty winds sweeping through today and into Monday morning. The Bay Area will have folks mainly experiencing 25-30 mph winds, but some places might see up to 50 mph gusts. Cooler temperatures and those ubiquitous inland valley stratus clouds will make it feel like Mother Nature cranked up the AC. Rainfall will lightly grace the terrain-favored spots today into Monday morning. Oh, and more rain possible midweek! Чую, что скоро развергнутся хляби небесные! Keep those hats on tight and stay dry!
