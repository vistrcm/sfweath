Brace yourselves for cooler temperatures, an overture of clouds, and a dusting of light showers dancing their way across NorCal this weekend. It's a subdued performance, bringing a more hushed drama compared to the recent heavy deluge. With an enterprising upper low as maestro, the weather is taking a cool side with breaks of drizzly draman stirred up by the breezed marine layer. Don't worry though, we're in for a calmer show next week and a slow warm-up trend setting the stage.
