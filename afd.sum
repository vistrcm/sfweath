Pour yourself a final shot of sunshine, baby; once Saturday arrives the curtains are closing. I sense a story is brewing here, we're in for a "show": scattered thunderstorms along the coast, CAPE flirting with 100 J/KG—it's not chekhov's gun but it sure raises a glass for anticipation. Dealing with a low-level flow reveal too, as though nature's cookery isn't a chaos already. Anyway, I say savor the dry funk while it lasts, but у нас прогноз — возможно будут осадки. Then hold tight 'til next week for another sun-soaked ensemble, Norton-style. Uncertainty is our lamb in roast, folk!
