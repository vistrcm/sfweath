It's getting cooler, yay! The pattern is changing, so look forward to relief from the heat. The coast will stay mostly the same, but the interior areas will see a 5 to 10 degree drop in temperature. Humidity will also increase, helping with recent fire concerns. Flying conditions are generally good, with some potential for fog in Monterey Bay. Watch out for strong northwesterly winds and hazardous conditions for small boats. That's it, weather nerds! Stay cool, stay funny, and stay bendy. Bender out.
