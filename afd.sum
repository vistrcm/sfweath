Wow, guys, today's low might keep your blanket-loving self inside all day, and I bet you are itching to take the duvet off and soak in the sun. Well, here's the report: post-Tuesday, we can expect varying temperatures, but a little birdie-not so much of one, to be honest-- told me things should chill off well, especially by Wednesday. Be careful, though, if you want to spend time in the waters. There may be gale warnings, and driving-waves would pose danger to tiny watercraft. Watch out Alice, your goal of steering a houseboat might have to wait.
