Ew, I hate to be a buzzkill but we're gonna have a cool and cloudy week. The bad news is continued troughing might cause deep marine layers increasing the grand possibility of coastal drizzle and low-to-mid cloud covers almost everywhere. Nevertheless, Thursday onwards, expect cool below-average temps to slowly rise to near-normal, but stay low-key with mellow winds as well. Small craft advisories are still in effect in a few Pacific areas so everyone stay compassionate, stay in, or stay under covers unless necessary.
