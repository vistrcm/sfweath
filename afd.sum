It's a rollercoaster here, folks. We're looking at light rainfall scattering across San Francisco, particularly up north and around the Santa Cruz Mountains. Expect temps struggling to break through the mid-60s and dipping to a nippy mid-40s by nighttime. Early next week sings a warmer tune before another trough of low pressure swings in mid-week, stirring things up all over again, including chances of frost. Be on the lookout on high seas as well; hellish waves ain't friendly to small crafts. Safe sailing, everyone.
