У нас дуется вид свежей по погоде, товарищи. You'll get a break from downpours late this week with the frosty bite lurking from North Bay Valleys to Monterey County till 9 in the morning. Catch some high tides causing minor flooding in San Francisco Bay and North Bay valleys till Saturday 10am. As to next week, берегись, Зевс менталеталь backpack—he's already planning some new wet amusements for us!
