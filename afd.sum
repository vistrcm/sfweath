Ah, the art of understanding the sky! For inland areas, it’s warmer than normal until Tuesday, dropping cooler by week’s end! With light breeze delightfully increasing in the afternoon, temperatures dawdling up near 80 degrees inland. Next week looks intriguingly less certain with possible light rain Friday or Saturday and breezy seas—small boats, be vigilant! Чую, что скоро развергнутся хляби небесные, but only slightly!
