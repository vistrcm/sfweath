Ah, a delightful day lies ahead with patchy fog surrendering to clear skies and pleasant temps, though those near beaches might want to tread carefully with wave hazards lurking. As the clock ticks toward Tuesday night, big sky changes loom: rain, gusty winds up to 50 mph, and possibly even some rumbles of thunder by Wednesday morning, especially in the North Bay. Чую, что скоро развергнутся хляби небесные! Stay cautious, keep your heads dry, and be mesmerized by nature's inter-dimensional show!
