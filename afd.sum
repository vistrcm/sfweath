Folks, get ready for a cold sauté pan of weather — a double blasé of chilling fronts ready to shower the Bay Area with a light drizzle through Monday night. Fear not the raw side though, they unfold into clear cold dawns mid-week before cloaking us in yet another round of late-week rain. Mind the fog in the North Bay Valleys and Monterey Bay in-between for a good measure.
