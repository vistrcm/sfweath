Clouds, cooling, weak precipitation, and thunderstorms in the mountains have kept seasonal temperatures in the mid-60s to mid-70s near the coast and low 80s inland evident. There will be a minor rise in temperatures by late in the work week as high pressure starts to build, up to upper 70s and to the mid-80s. Nevertheless, this seasonâ€™s weather trends in this region include repeated cooling throughout the workweek after some minor spells of warming, mostly leading to adequate marine layer formations. Finally, Monday of next week, there will be a drop in temperatures, particularly with the pacific northwest and the weakening of an inland type of trough, leading into the occurrence of some internal movement leading to dry air.
