All hands on deck for today's fickle feast. Showers with storms on the side, both marine and overland, rolling through till tonight - potentially heavy rain, sturdy winds and lightning flashes as garnish. Shifting focus from Friday afternoon to night, we see moderate, widespread rain morphing into scattered post-rain band showers, before a mild drying with a warming trend come Sunday. Expect the Big Sur coast to soak up the biggest gulp of rain, tallying at around 1.5 - 2.5 inches. Now that's showmanship from Mother Nature.
