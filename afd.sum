Alright, let’s crack this nut!

Today, temperatures are cooling off a bit across our region, but heat advisories persist inland until 11 PM for Monterey and San Benito counties. There’s possible patchy fog along the coast and Monterey Bay in the morning.

From Friday onwards, prepare for more notable cooldown and a generous supply of seasonal temperatures, with highs dipping by about 10 degrees. Чую, что скоро развергнутся хляби небесные!

Note: Keep an ear out for potentially thick morning stratus around coastlines and airports like SFO and Monterey Bay.

Wishing you clear skies… most of the time!
