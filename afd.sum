Get ready for the heavenly taps to turn on by Tuesday night as an atmospheric river heads in, bringing substantial rain and strong winds, especially from Wednesday night through Friday morning. Keep your ears perked for possible thunderstorms too while hazardous gale-force gusts might just send your wig spinning! If you bust out the umbrellas, remember to watch the winds. Чую, что скоро развергнутся хляби небесные!
