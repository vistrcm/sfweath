Alright, folks, gather 'round for a tale of weather wizardry! 

This weekend in the Bay Area is slated to be pleasantly mild with clear skies, just a smidgen of coastal fog, and cool temperatures. Nothing too wild!

But hold onto your hats: come Monday, it's gonna get sizzling! We're talking hot and dry conditions, peaking on Tuesday, with inland areas breaking the 100-degree mark. Even coastal spots could edge close to 90 degrees. 

ðŸš¨ Fire hazard alert! Dry conditions and windsâ€”although not very strongâ€”mean fire risk hikes up too.

Marine enthusiasts, expect moderate northwesterly winds with gusts near-gale force in the northern outer waters and significant wave heights by late weekend.
