Today we've got light rain knocking at the North Bay's door, ready to break in by afternoon. Don't expect a solid soaker for SF Bay, just nimbles of rain dropping late tonight into tomorrow morning. Also, count on gusts brushing across coastal waters later this week, right after the seasonal warm-up comes to dry our wet friend by Tuesday--nifty but certain to ruffle your seafood platter. Keep the pans handy!
