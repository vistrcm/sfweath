Expect some morning showers, they're fading by the afternoon faster than a line-cook's patience on Friday night. Total rain around 0.5" for coastal regions but far less for the valleys. Cool temps though, lows in the 40s overnight. Few light showers across the weekend potential leading to slightly gusty conditions around Friday. It's like the sous-chef, blows hot and cold for no reason.
