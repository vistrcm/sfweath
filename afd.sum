Get ready for warmer and significantly naked skies this weekend, especially inland! Coastal regions stick near seasonal levels with stratus tanning opportunities. Starting overnight Saturday, there's a low chance for thunder and lightning scattered around the area. Keep the umbrella wit you in case lightning flashes will make you wanna break hydrants!
