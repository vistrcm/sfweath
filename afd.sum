In the way of a weekend brunch, expect a cooling trend stirred up by a stubborn low near Bay Area. The persistent chef on the weather menu are onshore winds mixing with low clouds, seasoning our days with patchy coastal drizzle. Daytime temperatures from lower 60s at coast to mid 80s inland. Kissed by a sea breeze, northwest winds up to 15 knots forecasted for aviation. Bon app√©tit!
