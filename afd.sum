Alright, folks, here's the weather magic decoded for you! Today we're roasting some more with warm temperatures but a change is in the air starting tomorrow. Expect those interior regions to sizzle in the 90s and folks by the SF Bay to relax in the 80s. You'll wake up to some coastal grey skies which will clear up by late morning.

Watch out for fog around Monterey Bay this morning too. From Thursday onwards, it's gonna be a pleasant cooldown through the weekend before a new wave of warmth hits next week. 

Hold onto your hats up north with some breezy winds on the waters; they’re going to linger through the weekend. No need for your ark today – it’s all clear on the rain front, but keep an eye out for anything sneaky!

Stay curious, stay amazed! כאן есть шанс на всё лучщее.
