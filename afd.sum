Here's a little tale from the sky! Today through Saturday, we're looking at a warming and drying trend. Sneaker waves and rip currents could make Saturday beach trips an adventureâ€”just be cautious, folks! A cold front will brush through Sunday into Monday, bringing cooler temps and gusty winds, like a gentle reminder of autumn's grasp. Dense fog might play peek-a-boo before 10 AM in North Bay Valleys. No rainy skies in store, so those heavenly floodgates stay sealed for now! Stay curious out there!
