Ah, it looks like we're in for a rather toasty couple of days! The burning sun will crank up temperatures today and tomorrow, with a Heat Advisory in effect for parts of the interior East Bay, South Bay, and the Santa Cruz Mountains. Watch out for heat-related illnesses, more important for the kiddos and the elderly.

Stay hydrated, wear some light-colored clothes, and remember: sunscreenâ€™s your best friend if you're heading beachwards! By Wednesday, though, things will cool down significantly as the weather transitions to more seasonably average temperatures.

Be cautious about the haze since light winds aren't helping with any ventilation. At the coastline and marine settings, we're forecasted for some gnarly, rough seas later in the week. Safety first!
