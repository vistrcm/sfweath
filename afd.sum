Looks like a front is marching through and winds are gearing up for quite a performance! Expect coastal gusts up to 50 mph from Saturday into Sunday. Mariners, batten down the hatches as gale force winds might churn the seas. Ah, but don't worry, hardly any rain falling—ориентируйтесь на ветра, а не на осадки. A slight drizzle may attempt a cameo, but high winds are stealing the show!
