Goodness gracious! The weather plot twists abound: expect cooler, below-normal temperatures starting Monday. Sunday kicks off with patchy stratus and coastal drizzle, while gusty winds put the charm into the East Bay, making it a bit fire-prone. Wind gusts can hit 40-50 mph, oh my! Coastal and mountain areasâ€”including gaps and passesâ€”brace for a Winterfell-worthy bout of hazards. So leash your picnics! ðŸŒ€
