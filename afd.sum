Alright, my curious and weather-loving friends, here's the scoop! 

Today's gonna be warm—5 to 10 degrees above normal, with clear skies once the morning fog and stratus skedaddle. Inland temps hit mid-90s while the coast lounges in the high 70s to 80s. The weekend cools down to more seasonal temps, but watch out! Early next week, offshore winds crank up the heat and dryness, sparking fire concerns. شاید, Heavenly floodgates remain closed for now.

Critical weather phenomena: Dense fog here and there, especially around Monterey Bay, where visibility is lousy. Offshore winds early next week will majorly heighten fire conditions—keep an eye on that!
