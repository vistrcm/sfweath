Hold onto your hats, folks! The gusty north winds are taking over the North and East Bay Heights with a grand Wind Advisory until 2 PM! Whew, gusts might reach 87 mph at the delightful Mt. St. Helenaâ€”serious stuff, eh? Fire weather concerns loom with these relentless dry winds so, play safe, and avoid open flames! On the brighter side, no rain is expected, and the temps are comfy, embracing the realm of the 60s on along the coast and 70s-80s inland. Winds calm through the evening, woohoo!
