Splendid weather ahead with temperatures near normal, rising slightly midweek, then dipping toward the weekend. Expect gusty winds — from moderate onshore flow today through evening across the Bay Area! While a hint of 'June Gloom' stratus lingers, dry air settles in. Marine layer stealthily fluctuates its deck along the coast. Watch out mariners for near gale force gusts around Point Reyes and Point Sur. Heads-up! Use care if you are feeling brave around Bay waters. "Чую, что скоро развергнутся хляби небесные" does not apply today.
