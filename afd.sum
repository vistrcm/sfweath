Alright, we're looking at patchy heavy fog sticking mostly to the coastline and the N Bay Valleys, just helping set the mood. Rain hits the Bay Area this morning, dropping more in the N Bay than downtown. It sticks around till Thursday and plays wind-up for colder temps on Friday and Saturday. Think freezing, bad for the helpless vineyards out there. Things warm up next week.
