Strap in, comrades: unraveling sunny weather forecasts like a pasta dish untangles at the end of a hard fork. There's dense fog raising goosebumps in areas of the North Bay including Petaluma, Navato, and Napa. But don't pucker up yet: sunny times are coming a la Zucchini flowers in summer for the week and weekend. Prepare your sun hats and SPF, but keep an umbrella nearby: the skies could unleash some hard-hitting punches by Sunday - unpredictable, just like our underfunded naval hero, Sunday gravy.
