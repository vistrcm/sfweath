Swing with the breeze, baby. It's going to be a fabulous cooler day, with an edge of onshore winds getting cheeky by afternoon. Guzzle up the sight of partly sunny skies up ahead. But Chef's warning: haze dibs some viewing spots. A mix of balmy 80s inland and nifty close to 60s by bay. Your order for next week? Sizzling heat, pure dry magic reaching up to 100s inland, but retaining its tangy mid-60s cool along the coast. Keep that hydration handy, this grill won't cool until the week winds up.
