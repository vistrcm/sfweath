Get ready for some hot weather through Monday with temperatures in the East, South, and North Bay soaring into the 90s and even cracking 100 degrees in places! Boy, that's toasty! The morning fog around the Monterey Bay area will give way to sunshine, and inland areas untouched by the marine layer will really feel the heat. Watch out for smoky skies due to the Gifford fire. Fire weather concerns linger with dry conditions and breezy afternoons. No rain, but it's perfect weather to practice your heat safety movesâ€”slap on sunscreen, stay hydrated, and never leave valuables in a hot vehicle! Stay cool and safe out there!
