Get ready for hot and dry conditions with temps 10 degrees above normal today, bringing fire risks and causing some trouble for the small, fine fuels like grass and brush. Hold onto your hats because weâ€™ve got some quite fiesty northwesterly marine breezes ranging from near-gale to gale force! On the brighter side, while a mix of IFR and VFR marks the skies now, expect clear blue elsewhere, leaving us mostly nice and sunny with more stable VFR skies by late morning. Tomorrow promises a cooler respite as temperatures realign with seasonal norms. It's a medley of mother nature's fiery tango today, play safely, my friends!
