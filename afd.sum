Today, the Bay Area will be cooler with some coastal drizzle—really, just enough to wet your windshield but not your appetite for adventure. No major fireworks in the sky as the chance for thunderstorms is low. Watch as a warming trend brightens the days ahead into the weekend. High clouds taking their time to clear, so pack a light jacket just in case. Enjoy the calm seas and временем нагреем котлы предстоящих знаменитых открытий!
