Hold on to your hats, dear folks! An active weather pattern is descending upon us with periods of rain, powerful gusts of wind up to 55 mph, thunderstorm sparks, and even some highland snow! Rain has started drizzling down across the Santa Lucia Range and Central Coast, continuing through Thursday. Watch out for localized flooding and tumbling trees with this blitz of nature's forces. Чую, скоро разверзнутся хляби небесные!
