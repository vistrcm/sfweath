Brr, it's chilly out there in the Bay Area! Freezing warnings till 9 AM. Wrap & drip efforts in full force. But, no need to worry about water falling from the sky yet. Come Friday, however, it seems we'll need to keep an eye and an umbrella ready. Чую, что скоро развергнутся хляби небесные! Snow unlikely, but who knows where that atmospheric moisture plume might waggle next week!
