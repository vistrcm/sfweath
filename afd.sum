Chaps, gather your umbrellas because it's about to pour heavily in the Bay Area and Monterey Bay this afternoon through Wednesday. Strong winds could make it feel like a whirling dervish, with the risk of flooding mainly in North Bay. Watch those coastal gusts, potentially dancing up to 40 mph! If that wasn’t enough, hazardous beach conditions are brewing for Christmas Day. Чую, что скоро развергнутся хляби небесные, prepare yourself!
