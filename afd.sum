Oh, magnificent! We've got quiet weather gracing us this week, with an enticing cocktail of returning coastal clouds and fog. Winds are on a decrescendo this delightful day, and temperatures are sidling back to near normal for our inland comrades. Now, on a merrier note: stratus clouds may gently smooch the coast by tonight, inching their way into Monterey Bay, San Francisco coast, and maybe even give those coastal dwellers around San Mateo a cloudy cuddle.

In the realm of the open seas, marine conditions are quite the turbulent symphony giving way to rough and gallant waters. Even with Monday showing a slight calming of traits, strong northwesterly breezes are still keeping the seas moderately choppy!

And listen closely: coastal regions may tangle tonight with the playful tides causing potential flooding shenanigans, so mariners keep your sights sharp!
