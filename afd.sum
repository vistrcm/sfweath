The sky practices its theatrical arts today in the North Bay with a few isolated rain showers, tease wave winds, and thunderstorm prospects from Monday to Tuesday, promising a three-day rain spectacle Monday through Wednesday—about an inch, maybe two or three uplifting surprises in higher terrains. Чую, что скоро развергнутся хляби небесные! Please drive carefully, as roads might misbehave with this first wet act of the season. Prepare for rough seas and sailing adventures on Sunday too—enjoy the Cosmic Cabaret of clouds!
