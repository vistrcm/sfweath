Oh ho! The skies will soon unleash their celestial waterworks over the San Francisco Bay area and Central Coast today and tomorrow, bringing 0.25-5 inches of rainâ€”plenty in those mountains! Expect southerly winds gusting to 30 mph. Thanksgiving keeps us guessing with a 15-30% chance of scattered showers, but drier weather prevails for the weekend. Hold onto those cosmic umbrellas!
