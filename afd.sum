God chuckles with us in SanFran this Saturday. Brace yourselves for chuystki, folks! Облако отвергает исходку к осени layered with generous wind gusts à la bourguignon. Heavier snow-cap in baking tray; don't count on crossing the 50s. Long-term, we see beefy rains trucking from Sunday, deadly amounts kissing Big Sur and Santa Lucia peaks (can touch 7"). Ой лихо! Besides, whipped stormy winds aim right at southern steak of California. The marine forecast isn't subtle wind-roasted; outlook warning broadens into Sunday. It's going to be one heck of a чует ‘satan's espresso’ brew around here! Stay prepared, cookie.
