Expect gusty winds today, just like the sharp hiss of an onion when it meets a hot pan. As high as 45 mph gusts in the elevated areas tonight. Enjoy the brief respite as the wind's fury subsides into the coming work week, slower than a weekend line cook sneaking a smoke break. The rest of the week is shaping up drier than Thanksgiving's turkey—despite Aunt Sally’s best efforts. You're getting an undisturbed, easy forecast just like we all wish we got during a dinner rush!
