Greetings, weather enthusiasts! An active pattern will shake things up near the Bay Area. Expect cooler temperatures as a cold front approaches and brings some rain on Veterans Day, with lighter showers possibly returning midweek and persistent showery conditions into the weekend. Чую, что скоро развергнутся хляби небесные! Keep an eye out for warmer rains and cooling upslope winds tomorrow, plus patchy fog and low clouds on Tuesday morning. Stay curious and carry an umbrella!
