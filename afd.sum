Get out your bikinis and breezy shorts. We're baking under near-record high temperatures that can hit even 80 degrees in places like Salinas Valley today and tomorrow. But don't get too cozy, a fat storm bundled with rainfall ready to hit us like a contraband poached egg on Wednesday. High winds and potential flooding expected. Better button up, it's about to get wild.
