Чую, что скоро развергнутся хляби небесные! Expect a big march of thunderstorms galloping over the Central Coast today and some late-night light rain squeaking toward the area. High pressure's elbowing in this weekend, a lemon to rain's whiskey — cue sunshine & warmth. Don't frolic blinded though, be on guard for gusty winds and waves that bite back.
