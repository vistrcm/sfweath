Oh, buckle up folks, it's getting toasty in the Bay Area: we're looking at a Heat Advisory lasting into Saturday for those inland regions away from coastal breezes. Expect sizzling temps peaking in the august 90s or even tipping into the roaring 100s. Relief might visit the coast first with winds bringing cool thoughts. Keep an eye out for a non-zero chance of thunderstorms, meaning dry lightning could possibly pay a visit. Winds could make the sea and small craft sailors quite jumpy, so best to hoist the sails with care!
