Hold onto your hats, folks! Gusty northwest to north winds will cause a brouhaha through the Bay Area, particularly over the North Bay interior mountains and East Bay Hills tonight into Monday. Expect wind gusts up to a rollicking 45 mph, reaching 55 mph on gusty ridgelines. Hazardous conditions in marine and beach areas due to high winds and rough seas. Stay tuned for calmer, sunny days ahead. No rain in the forecast, so rest easy under the California sun!
