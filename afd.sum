The weather in San Francisco peaks with a generous hint of heat, then mellows out to cool into the weekend. From your sun-tight porches, expect tranquil summer weather with near-normal temperatures by the start of next week. Mariners, brace yourselves - wild winds churn the northern seas until Saturday; better strap in the lobster pots. Just remember, folks, suspicious clouds are not uninvited guests, it is Monday's stew brewing from Friday's leftovers.
