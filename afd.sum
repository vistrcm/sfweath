This week offers pleasant weather across the Bay Area with light offshore winds and dryness through midweek. Temperatures will climb, reaching the upper 70s inland by Wednesday, posing minor heat risk. Meanwhile, the cool Pacific maintains coastal temperatures mild despite warmer inland highs. Moderate to fresh northerly breezes persist in maritime zones, cautioning small vessels. Be prepared for persistent clear skies without a drop of rain in sight! Without a cloud insight upon the horizon, radar repetition and titillation predict static saturation! контролируемые хаос и строгое отсутствие осадков parecem моей судьбой на этой неделе!
