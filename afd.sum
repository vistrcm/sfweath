It's a windy spectacle out there today with gusts reaching up to 70 mph in higher terrains like Mt. St. Helena! Critical fire weather persists with extremely dry conditions, triggering a Red Flag Warning until tomorrow morning. Expect potential rains next week as a mighty cold front makes its entrance. Stay cautious and take care!
