A warmer than normal day for the interior with a slight chance of **dry lightning** this evening. Sch, lightning drama without the rain, huh! Elevating threats until early Saturday. Expect **breezy afternoons** increasing over the weekend. And over at the coast, misty mornings followed by high clouds affecting visibility in some areas. Remember, safety firstâ€”cheer up, it's just physics in action!
