Anticipate numb nights and parched days ahead in San Fran and vicinity, and please hold that sneeze - there's a minute chance of rain by mid-next week, damn me. Still, brace yourself - frosty hints might snap you out of unseemly chit-chats around North Bay valleys and interior Monterey. Lively showers take a hike till next week while admirably pleasant days hold the fort.
