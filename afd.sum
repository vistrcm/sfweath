Alright folks, grab your shades and a water bottle because it's going to be toasty today and tomorrow! High pressure is cooking us up with temperatures soaring 10-20°F above normal, and humidity's in a rapid decline—great fire weather, unfortunately. Stratus clouds and fog along the coast will clear, but drive safely out there. A cooling trend starts this weekend—phew! Thunderstorm chance: slim, but stay alert!
