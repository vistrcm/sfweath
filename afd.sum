Here's the daily dose of forecast stripped from the cashmere rhetoric. Morning beach huggers, expect to be swallowed by fog clouds mixed with an aftermath of the sun. Also, that coastal mist is set to recede, exposing intimate 60-to-90-degree warming afflictions extending their reach inland, if you're into that sort of thing. Brace yourself mariners, gusty bits and wave-meisters coming your way this week. Comfort food, anyone?
