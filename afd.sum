Expect some wet adventures in Sonoma and Napa early Wednesday, with cozy rainfall blessed throughout the Bay Area. "Чую, что скоро развергнутся хляби небесные!" Wind gusts up to 55 mph lend drama! Dense morning fog around Monterey will scatter by 10 AM. Stay on alert for flood potentials and hang on to your hats! Remember to avoid those sneaky waves down at the beach, my ocean adventurers!
