Get ready for an inferno, San Francisco! Big daddy heatwave will kick places sizzle-side up, setting records quicker than a greased line cook (and it won't just be south and east parts getting the high temps). Bad news for hill dwellers not getting night relief and an the uptick "fire danger" making fallen angel-style havoc likely. Forget Чую lurks only sultry dry wind throwing invisible yet scary "specks" from exhausted ACs. Make best friends with any “якоїсь кафи та улюбленого холодного напою”. Not finally, gale chaser might delight seafarers in the afternoon till Tuesday. Do svidaniya cool, agreeable weather.
