Brrrr! It’s a chilly start in the Bay Area with a frost advisory, especially around Monterey and the inland valleys. Frost will nip at your toes and pipes, while gusty winds play tag over the hills. A rain teaser for midweek will flirt with us before proper puddles may appear on Friday! Чую, что скоро развергнутся хляби небесные! Watch for possibly stronger rains, but continue staying cozy in layers and look after those plants, pets, and pipes!
