Enjoy the pleasant weather through the weekend with slightly above-normal temperatures! Gently cooling starts on Monday leading into the potential for unsettled weather and likely rain by mid-next week as temperatures return to more seasonal levels. For those dabbling or strolling, be ready to conclude any garden tinkering or outdoor festivities! And oh, next week it seems "Чую, что скоро развергнутся хляби небесные!"
