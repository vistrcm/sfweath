Well, folks, brace yourselves for a warming trend. High pressure over the Desert Southwest will crank up the heat, especially heading into the weekend. Expect mist or drizzle near the coast this morning but otherwise clear skies by afternoon. Interior areas could hit the 90s by Friday. Weekend temperatures should stabilize, but fear not, more heat is on the way by Monday. Чую, що скоро розвергнутся хляби небесные!

High-flyers: expect low clouds this morning, improving to clearer skies by midday. Boaters: Gusty northwesterly winds will whip up those coastal seas.

Keep cool and look for lighter clouds at night, with warmer temps hitting the higher terrains by evening.
