Let me paint a picture: After a serene Friday, late evening through Saturday puts on a dark cloak of cold-rain, painting everything in its drenched attire. She wonâ€™t be a persistent guest though; with a flair for drama, she bows out mid-week, making room for her refined cousin - friendly fair weather. Foggy mornings and mild breezy afternoons will communicate her subtle dance. Craft the bottle of vodka out, though, and embrace blustery winds on a hot Saturday.
