This week, notice a stable weather pattern with typical June coastal charms—cool temperatures, nightly marine layer clouds with pesky drizzle possible, and gusty winds roaring through in the afternoons. Friday might get a bit cooler. Pssst, don't let those sneaky murder-waves catch you off guard at the beaches; they're in league with strong rip currents. Enjoy the ocean, but don’t forget, never turn your back on it!
