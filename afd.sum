It's going to be hot across inland areas, with temperatures reaching up to triple digits! Expect a moderate risk for heat-related illnesses, and keep an eye out for elevated fire conditions in the mountains due to low humidity and gusty winds. On another note, stay cautious at the beach as remnants of Tropical Storm Juliette swell up the coast, bringing hazardous surf and attractive, but deceptive sneaker waves! Wave those beach towels, but keep your eye on the ocean!
