The San Francisco Bay area will see some morning drizzle today with a possibility of gusty winds. The party won't stop there, though, as another round of rain is projected for Wednesday night. Rain bubbles won't burst until the weekend, so make sure to double-check those umbrellas. So, gear up for an unending mood of antennas-up weather.
