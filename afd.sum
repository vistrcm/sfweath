Get ready to roast, folks! We're dealing with a serious heatwave through mid-week. Inland areas, heed the tips to stay cool and hydrated because a cold front swoops in by Friday to save us. Today peaks at around 100 degrees in inland spots like East Bay and Monterey. Coastal fog likely, and there’s a small chance of thunderstorms—watch those skies! Relief is discomfort's wicked game, expect cooler yet windy and cloudy weekend!
