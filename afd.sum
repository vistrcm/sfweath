Heads up, folks! Warmer weather is moving in steadily through the weekend into next week. Those inland spots could feel a bit toasty Monday and Tuesday, but nothing too extreme. Early coastal drizzle, but mostly clearing inland by midday. 

Coastal spots around Monterey Bay might stay misty. Чую, что скоро развергнутся хляби небесные!

Over the ocean, look out for those building waves and strong northwesterly winds! Height increasing to 13 feet in northern areas. High winds forecasted, so keep a firm grip on your proverbial hat!
