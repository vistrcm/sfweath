San Francisco, CA here is what's cooking: near normal temps await you with a dash of offshore winds stirring over in the North and East bay hills heading into Wednesday/Thursday. There's a small risk of North Bay droplets next week while a cold front rumbles, and, keep your eyes skyward for some gusts firing at 20-30 mph. Buckle up, things might get breezy!
