Bolt the hatches! A subtle warming trend continues with lofty winds nearing by Saturdayâ€”gusts then reaching 50 mph along coast and valleys. Keep eyes peeled where land meets sea as gale forces prance across outer waters. As weekend breezes bid farewell, expect temperatures to sassily scoot above the norm next week. Watch coastal stratus development but nothing wet so leave umbrellas home. Voyagers beware: maritime tempests approach!
