Hold onto your hats, folks! Strong winds up to 40 mph are passing through the Bay Area. We've got moderate heat in parts of North and East Bay today, but cooler temps are expected over the weekend. Significant moisture will bring possible showers and an ignorable chance of thunderstorms on Saturday—Чую, что скоро развергнутся хляби небесные! Stay safe!
