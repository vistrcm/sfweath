Expect a chilly keyboard clatter in the mornings as temperatures stoop to the upper 20s, chilling out your Bay Area stroll. Keep an outfit ready for mid 50s by afternoon while the folks in heights shiver in colder breezes. A sweeping thrill of uncertainty wafts midweek uplifted by battling weather models. Monday to Wednesday, keep your ladles ready, rain could drop in unannounced. Just hope your pan isn't the Northwest and set the fire slow simmer, it might get boisterous from Friday night to Saturday. Bottle up that sunshine until then.
