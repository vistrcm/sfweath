Ah, San Francisco! Listen closely, friends! As the sun shines on this July 3rd, the winds will whisper wildly, gusting up to 55 mph in spots like San Bruno Gap and Altamont Passâ€”perfectly designed for kite flying or holding on to your hat! But don't get too cozy by the campfire; fire weather concerns are heightened with those gusty breezes and all the dry grasses around.

Expect some early clouds that will clear by afternoon, all under near-normal temps. Ahoy seafarers, marine activities face a dance with gale-force gusts, so grab those sea legs! And wherever you are, be on guard this holiday weekend, because Mother Nature is playing with the knobs, turning winds and clouds into veritable paintbrushes. Keep your wizard hats fastened, stay cozy, and outsmart those sparks!
