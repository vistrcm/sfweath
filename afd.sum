However beware chilly waves of wind are to come. Tomorrow's a dry spell, before rain and winds for the following week. "Чую, что скоро развергнутся хляби небесные!" so don't get carried away just yet! Stay safe out there—with rain and maybe even gale-force winds on the way, it's time for a cozy week ahead!
