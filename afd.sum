Here's the jargon wrangled down to just the need-to-knows:

It's cool across the region, thanks to a friendly visitorâ€”a low-pressure system. Temperatures stay persistently cool through the Labor Day weekend, with interior regions hitting the upper 80s and low 90s while the coastline chills in the 60s. You'll get your sunbathing in the afternoon after the morning stratus bows out, but hold on to your hats in the breezier coastal gaps.

No rain's on the guest list for this party.

Next week's still a tease, but a warm-up's coming!

Blaringly sunny days with a delightful breeze make it hard to argue about the Bay's air-conditioned peacock weather this holiday!
