Alright, folks, gather around! Here’s the down-low on the weather!

We're looking at temperatures flirting with or dipping just below the usual marks this week, coupled with breezy onshore winds and some early morning stratus cloud action. Patchy coastal fog is expanding tonight with a bit of a warm-up inland.

By midweek, things keep cooking inland with some spots hitting upper 90s. But, hold your horses - we might catch a few drizzly bits and pieces along the coast on Wednesday night. And come Friday, watch out, North Bay - you could get a splash of scattered showers. Чую, что скоро развергнутся хляби небесные!

Expect dry and warmer conditions to follow by the weekend. Okay, keep your kites ready and your umbrellas handy just in case!
