Set for an 8-day flamenco dance with the sun, San Francisco is entering the longest heat wave they've ever seen. The Titans of Heat pour from a relentless sky, pushing thermometers into triple digits for the parched lands while leaving the water's edge bearable. Hydrate incessantly, limit the alfresco libations and saunter indoors from late morning till evening. Fire-risk peaks close to cloud-laced tops, keep fireworks safely tucked. Cook, but stay cool!
