Much like chopping an onion, there's layers to this weather situation. We're starting off with rather troublesome dense fog across the San Francisco Bay area. Stronger offshore winds pulling the fog out later in the morning - think reliable sous-chef. Watch for static temps if the fog's sticky. Expect dryer, gusty conditions in the mountains and freeze warnings in the southern interior. Tidal level concern around Frisco/San Pablo Bay. Unsettled, wet weather to waltz in menu by weekend's end - nature's special.
