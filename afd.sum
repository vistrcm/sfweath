A chilly front passing through today brings light rain showers to the North Bay, touching as far south as San Jose by early afternoon. Чую, что скоро развергнутся хляби небесные! Gusty winds up to 30 mph will breezily accompany this; however, a delightful dry, warm trend with sunshine will follow from Friday into mid-next week. Coastal to inland areas will enjoy temperatures from the mid-60s to mid-70s, with some charming weekend clouds potentially enhancing sunsets. Keep an eye out for wind-related advisories, especially for mariners.
