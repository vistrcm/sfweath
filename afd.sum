Ah, the balmy dance of June Gloom persists! Coastal mornings in a foggy embrace lead to breezy afternoons. Expect a scatter of patchy coastal drizzle as the onshore winds whip up, gusting 30-40 mph in windy nooks. Inland, temperatures coalesce between the cozy 70s and snug 90s. The capricious marine layer may give us brief clearing but might briefly go tegen ochtend back to stratus character. And now to rain events: "Чую, что скоро развергнутся хляби небесные!" Although rain isn't imminent, keep your umbrellas cautiously optimistic this week amidst breezy skirmishes and evolving high-pressure ridges.
