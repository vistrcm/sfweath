Ah, weather, that playful dance of nature's elements! A cooling trend starts this weekend, bringing relief inland while the coast remains snuggled in its blanket of clouds, staying in the upper 50s to lower 70s. Skies will continue this rhythmic game of cloud-hopscotch. Elevated fire weather risk weaves its way around the higher elevationsâ€”keep an eye on that! And out at sea, sailors, beware of the wild northerly breezes stirring up dangerously rough seas at times. Keep exploring, keep wondering!
