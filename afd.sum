Ah, what a delightful mix of natural forces this Christmas Eve brings! We've got hazardous surf conditions with behemoth waves crashing around, a passing cold front drizzling rain and stirring up some gusty winds - imagine the sky performing a tempestuous dance! Чую, что скоро развергнутся хляби небесные! Thunderstorms are also not too shy about making a grand entrance through the afternoon. But fear not, for skies will clear by evening, ushering in a much nicer day on Wednesday.
