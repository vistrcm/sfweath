Wrap up warm with clear brilliance midweek, seeing as there's a sizable chill come Thursday. God's tears might be spattering across North Bay and San Francisco Peninsula late in the run-up towards the weekend. An angry sea throws up gusty winds and demands respect. Weekend looks crisp, buttoned up fitted coat kinda dry. Stay warmed, my compadres.
