Well, lovely folks of San Francisco Bay Area! Today, expect temperatures hovering around near or slightly below what's typical for this time of year. The stratus clouds are playing with our emotions, invading inland areas overnight and retreating back to the coast each morning. Watch out for a little morning coastal drizzle, just a teaser drop or two, really! Ahh, and there's that breath of wind cooking up a mischievous breeze up to 25 mph, particularly in the Salinas Valley. Elevated fire conditions persist due to gusty winds and dry air inland, so deck those smokey screens! A cooling trend barrels in, deciding to chill with us come Tuesday. Into the future, temperatures may tease a tug-of-war between a touch warmer or slightly cooler battlegrounds, leaving us with cozy uncertaintivity! And as it stands, marine forecasts tell tales of boisterous breezes for the northern territories, promising balletic prayers for sailboats until they ease back Thursday. Curious times ahead
