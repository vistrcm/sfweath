It’s blazing through San Francisco and the Bay Area! We’ve got ourselves a good old fall heat wave with temperatures zooming up well into the 90s inland and 80s on the coast - right into Wednesday night! Expect some fire risks too. Those mounting peaks might just crank up the winds and dryness. Don’t throw out your sweaters just yet; a coast-hugging sea breeze may toss that heat for a refreshing spin only to return spicier tomorrow! If you’re out on the water, mind those hefty 8-14 ft waves and gusty winds. Stay cool, kiddos!
