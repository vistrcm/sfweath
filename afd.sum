Heads up, my friends! A wild week is brewing! Tuesday night kicks off the show with atmospheric river storms leading to heavy rain, gusty 50 mph winds, and possible thunderstorms for Wednesday through Thursday. Our mountain tops may sport a snowy cap, too. Several rainy bouts persist into the weekend. Чую, что скоро развергнутся хляби небесные – let’s get ready for the waterworks and hold onto your hats!
