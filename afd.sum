Throw on an extra layer, folks—it ain't getting warm just yet. We've got cooler temperatures down in the 60s, and a northerly wind's whiplashing especially along the coast. By tomorrow, we might spice it up with a sprinkle of rain up north, but don't get your hopes up—it'll be fleeting, like those garnishes they sprinkle top shelf margaritas with. Then it's back to sunshine and finally, a much-needed thawing trend. Wait until end of the week, and there'll be another brief cold dip	with slight rain, mostly Sonoma end up. Depends on whether we've picked fortune cookies wrong; till then, enjoy cocktails au soleil.
