Ah, dear San Francisco dweller, prepare for a curious dance of clouds and sun! You'll see a sprinkling of drizzle gracing the coast and the Bay’s shoulders, reaching a modest adornment of up to 0.06" at the coast. Expect morning clouds to change over to a more stage-bright clear sky later today. The atmosphere is seasoned with a delicious onshore breeze that's stepping up, getting your kites aloft at mid-week. Temperatures, shy of their regular boldness, are going to keep things cooler than usual! If you're heading seaward, be advised of some feisty wind giggling along – listen to those small craft advisories! Stay curious, for the marine concert is continuous and very rhythmic with northern gusts.
