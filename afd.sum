Alright folks, here's what's brewing up in Bay Area skies today!

A trough moving inland still swirls those winds around, even as temperatures warm up a shade closer to what we’d call “average” for this season. *Gusty winds* this afternoon (20-40 mph, some spots even more!). Keep those hats on!

But here comes a fun twist—next week, we're eyein’ another trough with some rain probable Sunday into Monday. Чую, что скоро развергнутся хляби небесные!

And Saturday for you sea dogs? Splice the mainbrace, the waters might be nice and calm, at least till that next system sails in. So that’s a wrap. Buckle up, be safe, and always—keep looking up!
