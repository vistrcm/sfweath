Well, folks, it looks like Mother Nature's giving us a bit of a dance change â€“ the high pressure twirl is off the stage, and a chilly trough has joined in. Cool and breezy weather shall prevail, especially by the coast, while inland places stay mildly warm. Gale force gusts and rough seas for the sailors, so tighten those hats! As for rain, not much of a chance yet, but maybe some mischief in the form of isolated thunderstorms. Keep an eye on the skies, particularly by the midweek. Dive deep into that soup of weather dynamics as we drift towards the weekend!
