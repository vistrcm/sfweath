Well, let me spin you a tale of wild Tokoloshi-ish winds—whipping across the Bay Area today at 20-30 mph, with tantrums reaching a gusty 50 mph in the elevations—setting the stage for critical fire weather starting Tuesday and taking the curtain call by Thursday morning. By the Metrognome! Disneyland wouldn't serve you a wilder ride than this Rex block dream setup dangling from the sky—a cosmic dance of high pressure pushing in from the Pacific Northwest and low-pressure can-caning in the Desert Southwest! 

Dust off, buckle up with grip on your hoods, and say farewell to wave thrills in the marine belt as those forceful gusts morph from “very rough” to just “rough” in the next day!
