Bay Area's in for a zesty combo of wildfire smoke and strong north winds. Stratus clouds are expected to clear by mid-day, and the smoke isn't going anywhere soon. A shot of rain is coming to the North Bay early next week - first since May. Fire weather continues in the North Bay interior mountains due to dry conditions, and a Red Flag Warning stays in play through Thursday.
