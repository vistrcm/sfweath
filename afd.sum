Alright, let's make your weekend simple. It's last call for sunshine today before Mother Nature flips open her bar tab and sends in Saturday rain, starting in North Bay and maybe stretching to Santa Cruz by Sunday. Expect colder temperatures, spot of wind and lingering off-and-on rain through Tuesday. Wednesday & Thursday are looking dry but keep your umbrella handy for the weekend.
