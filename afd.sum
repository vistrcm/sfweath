Whether you want a comedy or the drama, here’s today's weather for the San Francisco Bay Area: morning clouds giving way to rays of sunshine by early afternoon, like nature likes to play peekaboo. Coastal areas might get some drizzle – "Чую, что скоро развергнутся хляби небесные!" Along the coast expect temps in the cooler upper 50s to 60s, gradually warming to the mid-90s for the interior. Coastal winds blowing through your hair will intensify by afternoon, especially near Point Reyes and south of Point Sur – koşarım maşallah is what sailors will exclaim in delight!
