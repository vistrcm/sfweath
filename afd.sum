Get ready for a gear shift, Bay Area folks. After another couple dry-but-cool-on-the-mornings, the chefs are turning down the heat by Saturday. Expect slight dip to temperatures with clouds on extra - yay, maybe a sprinkle in the North Bay tonight. Then a dose of light rain starts falling, could linger through middle of next week. Typical, non-grandstanding winter steps in.
