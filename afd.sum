Colder air today with a frost advisory in the North Bay Valleys—brisk like Ben Franklin's bifocals. Thursday could bring 0.25-1.25" of rain, gusty winds, and even a chance of snowflakes on the higher peaks. Чую, что скоро развергнутся хляби небесные! Expect morning frost this weekend. Be mindful of moderate river flooding ongoing in parts. Stay warm and dry!
