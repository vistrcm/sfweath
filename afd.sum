Oh, the weather mischief continues! Hang tight for some hazardous beach conditions till Friday, folks. Expect that pesky Tule fog in North and East Bay, as if someone's trying to fill your glass with H2O vapor incessantly! The day rolls with temperatures mimicking yesterday — nothing surprises skies anymore. Boring patterns depart by Saturday—light rain hovers on horizon next week, perfect backdrop for cozy cup of coffee.

What a cosmic giggle -- keep your dandy hats [and probably umbrellas] handy! Чую, что скоро развергнутся хляби небесные!
