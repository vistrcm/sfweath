Hello curious minds! So, it looks like an upper-level system is camping over the northern California coast through Labor Day, bringing in cooler temperatures and gusty onshore winds. Expect some cloud cover but donâ€™t get too comfy, it wonâ€™t hang around for long.

No rain, just coastal drizzle briefly; clouds fighting with sun for sky dominance.

However, higher pressures will soon win the battle and warmth returns mid-week.

*Critical Phenomena:*
Gusty winds, tricky marine layers, heat by mid-week, and fire danger heightens a touch Tuesday to Thursday due to dry conditions in high terrains. 

Alright, keep your sunscreen and good sense handy, itâ€™s gonna be quite a holiday ride!

Stay safe, keep an eye on your grill, and most importantlyâ€”never turn your back on science...or the ocean! ðŸŒŠðŸ”­
