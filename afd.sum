Expect the heavenly taps to open; banker's style, little nibble first and then full-blown rain in San Francisco come overnight. The chowder weather is sticking around, peppered with possible thunder fuss and storm hurdles, until Sunday. Cooler than yesterday's scorcher, winds are gonna make some minor stirs, especially on Monterey and San Benitoâ€™s tips. Batten down, boys!
