Ah, the cosmic drama of the atmospheric river unfurls with aplomb over the North Bay through Saturday! Flood Watch alerts sound, with rains crafting watery canvases of 5-12 inches in North Bay and 1-6 inches farther south by Sunday—more abundant skies on Friday, particularly! Winds zealously wield their might, blowing up to 50 mph amid advisories, while gargantuan 14-22 feet waves ensure marine antics at high surf pinnacles! Keep galoshes and inner mariner nearby—stay secure and dry! Чую, что скоро развергнутся хляби небесные для этой дремлющей ложбины!
