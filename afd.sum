Well, folks of the Bay Area and Central Coast, today is a rather uneventful cloudy day with a thick marine layer lurking about, keeping those temperatures cool and perhaps some drizzle on the coast and higher terrain. 
Wildfire smoke is meddling with our air quality—like a scientific experiment gone awry! What's really stirring that curiosity? Rain—and potential thunderstorms—lurking for Monday through Wednesday. Keep your umbrellas handy, as we’re expecting up to an inch of rain in some areas with system one starting this! Чую, что скоро развергнутся хляби небесные! But not to worry, our atmospheric escapades should be wrapping up by Thursday with some fresh air as ridges roll in and we see sunshine again.
