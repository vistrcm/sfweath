For this week, expect quiet and seasonal weather, with a slight chance of showers and thunderstorms from the Bay Area southward tonight into Wednesday morning. By Friday evening, cooler temperatures and increased rain chances will return, particularly in North Bay. Expect dense fog in some coastal areas and high waves at beaches—15 to 25 feet—through Thursday morning, posing hazards. Remember, "Never turn your back to the ocean!" Чую, что скоро развергнутся хляби небесные, come Friday!
