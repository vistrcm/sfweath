We're in for a warming trend through the weekend as an upper level ridge moves in. Daytime temperatures will reach the upper 80s to lower 90s for the valleys, mid to upper 60s along the coast, and upper 60s to mid 70s for the Bayshore. HeatRisk is present, so stay hydrated, wear light clothing, and stay in the shade. This trend continues into Sunday, the warmest day. Moderate HeatRisk continues for the interior regions. The marine layer will deepen by midweek, and we're keeping an eye on the potential for upper level moisture around August 10-11. Breezy winds and advisory for small crafts in the coastal waters continue.
