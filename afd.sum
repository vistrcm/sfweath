Ah, Christmas serves cool air and clear skies, perfect for Rudolph and Santa's sleigh! We find frosty advisories for inland valleys 'til 9 AM. Watch out, holiday travelers, dense fog might sneak up on ya! Keep those low beams lit while driving, to avoid a flashing introduction to physics' light scattering!

シリーズ storm systems join the Christmas congregation tonight, prioritizing North Bay's rain dance, posing flood or landslide risks as soils ye become heavier and wetter! The rest of you shall expect weaker showers interwoven through the ballad of festivity. Let us enjoy the day's intermittence, but not without passing our nods of respect to the possible looming squalls ahead! Чую, что скоро развергнутся хляби небесные!
