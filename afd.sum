Alright, folks, heavenly buckets are about to spill! Expect light rain across the Bay Area not enough to nourish the rats living in your dumpsters but brace yourselves for the gusty winds scratching the coastline at 25 mph. Bitter cold will follow, sending temperatures plunging down to the 30s and lower 40s - enough to freeze the devil's dandruff off scallops. Hang tight, the punches are about to repeat this weekend with more rain, stronger breezes and that eery high elevation snow. So wrap up, pour yourself a mug of borscht and hold on!
