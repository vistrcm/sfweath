Crack open a cold one folks, we're in for some summer grilling weather in San Francisco. Heat Advisory in effect through Thursday for the land bound, as they prepare for temperatures popping up to near 100 degrees. Без дождя да прикусить нет, translates to 'no rain to cool you off'. Exercise caution – surprises, rough ones from the sound of it. Are lurking just along the coastline.  Jeans and t-shirts be damned on the beaches too – might face sizable TLC with a sneaker wave. So pull out your polos and made-to-measure suits of lightweight, light-colored, SPF-incorporated cloth instead folks.
