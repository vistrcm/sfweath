That celestial borsch pot's stirred up, unleashing pesky pockets of heavenly buckets throughout the day, complemented by occasional hysterical laughter in nature, 'aka' thunderstorms. Chuckles persist till the tomato-love-red sun clock's out, briefly coolin' lows before spinning the borsch ride again with an eye on next week. Remain frosty and keep that rain gear draped, travelers and sailor's alike - peril still lurks 'sassier than José Andrés on spiced thistle'.
