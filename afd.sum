Alright, folks, here's what's up with the weather in your neck of the woods:

We're seeing some cooling starting today due to a weak upper-level trough. The coast and Bay Area are cooler, but inland spots on the Central Coast might touch 100 degrees. Expect temperatures tonight to hover mostly in the 50s.

The marine layer is deepening, enhancing the cooling trend with some fog around. Watch out for gusty winds, especially around OAK and SFO Airports. By midweek, a stronger cooling trend will further drop temperatures as a system from the Gulf of Alaska moves in.

Bad weather ahead? No significant precipitation this time.

Hold onto your hats with the breeze picking up, especially over the southern waters.

Stay cool and safe! 📉🌫️
