A cold front is sneaking into San Francisco, packing frigid winds that might leave us some frosty sights in the North Bay valleys by Saturday. Light drizzle may accompany this cold caller, but the serious matter is rugged offshore gusts setting stage later on the weekend, with wildfire threats licking their chops. So, checksum of our weekend: frigid breezes, chance of frost, and potential wildfire risks. Stay frosty, folks.
