Marvin: "Morning clouds stay on the coast, bringing cooler temperatures, slight cooling midweek thereafter. Breezy waves along the coastal interface state breezy winds. Occasional gusts do reach up to gale force, mainly coming from the coastal jet regions. No important weather phenomena to announce overall." It is not really good nor is it really bad weather.
