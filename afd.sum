Today will be cooler with some mid-level clouds. Low clouds around Monterey Bay in the morning will improve to VFR conditions. Breezy onshore winds at SFO, with patches of low clouds possible. Fresh to strong winds in the northern outer waters with gale force gusts. Small craft advisories and gale warnings in effect. No major weather concerns. Get ready for a less exciting day than Bender sneaking alcohol into his CPU.
