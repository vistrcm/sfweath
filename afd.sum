Alright folks, here’s the weather story in a nutshell:

High pressure is moving in and making it mostly dry and hot today, especially inland where it'll be 90s. Coastline highs will be in the 70s and 80s. Expect cooler nights with temps around the 50s. 

Tuesday through midweek, slight chances of higher heat but nothing too alarming yet—could see light onshore winds bringing some relief. Look for cooling trends and continuing dry conditions as we head toward the weekend. 

No rain, but plenty of sunshine!

In the skies, VFR for almost everyone—which means flying smoothly—with just a stubborn stratus cloud for Half Moon Bay. 

Mariners, expect some rougher seas due to building northwest swells, particularly by Tuesday.

Heads up: gentle to moderate breezes near the coast and moderate to fresh over the open water.
