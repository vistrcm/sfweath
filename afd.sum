Clouds are to blossom, and cooler temps will lead us into the weekend, particularly exciting is the rain arriving late Friday night through late Saturday! North Bay Hills and Valleys could see up to a half inch – Чую, что скоро развергнутся хляби небесные! – with less rain sneaking south. Ponder the brevity of a pleasant Sunday-Tuesday before perhaps more moisture arrives by mid-next week.
