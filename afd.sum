Get ready, San Fran, for a cold-front arm-wrestle movie this weekend. Expect an early knockout punch of rain and wind starting today into tonight. Don't bother leaving those umbrellas home. Showers could be as stubborn as a bone-in ribeye, lingering into Sunday. Midweek might serve up some rain appetizers too. Stay on your toes, or you might slip.
