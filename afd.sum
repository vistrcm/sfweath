Marvelous! Let's dive into the enchanting world of weather in the San Francisco Bay Area. Today and Monday will grace us with warm, dry conditions while our atmospheric ballet shifts midweek with gradual cooling and even below_NORMAL_ temperatures later on. Marine layers play shadow and light, with stratus clouds dancing along the coast. Meanwhile, firefighters keep vigilant watch on the Pickett Fire as conditions stay arid, but relief may saunter in as some coolness tiptoes by Tuesday. Winds along coastal crags like Point Sur will revel in gusty enthusiasm. Wonâ€™t we all be enchanted?
