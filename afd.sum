Seems like we're on course for a pretty quiet cruise, save maybe a little whisper of rain in the North Bay. The rest of the time, expect some warm and pleasantly inviting days - could hit seasonal records early next week. But brace yourselves for possible upheaval come mid-to-late next week when rain strolls back into town.
