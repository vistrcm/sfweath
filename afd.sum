The weather will be warming up today through Saturday, with temperatures in the 90s to lower 100s inland and a heat advisory in effect. Along the coast, temperatures will be a little warmer than normal, but a maritime cooling influence will limit warmth. A cooling trend will happen early next week. There will be stratus clouds in the morning and winds of 10-15 knots in the afternoon. Northwesterly winds will continue with gusts up to gale force conditions and light southerly swell.
