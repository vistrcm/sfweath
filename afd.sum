The weather's throwing a serious party this weekend, complete with above average heat. The mercury’s rising peaking in 100s in favored spots. There's also a Heat Advisory hanging around. Throw in steady northwestern gusts and you've got a spicy shindig. But no sign of Чую, что скоро развергнутся хляби небесные! (rain). Chill next week, stay hydrated, and remember the sunscreen! Hyz'ka (cheers)!
