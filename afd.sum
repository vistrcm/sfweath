Hold onto your chefs' aprons, it's windy out there, folks. Nosy upper low's bringing in breezy gusts, right along with Mr. Overcast, ready to shroud your beloved city. Expect a smidge of rain on Saturday morning for a quick freshness top-up, mainly south of the Bay Area. Dry, northerly hints will follow with a pinch of warmth to wrap up the week. Enjoy!
