Talk about a true meteorologist's delight! There's a frosty morning for parts of the Bay Area and Central Coast, under a thick blanket of clouds that create vibrant sunrises and sunsets. But don't fret, a gentle ridging swag is on the horizon, bringing a slight warming trend that will carry on into next week. Keep those scarves handy!

No rain in sight at the moment, so let the hymns of sunshine reign, at least for a few days!
