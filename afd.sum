Breezy onshore winds keep things cool now, with the summer marine layer shrouding parts of the coast. Coastal clouds may hide the sun, while interior areas will enjoy clear skies and warming temperatures. Gale force gusts possible near coastal areas. No significant rain is expected, but coastal areas might experience fog. Sailors beware, rough seas abound!
