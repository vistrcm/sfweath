Well, hold on to your hats and freshly coiffed hair, folks! Today’s your last cozy, pleasant day before a mighty warm-up mucks about. Beginning Monday through Wednesday, brace yourselves for sweltering heat with inland temperatures hitting above 100°F and coastal bits baking in the lower 90s. Fire risk is tweaked but no alarms just yet!

Keep an eye out—might make for a superb, blue-sky afternoon today, though starting out stratus-y with a bit of light drizzle ahead of the ridge robustly building. Mariners, expect knotty waves peaking at an audacious 13 feet! If bad: Time to set every fan to "high" and channel your inner air conditioning!

Strap in, ’cause the upcoming heat won’t spare neglecting anyone without a cool shelter! Apt words—stay cool, check on your neighbors, and mind the fire risks without high panic.
