Ah, the ballet of nature we've all been tuning into! Today sprinkles some cool alongside a breakfast cloud blanket, then becomes sunny: highs in 70s-80s inland and luxurious 60s on the coast. Watch out, by golly! The trek towards warmth begins tomorrow, especially inland. There's wisdom, too: delight in life’s outdoor treats, but beware, Wednesday will raise fire weather specters in higher ups—put out those matches, friend. Climb up a tree, dodge extremes, and discover the sky!
