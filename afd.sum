Unfortunately, Mother Natureâ€™s saying no rain but plenty more heat after today. It's not as cozy when you get afternoon sun along with high temps in the 80s and 90s late in the week. Oh, and chances of record-breaking heat mid-week too; even the waves are heated up with mild offshore winds coming into play. All this adds to the escalating fire weather concerns. Adventure safe, mi amigos.
