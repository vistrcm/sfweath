Get ready, friends. A clean, dry break 'til Christmas - seasonal eats and clear skies alike. Fog clutching the Bay hints at cooler nights, but frost stays high up. Beyond Christmas day, though, rainstorms muscle in late Tuesday through New Year. Expect gusty southerly winds coming along packing their own punch. Eyes open, fellas. It's gonna be an interesting holiday.
