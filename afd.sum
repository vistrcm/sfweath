Well, folks, here’s what’s brewing: We’ve got temperatures a bit cooler than usual for the coming week, quite a mixed cocktail of clouds hugging the coast, causing fog and some light drizzle this morning—could even put a damp sock in your shoe!

Expect mostly sunny skies inland today, with breezy conditions as the day advances. Next week’s discoteque of weather might warm up a bit more till Tuesday. Later, there might be more cloud play—with potential for some precipitation primarily in North Bay.

So, nothing catastrophic but need a sweater! Keep an eye if you’re sailing south of Point Sur; seas could be bumpy!

Чую, что скоро развергнутся хляби небесные — drizzle and fog this morning while patience practices its virtue!
