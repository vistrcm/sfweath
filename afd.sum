Picture this â€”a thick wool blanket of fog, snug as a hangover on a Sunday morning, draped over San Francisco and coastlines until it's burned off by late morning sun. Inner regions will enjoy a golden-brown layover, with temps reaching quite balmy degrees into sunlit cocktail hours. Watch out Monday, though. A cheeky cold front adding a dash of chill before things sizzle again midweek. So, a smoky blend of isolated fog, with a drizzle of briefly cooler temps and a dash of heat spikes.
