Ah, folks in the San Francisco Bay Area, it’s warm and dry through mid-week, but the plot thickens late week! Today, fog in the morning gives way to sunshine. But hold onto your hats, a complicated weather tango comes by week’s end, potentially coupling Priscilla's moisture with a cold front, maybe drenching up to an inch—or leaving nary a drop. Well, catch what you can! Чую, дождь скоро придёт!
