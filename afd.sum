Ah, the dance of the atmosphere foretells quite the spectacle! A cold front's grand entrance will grace us with rainfall from Friday afternoon through Saturday. Watch those roads; they're slick with hidden hazards! Чую, что скоро развергнутся хляби небесные! After this watery performance, things warm and dry up Sunday on. Watch for gusty winds next week—nature's way of keeping us on our toes!
