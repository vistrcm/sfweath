It's another weather repeat thanks to upper troughing, on-shore winds and low stratus. Expect patchy coastal clouds, temps trending below seasonal averages till late week. Then, a long awaited pattern change will see temperatures climbing above normal early next week. In the marine forecast, strong gusts favour small craft vessels until month end. Stay cool and hydrated, folks!
