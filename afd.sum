Чую, что скоро развергнутся хляби небесные! A cold front is sweeping through bringing rain early today, possibly a touch of thunder, and more rain later in the week. Skies will clear a bit into Tuesday with cooler temperatures. Mariners, watch for a high surf advisory and small craft warnings! Keep an eye on those waves, they are building up strongly through midweek! And hey, stay curious about the weather—it’s a wonder of physics in action!
