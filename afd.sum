Cooling and near seasonable temperatures expected this week. Inland hot temperatures easing, onshore breezes increasing. Chance of patchy light drizzle, gusty winds, and mixed seas. Increased fire danger far inland with hot and dry conditions. Keep freetime lit-inside and enjoy your doodling weather dance! Who's with me?
