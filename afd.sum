Ah, the enigmatic dance of offshore winds, expected to put on quite a show tonight and peak Wednesday morning with the North Bay serenading us with gusts of 30-45 mph. Although the skies hold tight to their precipitation, the coastal cacophony persists with hazardous beach conditions, while our beaches and mariners are advised to dance carefully with high waves and strong winds. King Tides will embellish the tidal tapestry from December 2 to 7. Brace for marine mischief today, but a calm returns post-Thursday. No rains are on the radar today, reminding us that it isn’t always raining on our parade!
