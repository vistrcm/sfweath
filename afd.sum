Alright folks, here's the scoop: The interior East Bay is hotter than a physics exam in June with a Heat Advisory in effect until this evening. Expect temperatures up to 100 degrees, cooling tonight as the marine layer sneaks back inland. Wednesday cools to near-average temperatures but nothing too wild in the skies for now. Ah, the joys of weather!

And no, I'm not cooking any new physics theories under the sun; drink your water, wear a hat, and stay cool!
