Frosty mornings ahead, folks, with a sunny treat into the weekend. Wake up to warmer highs only to have the party washed down by cooler, wet weather by week's end. Expect some erratic fog coupled with a side of coastal flooding. Then, unwind with the promise of rainfall busting some offshore wind drying effects only to spice it back up with a pinch of thunderstorms. Enjoy your weather adventure!
