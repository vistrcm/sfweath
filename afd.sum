Eyes on the coast, people! Surfing might be life for some, but doing it today = lifethreat. We're talking monstrous, twisting tides of 28-33 ft. Rainfall might well be your weekend guest, with 2-3" expected across coasts; even more, reaching up to 5" at specific locations--stay wary. High tides, potential flooding, and potentially winds gusting to 20-30mph or even up to 40-50mph. Cook indoors!
