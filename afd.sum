Expect the burners to crank up in interior parts of California this week, with temps soaring into the mid 90s to low 100s by Wednesday. Not your flavor? Wait for your serving of cooler weather on Friday, bringing temps below the usual fare for the weekend. Keep your hat on for the breezy onshore winds, especially hitting 20-35 mph by water view. Rains mumbled by model forecasts stay dim in percentages, stick around to figure how the batter thickens. Watch for the wind waves at sea as gale warnings blow in - steer clear if that's not to your gusto.
