Alright folks, brace yourself for a wild coastal trip. Kicking off with dense fog confusing North Bay commuters this morning, tagging along is swelling temperature heading towards mid to late week, just before embracing a chillier weekend. Beachgoers, don't let the high surf and devilish sneaker waves toss you around. Top it off with potential light rain early next week. There you have it â€“ buckle up!
