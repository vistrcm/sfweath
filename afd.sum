Brrr! A chilly start persists with frost and freeze warnings across the inland areas. Some light rain sprinkles are expected across the Central Coast—Чую, легкий мокрый "хляби" возможен воскресном днем. Plus, brace for gusty winds up to 50 mph in North Bay mountains. Also worth a mention: snow atop peaks with 4-5 inches possible and a slight chance of thunderstorms with small hail over the weekend. Keep your pets, pipes, people, and plants safe—it's a cool weekend, folks!
