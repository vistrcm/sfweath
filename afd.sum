Fog has descended upon the coasts near Monterey Bay and the San Francisco Peninsula with visibility at a measly 1/4 mile, advising drivers to proceed with caution. Expect above-normal temperatures today, cooling midweek, and possibly some unstable atmospheric antics come Wednesday. After that, expect a dry, warmer weekend ahead. So, will the heavens join our game midweek? Stay curious! Stay safe!
