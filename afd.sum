Windy, and the weather's offâ€”I dunno why their weather station is telling us to look out for maritime craft, don't we all live in puny apartments? Today we'll have below-normal temperatures with light breezy pace hovering around Central Californian valises. Looks like isolated showers are possible far out east, while the area chills until a gentle warmth over the weekend.
