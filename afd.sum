Море, it's like dealing with moody line cook: burning hot, then frigid before you know it. Sweltering till Thursday, but brace yourself for temperatures deserting normal on the weekend, falls into cooler territory. Thirst inland's getting a pardon, as a little spit-shine of a drizzle might grace us. Keep it cool, friends.
