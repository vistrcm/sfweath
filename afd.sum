Alright, folks! Here’s the scoop. Cooler weather starts today and sticks around through the weekend. Expect inland highs in the 80s-90s and bays in the 70s-80s. Coastal stratus brings some stubborn fog here and there. Winds will be breezy along the coast.

As warming picks up again by Tuesday, there’s a heads-up for increased fire risk due to dry conditions and northerly winds. Slight concern but stay alert!

In aviation, there's low cloud and fog especially in the beginning, expect winds and clouds to play hide-and-seek throughout.

Seas are calm for now; look forward to more northwesterly winds and increased seas late weekend.

Adventure safely!
