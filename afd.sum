Hey there! Today, we are mostly dry, but tonight, the North Bay will greet rain, spreading all around by Friday. Чую, что скоро развергнутся хляби небесные! Good news though, the weekend will dry out—with elevated surf facilitating spirited antics in the waves late Friday into Saturday! Watch fish do flips in the turbulent surf! Avoid hazards by avoiding the sea when it gets too playful! Stay curious and safe out there!
