Get ready for a rollercoaster of weather! Today brings above normal temperatures and a Heat Advisory remains until 9 PM in the Southern Salinas Valley—stay hydrated, folks. As we move into next week, temperatures will drop significantly bringing strong gusty winds, light rain, and a tiny 10% chance of thunderstorms to the Bay Area. Чую, что скоро развергнутся хляби небесные! Meanwhile, winds will get a bit rowdy on the ocean with small craft advisories in place and a hint of light rain Monday.
