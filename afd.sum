Embrace a chilly weekend, folks. Expect mild temperatures today with an increased risk for rip currents along the coast. Following a mild Friday, Saturday hits you with light rain, more like a classic cocktail, less like a mean martini. Sunday and Monday mornings host the coldest temps – dropping to mid-30s – resembling a polar-dipped shot of American whiskey. Beware the frosts and sharp gusts over the waters.
