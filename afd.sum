Alright, let's decode this weather mystery, shall we? We've got light rain sneaking into the Bay Area this morning with some potential for localized heavy showers but minimal lightning risk.

Чую, что скоро развергнутся хляби небесные!

There you have it, no need to look up in sheer bewilderment—Mother Nature's giving us quite the show today!
