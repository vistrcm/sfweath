Alright folks, here's the scoop! Чую, что скоро развергнутся хляби небесные! Isolated showers are hanging around this morning, especially in the East Bay, Santa Cruz Mountains, and the Central Coast, moving southward by evening. A cooler day with some rainfall up to 0.10" is expected, while winds, gusty initially, will calm down.

More showers may return Wednesday with a smidgeon of thunder possible. Breezy, but nothing like the huff and puff of recent winds. A warmup is expected over the weekend.

Hold on to your hats!
