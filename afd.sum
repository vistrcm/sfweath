Hey folks, here's the scoop. The weather looks like a comedy of ghosts pretending to bring rain with radar even showing some showers due to a shortwave trough. But reality check - itâ€™s mostly virga, rain falling from clouds but not reaching the ground. Expect warm and dry weather to continue as a Rex Block pattern keeps precipitation at bay. A bit cooler than yesterday due to some extra clouds, but nothing drastic. Remember to keep an eye out for patchy fog, and get ready for a warmer Friday.  Keep your sun hats out, and stay curious!
