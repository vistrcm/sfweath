Pacific Northwest is serving up a spot of high pressure that'll whip Bay Area cuisine with a hearty dry warmth, courtesy of the downsloping offshore breezes. As day stews in our atmospheric oven, temperatures will reach early October unusual highs, minus the burn of record peaks. The flavor profile might morph towards sundown, with a palatable hint of cooler coastal zephyrs towards the weekend. Take care on the North Bay mountain grills, fire weather sizzling due to rabid gusts.
