It's a crisp and cold Sunday, with frost kissing the land and dry air embracing the atmosphere until Tuesday. However, I'm sensing the heavens are yet to release their torrents—come midweek, an atmospheric river will bring bountiful rain and potential floods through Friday. Keep your socks dry and an eye on the sky! Чую, что скоро развергнутся хляби небесные!
