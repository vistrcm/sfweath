Ah, my fellow explorer of the unknown! The Golden Gate city is basking in some mighty fine weather! Expect pleasant conditions with slightly above-normal temperatures and light winds. No signs of rain - looks like the skies will stay clear for now. Offshore winds bring warmth, banishing the fog and cranking up temperatures over those hills. Watch out though, gusty winds are teasing the outer waters, so keep an eye on those sails!
