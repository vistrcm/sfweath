So here's the deal. Grab an extra layer, roll your sleeves, and get ready. You know why? 'Cause we're standing at the gates of Mother Nature's fridge until Thursday. Then, served chilled: ūragan knots on Friday spoiling the coast of Sonoma, Marin, and Big Sur exploration. The first rays of warmth start poking through the clouds by the weekend, helping you to saute in the sun reaching with only a side of wind. This lady ain't fickle. Dust settles, warmth hangs around me, teasing what to expect the following weekend – “слушай, ветра в прогнозе, be alert.” This weekend to be anchorman before some May-hem for hobbits of San Francisco. Stay tuned, folks. Anticipate, don't let it marinate. Go with Bourdain, beat the game!
