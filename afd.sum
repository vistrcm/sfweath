Hey folks, get ready for a toasty week ahead! High pressure is bringing a warming trend with temperatures in the 80s and 90s inland. A heatwave is expected Friday-Sunday, so stay hydrated and find some A/C! Heat risk is elevated and fire danger is a concern. Prepare for low clouds and fog near the coast. Cooling won't happen until next week. Stay cool and be safe!
