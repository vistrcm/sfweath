Well folks, we're cruising into a bit of a weather intermission today with clearer skies making a star appearance while rain takes a breather till Sunday. Then, brace yourself — light showers return Sunday into Monday, and the winds will kick up their heels, especially in the North Bay. So, prepare as we hear the winds will be quite gusty. The rain won't be a heavy heartthrob, but areas in coastal zones could see a respectable splash. Слушайте, что скоро развергнутся хляби небесные через пару дней!
