Well, folks, today around San Francisco it's a bit of a mixed bag. Expect some scattered light showers this morning, mainly north, slim chance for thunderstorms. Cooler temperatures are sticking around with gusty winds up to 40 mph, particularly in mountain gaps and valleys, so hang onto your hats! Evening's seeing cloudiness lifting for a somewhat clearer affair. Later in the week, more showers, minor rainfall. Чую, что скоро развергнутся хляби небесные! Enjoy the intricate dance of weather and stay curious!
