Alright folks, buckle up, we've got party crasher on the weather horizon.

Brace your belts for potential nuisance floods and desperately outrageous winds. This badass storm doesn't stop at a single round - shot chasers continue through Sunday. Forget tidying up the garden, secure your house and wearers of loose tela: be warned! Be ready for occasional, vibrant outbursts for the forecast - it keeps me entertained! Stay on your toes pals, we're prosecutors accustomed to studying Soup Aujourd'hui - the grind continues. Not regular moans on the roster for this shift.
