Oh, dear! The sky's having a dance party! Showers and sparse thunderstorms are cooling off by now, but the mountains can expect some encore zaps this afternoon. Breezy, with gustier conditions striking over waters soon. Ah yes, "Чую, что скоро развергнутся хляби небесные!" Be on the lookout for thunderstorms and gusty breezes hiking your morning commute. Coastal drizzle returns with warmth sneaking in tomorrow, climaxing to proper wetness come early next week. Keep those hoods ready!
