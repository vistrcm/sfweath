Brace yourself, folks! Tonight ushers in some rain, especially south of the Golden Gate, with a vigorous system on Wednesday night unleashing heavy rain and possibly even some damaging winds, making flooding a concern through Thursday. Чую, что скоро развергнутся хляби небесные! Beware those coastal waves which might reach 30 feet by Friday – stay safe, stay prepared!
