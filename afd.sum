Ah, California! Enjoy warm and dry days through Saturday, but beware of some unsettled weather starting Sunday. Fog is clearing up, but temperatures are heating up especially in the Southern Salinas Valley - a Heat Advisory may soon grace your forecast! Expect a refreshing rain on Monday from North Bay to perhaps a bit beyond.  Чую, что скоро развергнутся хляби небесные! Winds may stir northerly and the game of weather chess continues. Stay intrigued!
