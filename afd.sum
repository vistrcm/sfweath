Get ready for high adventure in the world of winds! Alas, they'll be battling strong from Monday to Tuesday, especially in the North Bay where gusts of 50-60 mph could blow you away. Offshore winds could spark thrill rides for sailors, causing hazardous marine conditions from small crafts. Sneakers at the beach? Not you! Sneaker waves and rip currents make a beach trip quite hazardous until Monday night. And those foggy, stratus-filled nights are rewriting old tales, promising morning chills, progressing to warm sun without a drop rain in sight. Keep your curious eyes looking upwards and make the most out of the dazzling satellite show, jettisoning clouds intertwining amigos! Perhaps February hoards secrets of downpour, so let's cross our fingers. Stay safe and strap on your wind harnesses, it's going to be a gusty journey!
