The weather today will bring you cool mornings with a solar embrace come afternoon! Watch out for gradual warmth, clear skies, and gentle breezes. Notice a temperature rise tomorrow, but — oh heavens! — on Saturday, light rain and chills drift our way for the Central Coast as a pattern change unfolds. Чую, что скоро развергнутся хляби небесные! A bundle of sunshine ahead, but cautious: there could be slight frosts in early mornings!
