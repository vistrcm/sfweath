We've high-pressured good times for a few days, folks - cozy sunshine and heartening north winds just like a hefty shot of vodka kicking warmth into your veins. But come the weekend, mamushka, the sky weeps soft tears, Spielberg-build-up time. So enjoy today, Zagajemo do miortvoj nochy!, that sweet lull before the storm. And brace for more cosmic waterworks next week. Choosy fortune returns towards month's midsection, dostatochno luchi solnca - plenty of sunshines on the cards right now. Чую, что скоро развергнутся хляби небесные! Smell that? Rains are brewing! Better batten down the hatches, kids - we'll definitely need booze to survive this.
