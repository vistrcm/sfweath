Hold onto your hats, folks! The sun is cranking up the heat this week—peaking around 110°F inland with a moderate heat risk. Meanwhile, the coast enjoys the cooler side of life, sheltered by marine layers. Watch out for sneaky tides causing minor coastal floods by Richardson Bay. Oh, nature, you never cease to amaze me!
