Today offers chilly mornings with hints of frost, especially in low valleys—perfect to test your brisk self-experience. Однако к началу следующей недели можете захватить зонтики, as rain revisits the Bay Area, bringing its transformative patter further south! Additionally, prepare for slightly windier and wetter conditions in marine adventures. Chill out today, but rain awaits right ahead.
