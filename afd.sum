My fellow weather enthusiasts, brace yourselves! Essentially, it's fog and stratus as usual in the North and East Bay with temperatures staying modest. The real fun begins Tuesday night with gusty offshore winds reaching up to 45 mph around the Bay, peaking Wednesday. Hazardous beach conditions with rip currents and sneaker waves persist into Wednesday with King Tides starting tomorrow. Let's not turn our backs on the ocean, eh? Stay safe and be ready for any blustery surprises!
