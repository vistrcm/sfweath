Ah, today is a day woven with gusty tales for the East Bay and Santa Cruz Mountains! Fire hazards linger like a matchstick teasing a bonfire. Expect northwest winds up to 55 mph through Friday with temperatures staying close to normal, аха барошад сэржав байхун месте расhew! And beware: even mounteous gusts can’t dampen your Fourth of July plans, but stay mindful and let one less spark keep fires at bay. Temperatures hover from 60s to 90s as stratus clouds waltz over coastlines in their own mysterious maritime dance.
