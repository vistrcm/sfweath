Looks like San Francisco is in for a culinary tour of weather this week. Mild days and cool nights on the menu initially, a side order of coastal stratus sprinkled with patchy evening fog for an atmospheric appetizer to next week's main course of wet and wild. That's right, brace yourself for a bit of an atmospheric river situation late weekend; deliciously tantalizing taste of rain. Talk about 'flavour' weather. Bon app√©tit!
