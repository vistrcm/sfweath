Here's the dish. Hold your horses for a calm and dry Christmas in San Francisco with a chance of coastal fog. However, expect the weather to whip up a storm post-Christmas. Rain begins Tuesday, lasts almost until New Years's. High winds and coastal flooding anticipated as well. Have your ladle ready, it's time to batten down the hatches.
