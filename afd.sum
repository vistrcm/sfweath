Hot today, rain and cooler temp by Monday as upper-level low pressure impacts until mid-week. Expect thunderstorms with the potential for small hail. Wet roads may increase the risk of car accidents, keep shelter if lucky to witness lights in the sky. All go back to dry for Wednesday to Saturday #Boring.
