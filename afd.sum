Молюсь Вишню, get ready to dance in the rain, folks! A weekend washout is cooking - first helping from cold front on Saturday scraping up moderate, windy rain, немного погоди, No darling, Sunday's here with the heavier course. The coast strips it raw, with swells and wind making conditions hazardous. Monday brings residual showers. Verve your umbrellas, ready your coats, and hold your horses till mid-week. Полная погодная каша!
