Hello folks, our kitchen - the SF Bay Area - is bracing for a change of seasons. Picture velvety fog in the North Bay valleys, reminding you of steam from the perfect Minestrone in the morning. Soup days aren't far. Change is brewing in the Northwest, bringing cloudier, cooler 'mise-en-place' with light rains through Tuesday. No umbrella till midnight over the Bay Area. Stay tuned.
