Here comes light rain trickling down the Central Coast, but as the sun rises, it bows out, leaving behind chiller vibes and drier air. Overnight temperatures take a free fall into the 30s Wednesday to Friday, with a Frost Advisory in effect for parts of the Bay Area and Central Coast. As for Turkey Day, expect sun and dry laughs, with eyebrows raising warmer into the weekend. Чую, что дождевые тучи стоят, но вскоре уйдут!
