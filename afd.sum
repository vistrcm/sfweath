Bundle up, folks! This weekend brings cold, clear skies with freezing temps inland and frost in select spots. But hold onto your hats because from Wednesday into Friday, an atmospheric river will drench the region, bringing 1-3 inches of rain and potential flooding. Чую, что скоро развергнутся хляби небесные! Oh, don't worry, the calm and cold mornings will swing right back into action, with things clearing Friday for a hopeful dry weekend!
