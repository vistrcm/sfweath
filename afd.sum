Ah, what a fascinating dance the atmosphere is up to! Dry weather dominates with a Rex Block pattern keeping our skies mostly clear all week. Gusty offshore winds continue through mid-week, dwindling thereafter. The Coastal Flood and Frost advisories may catch your curiosity, affecting areas with vulnerable cooler mornings. Gale and Small Craft Warnings signal that the mariner folks should remain vigilant as well. Uncharacteristically dry January might just play out, molehill for fire risk, but simmering interest for seasonal watchers.
