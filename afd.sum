San Francisco, hold onto your chai lattes, 'cause there's a cooling trend up ahead. Coast expecting swimsuit killing chill today, which will start sneaking inland come Friday. Weekend warriors, beware! Listen for the onshore breezes—they're your cue to layer up. Beach-goers, strut with caution; nasty waves want to ruin your picnic. Держись, друг мой, because despite the faint scent of fall in today's weather appetizer, risky amounts of heat are set to make a blistering comeback mid-next week.
