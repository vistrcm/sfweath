Expect another day of fabulous dry weather you've probably become be friends with by now around the Bay Area. Although a chrome-plated disturbance is sliding towards us, just itching to upset our rosy apple cart. By Thursday? Oh, man! The clouds start nosing in, kicking off a cooler, more humid stretch we'll be wrestling with even through the weekend. A citrus blast zapped, squeezed and drizzled with rain? And a pretty high chance at that. Even more on your plate towards Saturday night, so cancel those barbecue plans.
