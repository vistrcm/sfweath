Alright folks, this week kicks off with near to slightly below-average temperatures. Expect a gradual warm-up heading into the weekend. Today, we'll have a thick marine layer with cloud cover sticking around, and possibly a bit of drizzle along the coast. Mid-to-late week, you inland dwellers could see scorching temps nearing 100°F—so stay hydrated and cool!

Critical Weather Bites: No major hazards, but there’s a moderate risk of heat-related illness by week’s end. Gusty winds around SFO this afternoon reaching up to 31 knots.

Stay curious and prepared, and remember, a bit of drizzle means "Чую, что скоро развергнутся хляби небесные!"
