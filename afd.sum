Ah, the calm ensues for a few more days in the San Francisco area under clear skies. Inland valleys may see some foggy mischief in the morning. As we plot towards the weekend, smidges of marine layer clouds will sneak in and toy with visibility. Brace yourselves, as strong offshore winds are conniving to make a dramatic entrance early next week! But the rain... oh you’re scheming out there, aren’t you? No sign just yet - hold that umbrella dream for another day!
