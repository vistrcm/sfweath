West coast buddies brace yourself; Some heat on the menu with a dash of dry offshore winds, but nothing to cause serious heartburn. Best served Wednesday to Friday; inland valleys could see temperatures hitting mid-90s. Ill-conceived fire headlines are swirling; current recipes not conducive for any rapid spread. A grilled ridge of high pressure starts to collapse Saturday, introducing a cooling trend Sunday. Might get our next serving of wet weather by Columbus Day. Keep an eye on your appetizers.
