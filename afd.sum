Ahoy fellow earthlings! Rain is lightly dancing from Livermore to San Jose today, with cheeky showers and possible thunderstorms joining overnight into Thursday, with a whispered chance of snow at higher elevations. Gusty winds and rumbling thunder tiptoeing in. Perfect for an unpredictable show! Чую, что скоро развергнутся хляби небесные! More excitement marches in again by Sunday. Stay curious!
