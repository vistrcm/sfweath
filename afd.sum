Get ready, San Francisco. This weekend: calm before the storm, enjoy pleasant temps in the 60s, slight chance of light showers. Come Monday, we’re looking at significant downpours – several inches of rain rolling in, lingering around with persistent southerly flow for a few days. Coastal areas: expect the worst of it. Take advantage of the weekend, batten down the hatches.
