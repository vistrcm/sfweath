This week's weather begins with plenty of sunshine and slightly above-normal temperatures, bringing a nice pattern. But alas, cooler, wetter conditions set in over the weekend with overcast skies, strong NW winds, and moderate rain expected late Friday to Saturday—almost time to exclaim, "Чую, что скоро развергнутся хляби небесные!" Stay cautious with gusts that may reach up to 45 mph, hinting at possibly a wind advisory.
