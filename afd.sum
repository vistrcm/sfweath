A warm weekend awaits as temperatures climb today—upper 70s to mid-80s inland, and 60s to mid-70s by the coast! Expect another bout of mild offshore breezes on Monday. But ah, by Tuesday into Wednesday, rain and maybe even isolated thunderstorms could dance across the skies. Чую, что скоро развергнутся хляби небесные! If you're venturing out into the coastal waters, brace for some spicy near gale force winds starting Sunday afternoon.
