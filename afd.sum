Ah, dear weather enthusiasts, the "June Gloom" blankets the coastal region with persistent clouds and cooler temps, while sunny escapades await farther inland. Coastal drizzle and fog sneak in at twilight and dawn, touching highs in the upper 50s. Meanwhile, inland enjoy 80s to upper 90s under clear skies. Watch for fresh to strong northwesterly breezes off the coast and embrace change in Bay Area winds! Quite a remarkable dance of nature! But hold onto your hats, Чую, что скоро развергнутся хляби морские!
