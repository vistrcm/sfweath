Prepare for a melody of marine mist and charming coastal clouds! This week, the Bay Area dances with an upper low setting the persistent marine layer guard. Inland regions embrace cooler excursions in sun-dappled directions, while coastal zones cherish clouded companionship, all primed with breezy whispers.

On the briny waters, expect enterprising airs and rising sea intentions beyond Tuesday.
