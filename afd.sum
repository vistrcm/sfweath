It's time for the galoshes, folks! Showers today, mainly favoring the North Bay with some stiff southerly breezes. Not to fret, bigger downpours come Monday into Tuesday as low pressure over the Pacific conjures broader rains. Чую, что скоро развергнутся хляби небесные! A bright spot? A brief Thanksgiving break from the drizzly deluge with a promise of drier skies as we turn to December. If you're setting sail or flying, expect some turbulence from gusty winds starting Sunday into Monday.
