Listen up, folks! Here's the deal with the weather. Today, expect warm temperatures and a moderate heat risk inland. Cooling is in the forecast for later this week and the weekend. Pay attention early next week, because there's a chance for showers as deep moisture spreads into the region. Overall, keep your eye out for rain, especially on Monday, when there's a potential for wet and unsettled conditions. Stay updated and be prepared for anything!
