Gusty winds have calmed in the Bay Area, though a few remain at the higher elevations of North Bay. Thursday and Friday offer mostly clear skies and comfortable temperatures. By Saturday, we anticipate a return of offshore winds and chillier nights, with upper 30s forecasted in North Bay valleys early next week. Hold on to those hats this weekend!
