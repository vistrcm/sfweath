Alright, curious out there, gather 'round! The weatherâ€™s cooling down, thanks to an upper level trough over the West Coast. Inland highs will drop to the mid 70s to low 90s. Coastal highs, staying in the mid 50s to mid 60s.

Breezy onshore winds, gusting up to 30 mph, and those winds could elevate fire weather risks but no rain is on the horizon. Midweek leveling in the mid 70s-upper 80s inland.

And over in the marine world, expect fresh northwesterlies tapering waves to about 6 to 8 feet, but no torrential seas just yet!

Stay curious and keep a weather eye!
