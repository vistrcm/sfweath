Ah, what a delightful chaos of nature we have to explore! We've got patchy dense tule fog creeping in this morning like a cautious cat, signaling drivers to go slow and safe. Guess what? It's time to expect a drizzly sky unveiling its soggy spell today and throughout the week - Чую, что скоро развергнутся хляби небесные! Critical mention: Wednesday might bring a twitch of thunderstorms over North Bay with a high probability of wet feet this gift-giving season. Prep for a rain-dance weekend if you're traveling next week!
