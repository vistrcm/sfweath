Get ready for an unsettled weather pattern early next week here in San Francisco. Cooler temps, cloud cover, and increased chances of showers are on the horizon. The remnants of Tropical Cyclone Hilary are passing by to our east, so inland parts of the Central Coast may get hit the hardest. Watch out for some transient showers tonight, but rainfall amounts will be minimal. Expect highs ranging from 70 on the coast to the lower/mid 90s closer to Sacramento Valley. Lows in the 55-60 degree range, so you might feel a bit muggy. Hold onto your hats and keep an eye on SoCal - the effects of Hilary may cause some flash flooding. Good luck and stay safe, folks.
