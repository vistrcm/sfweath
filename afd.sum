Hold onto your hats, folks! Gale, high winds barreling in with gusts up to 65 mph are indeed likely, especially in areas such as North Bay. Thunderstorms are possible too. Expect heavy rain and some flooding — "Чую, что скоро развергнутся хляби небесные!"ést, so don't say I didn’t warn you—it's sooner than you might expect!
