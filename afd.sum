Ahoy, fellow weather enthusiasts! An atmospheric river has taken center stage, promising heavy rain, fierce thunderstorms, and tempestuous winds through today. Flooding’s a risk as rain pours of about 4-7 inches, while coastal areas witness wind gusts up to 70 mph. The high surf will be positively dramatic with 20-45 feet waves up. Чую, что скоро развергнутся хляби небесные! Frankly, it's quite a handful before conditions calm by the weekend. Stay safe and dry!
