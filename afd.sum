Get your barbecue vibes tight while you can, amigos. This weekend kicks off under cloudless skies and with high spirits, blessing us with high temps in the sweet spot of 60s to near 70. Sadly, upcoming weekday climbs this rollercoaster and slips into some cool, light rain by утро - sunrise. But don't fold your picnic chairs just yet - we jump back into dry and warm skin by late in the week. Packers and beach bums, you're in for a mixed bag! As for our fishing friends, brace yourself for moderate sea mob – the sea's tossing bigger curveballs with 12-15 feet waves by the end of the weekend... think Гроза - storm, minus the theatrics! Stick around, the roast is just about right.
