Curious weather events, folks! Expect gusty offshore winds in higher Bay Area elevations, up to a cheeky 72 mph! But slowly, they’re calming down. Coastal breakers lurk at 10-14 feet causing some beach hazards—rip currents and sly sneaker waves are certainly not to be underestimated. But generally, skies are dry—relax and take in the spectacle of high clouds painting a serene tableau across the Bay.
