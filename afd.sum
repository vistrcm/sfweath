Brrrr, a much colder week is taking over the Bay Area with frost advisories and a freeze warning on the prowl! Temperatures dive into the low 30s inland tomorrow. Foggy mornings clearing to sunny afternoons; watch out for a chilly New Year’s breath. Winds are picking up offshore, but alas, little rain ahead. Stay cozy, bike lovers, and don't forget your gloves! P.S. Drop cushions back on the patio—the skies are drying up for now!
