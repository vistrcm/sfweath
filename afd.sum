The weather in San Francisco for the weekend will be moody. Onshore winds will increase, bringing cooler temperatures and another round of marine stratus. Monday and Tuesday will be particularly windy, especially around the areas between Point Arena and Point Reyes. Expect gusty winds, but no rain or snow on the horizon. Watch out for gale force gusts in a few spots. For more content, follow us on Twitter and YouTube and NWSBayarea.
