Put down the sunnies today in the Bay area, folks! We're in for one hell of a rainy show today and Saturday with howling winds thrown in for good measure. Check your umbrellas at the door or be the laughing Verde on a bustling deck, high surf bearing gifts – the perfect cocktail for coastal heebie-jeebies. Enjoy your slurp. Bon appétit!
