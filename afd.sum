Here's a weather tastier than a haute cuisine. San Francisco bearing the taste of mild, cloudy nights and sunny days up until Wednesday. Expect a seasoning of breezy winds stirred in on Thursday. Unusual, patchy fog and stratus may provide a twist Thursday - slight chance of light precipitation. The weekend invites high pressure and warm sunny weather. Slight soup√ßon of rain expected for North Bay area next week.
