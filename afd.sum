Weather's behaving itself with near normal temperatures today and Friday, warming up a smidge for the holiday weekend. Coastal stratus makes a gentle comeback, swirling cooler air along the coast as inland areas enjoy sunny skies and light winds. The marine dance intensifies as strong gusts prepare their weekend show over coastal waters, bringing choppy seas, so boaters beware. No umbrella worth reaching for just yet!
