Alright, let's dive into this. It's a cloudy day with some drizzle and light rain mainly near and south of the Golden Gate Bridge this morning. The winds will ease up by this evening, so that's a little relief! It's a bit cool today and tomorrow might be cooler, but things heat up next week. The marine forecast predicts choppy waters due to steep waves - not very kind to small boats out there. Cloudy skied, though quite charming I'd say, keeping the theme of August alive with fair drizzle! Чую, что скоро развергнутся хляби небесные! Whether you're ready to splash in the rain or sip on a hot beverage, stay cozy out there!
