Brace yourselves for a weekend with warmth and quietude, but don't be fooled by the serene picture! Hazardous conditions at Pacific Coast beaches are lurking, with pounding waves ready to surprise you—those sneaker waves are no joke. Chilly foggy pockets persist in Monterey Bay, demanding extra caution on your morning commute—yeah, visibility's less than an Oscar winner's dress budget! Looking ahead to Tuesday night, a powerful storm is sneaking in, promising rain, especially showering North Bay, and winds spirited enough to earn potential hazardous wind protection by Wednesday morning. Чую, что скоро развергнутся хляби небесные! Pack an extra raincoat and keep an eye on storm updates!
