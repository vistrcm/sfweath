Akin to slightly overdone steak, temperatures in the Bay area are set to drop a touch as a weak, dry cold front dances across your evening. Expect a breezier knock gently shimmying the coastal stratus away. Days ahead look steady as a sous chef's knife, no drastic change in weather. Look out for gusty winds and the tentative return of coastal stratus midweek.
