Hello, friends! Well, it seems we're in for dry weather across most of the area until Friday. Ah, but the North Bay may sneak in a bit of light rain on Wednesday. Some chilly temperatures this morning kept things frosty, but a layer of clouds overnight may have kept it a bit warmer than expected. The wind's planning a breezy party by midweek, especially out on the waters. And Friday rolls in with a trough bringing more widespread rain - Чую, что скоро развергнутся хляби небесные! Stay warm and dry, fellow earthlings!
