You know what they say—when it rains, it pours! This Sunday, brace yourself for moderate to heavy rainfall across the North Bay with gusty winds possibly up to 50 mph. The rain will lighten as it spreads through the Bay Area before clearing up later in the day. Expect up to 1.5 inches in the North Bay and about 0.25 to 0.5 inches elsewhere. As night turns silent, frost and cold mornings will follow from Monday. Чую, что скоро развергнутся хляби небесные! Stay warm out there!
