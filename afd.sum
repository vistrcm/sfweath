Get ready for a soaked weekend folks. We're going to have steady rain rolling in today and going through the entire weekend. Expect two big soakings, one falling today and another serving on Sunday night into Monday. Enough rain to cause minor flooding, with the possibility of a landslide due to super saturated soil. Breezy conditions too with gusts cranking up to 45 mph. Don't forget a windbreaker.
