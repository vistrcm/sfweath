Alright folks, gear up; a lighter звено of last week's storms is gusting in, grains of drizzle bringing a half-inch soaking. Santa Cruz, keep an eye out for a heftier inch. Garlands of scattered showers cling till Friday, riding a chill assailing Salina, North Bay, n' San Benito with frost. Easing over the weekend, full of high 50s sunshine. Populate the park bench. Monday — cast an eye for a shift to the slushier side.
