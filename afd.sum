It's gonna be a typical day in San Francisco, with a well-defined marine layer and low clouds. But don't let that put a damper on your spirits, it'll clear up this afternoon with mostly sunny skies and seasonal temperatures. Starting Sunday, things will heat up in the inland areas with temps reaching the 90s to near 100. Stay cool, because that hot weather will stick around through midweek. Watch out for onshore winds and possible convection in the coastal ranges of Northern California. By Friday, the longwave pattern will shift, bringing cooler temps and a return of those breezy onshore winds. That's the forecast, folks. Now go enjoy your day!
