Alright, my dear friends, let's break this down and simplify things.

Expect things to heat up today with inland highs popping into the low 90s, extending Monday into Tuesday - moderated by some marine layer cool breezes. So you'll feel quite toasty, particularly in the North and East Bays, Monterey, and San Benito County. By midweek, temperatures will ease off toward normal levels.

It's foggy mornings and foggy evenings, with sunny and warm afternoons in between.

For you mariners out there, northwesterly winds will make things breezy and a bit rough especially north of Point Reyes through early Monday, easing off by Tuesday.

Critical note: Moderate HeatRisk could be a concern for those warmer areas not influenced by the marine winds!

No rain in sight for now. 

There you have it. Хватит тепературы!

Stay cool and keep an eye on those temperature changes!
