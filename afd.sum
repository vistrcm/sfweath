Marvin from The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy: No significant weather upsets or good news too. Warmer daytime highs across the interior, however, coastal areas will hold below average due to coastal stratus with slight late-week cooling. Growing patchy FG and no real precipitation is on the horizon.
