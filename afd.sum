Hello, weather explorers! We're starting in a swirling May Gray atmosphere with drizzles along the coast and some robust onshore gusts thrilling us but stopping short of a wind concert. As the week unfolds, things heat up with significant toasty vibes anticipated on Friday; a heat advisory is afoot as temps inch towards 100 degrees. Now, come Sunday, the sizzling sensation harmoniously cools down. There's a sprinkle of concern over potential dry lightning sparking fresh fires amid these hot and dry hits. Remember, secure those metallic seat belts, tread lightly with fire, and follow safe, cool protocols. Stay curious and safe, and may the weather games begin!
