A weak upper-level low is marching toward Northern California, possibly deepening the marine layer and bringing some morning drizzle near the coast. Otherwise, the weekend remains dry with temps slightly below normal. Warming up starting Monday. Чую, что скоро развергнутся небеса на рассвете!

Hazards: Slightly gusty onshore winds. Be mindful while swimming and grilling outdoors—safety first!
