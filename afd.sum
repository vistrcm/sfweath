Things are finally changing around here! A cold front blows inland, promising cooling temperatures, and at last, pushing this damned wildfire smoke out of the area. Howling gusts may reach up to 45mph later today, especially for you folks living high up. While we're not expecting rainfall, ingenious mother nature might squeeze out some drizzle on Friday morning instead. Weekend features a cool down and maybe, some extra spit from the skies. Proceed disarmed. Over and out.
