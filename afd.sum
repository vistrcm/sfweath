Well, folks, it looks like we're in for some moody weather in California this week! Today, we've got May Gray clouds with coastal drizzle and patchy fog. Чую, что скоро развергнутся хляби небесные! You'll experience stronger onshore winds, so don't let those gusts knock you off your feet. Expect impactful heat by Friday, with possible record-breaking temperatures in some areas reaching 100-105°F; take appropriate heat precautions, especially in the Santa Cruz Mountains. Fire weather alerts persist with concerns about humidity and wind but nothing alarmingly strong enough yet for official warnings; however, watch out for 'hot-headed' sparks! If you're vibing in the waters, guess what, those naughty northwest winds are creating some wild gusts for small crafts too. Remember, it’s not just the skies we keep an eye on; it’s the potential sizzle below ‘em too! Stay alert for unexpected thunderstorms which might bring dry lightning on Saturday.
