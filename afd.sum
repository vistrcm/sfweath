Brace yourselves for bands of showers and a slight chance of thunderstorms, particularly in Sonoma and Napa counties, from today through Thursday. Expect below normal temperatures and цигане польщеродыля. Meanwhile, soaring temperatures won't overshadow the core of the cool, moist air spinning through the region. Note the increasing chance for action tomorrow when the storm center sets up camp overhead. Fine tunes of thunder roll while scattered showers lend extra charm!
