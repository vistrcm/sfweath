Good day, weather adventurers! The marine layer blankets San Francisco and the Central Coast, showering coastal regions with a touch of drizzle. Beware the strong northwest winds should you find yourselves wandering toward the coast—чао ветры неиссякаемые! Temperatures will flirt with normal amidst the westerly dances of wind before a chilled weekend caress resumes.
