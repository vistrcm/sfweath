The coastal regions are in for a hot day while dodging the low-probability thunderstorms meandering about, seasoned with dry inland conditions posing fire risks. Safety dances across the beaches are advised due to hazardous marine conditions, ah, the marvels of our atmospheric cocktail! Temperatures will start to dance downwards from Tuesday onwards, offering cooler solace. Чую, что скoрo развергнутся хляби небесные, but mating dew drops will not find each other on the ground. Stay mindful, my seafaring and beach-going friends!
