It's quite the atmospheric tale we've got here, folks! Cooler than usual temps, a marine layer measuring up to 2,600 feet, and the likelihood of some drizzles - just misty enough to wet your glasses by Thursday morning! Чую, что скоро развергнутся хляби небесные, albeit in a drizzly way! Still, watch out for minor tidal flooding in San Francisco Bay. Hang tight, no thunderstorms in sight for now, but keep those rain gear handy. Stay safe, travel smart, and don't forget to look up and marvel!
