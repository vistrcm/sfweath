Brace your wine glasses and wrap up warm. San Francisco Bay is setting up for breezy highs and chilly getaways. A cold front is approaching, with increased clouds, but won't bring rain this season. A gusty side order in the hills and mountains of the North and East Bays is in line late this week, but thankfully it's just shy of wind advisory levels.
