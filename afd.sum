Picture this: We're in for a chilly change, as onshore winds bring cooler temps and partly cloudy skies. Along the coast, expect fog and some light drizzle until mid-morning. Today, daytime clam is disturbed by the probably rain on Sunday. Then it's dry till midweek when we could see another touch of rain. Beautifully unpredictable San Fran, making us dance to its rhythm with its everchanging weather.
