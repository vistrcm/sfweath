Alright, folks, let's crack this weather mystery wide open!

Today, the heat's hanging on with temps peaking around 100-105°F in the really warm spots. Coastal areas might see some patchy fog tonight slinking into the valleys — visibility’s a fickle friend there, down to 1/4 mile in places, so tread carefully. 

Come Monday, we’ll start to cool just a smidge before a cool Pacific Northwest trough kicks in by Tuesday. This means good news, cooler days back to seasonal norms. Winds will pick up midweek, mother nature’s zest in strong northwesterlies.
