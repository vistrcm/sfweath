Picture this: an upper level trough off the West Coast is spinning up a cool down today—the temperatures are gonna drop, 10-20 degrees inland and 1-10 degrees closer to the coast. Breezy onshore winds will prevail through the afternoon, calming down tonight with widespread clouds and potential mist or drizzle in coastal spots. Moisture!

Expect a slight cooldown overnight, increased humidity by tomorrow, and foggy, low clouds pushing back inland. The weekend brings a return of seasonal warmth as high pressure builds over the Desert Southwest. Let’s watch out for the approaching upper level low by next week.

Marine crew, brace yourselves for stronger northwesterly winds setting in by Thursday, rough seas rebuilding in the outer waters!

Remember, you meteorological adventurers: awareness is your best umbrella!
