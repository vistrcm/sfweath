Alright listen up! We got some unsettled weather headed our way. Cooler temperatures, more cloud cover, and chances for showers and isolated thunderstorms. The biggest chance for rain will be late Sunday into early Tuesday. Today, we got those stagnant upper level lows hanging around the coast, which means cooler temps, dropping about 5-8 degrees across the region. There's a 15% chance of showers and a slight chance of thunder this afternoon over the Diablo Range and Mayacamas mountains. Keep an eye out for an increase in vorticity in the upper level low, cause that means more instability for convective activity. The marine layer is feeling a little compressed, so expect some patchy fog along the coast this morning and tonight. For the long term, we got high pressure drifting to the southern Great Plains, bringing some increase in clouds and low-end shower/storm chances from Friday through Saturday. The real fun begins on Sunday when Tropical Cyclone Hilary is on the move.
