Here's what's happening in the land of fog and bridges! We're kickstarting a warming and drying trend through to Saturday but it'll be cool at first with low clouds lingering. Watch out for sneaker waves and rip currents along the coast by Saturday, and be prepared for potential unsettled weather returning on Sunday! Oh, and don't worry about the rain todayâ€”things drying up quite nicely!
