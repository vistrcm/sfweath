We're talking cool temps across the board, my friends. Indeed, the metropolis and interior valleys may feel reminiscent of a well-chilled martini, descending into the mid-70s and 80s with coastlines lounging at a crisp mid-60s to low-70s. Expect respectably breezy west winds, just to keep it interesting. The air will rebel a touch drier on Wednesday and the marine layer hangs like an old friend, deepening early next week.
