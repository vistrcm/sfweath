Today, the skies are taking a breather with ruins of morning showers drying up, and claiming some small victories with occasional clearings. Expect mug-in-your-face fog to greet your populous morn. Thursday is our last chance to dry out because rains—possibly offering a change-up between being moderately inconvenient and bloody rapid—splatter down Friday into Sunday, likely blowing a noisy gust. Expect a weekend dance to the tune of rain-soaked shoes.
