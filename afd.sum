The Bay Area will experience very dry conditions, keeping the fire risk elevated through late afternoon, though the winds have calmed. Moisture will gradually improve across the week, with a slight chance of rain in the North Bay by week's end. VFR conditions predominantly with potential for light breeze shift; light drizzle possible Monday and more this Friday! Ah, my friend, I suspect the vaults of heaven might soon open a bit!
