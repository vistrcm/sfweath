Listen up, the same summertime-style routine is set to shake up San Francisco for the next few days. However, we'd better prepare for a winter-chill reminder by the week's end, thanks to an upper-level trough season crasher. Just like a stubborn-to-leave bar patron, marine-layer stratuses are set loiter by the coast, while gusty winds like an over-choreographed dervish keep everything shrouded by the water. But, inland temperatures aren't getting the memo and are flirting around upper 70's and low 80's. With subsiding temps and an upper-level Ether-wielding-tabby yakking out seemingly dry winds at us, watch out my fair heat-averse friends- drink much water and take your precautions! No хляби небесные, though. Curtain call? San Francisco - A city making snobs and weather nerds excessively happy!
