Expect a cooler weekend, folks - a slight break before things heat up again next week. Moderate heat risk is slated for early week, you know what that means. Its heat will still slap you on the cheek even though not matched with 'батюшки!' - Thursday, get ready, it’ll be quite a ride, "ты будешь вспотел от жары!" And throw in some hell of a smokey haze on top of us from these fires around State... aad troubles do serve double! At least no rain on the horizon as yet.
