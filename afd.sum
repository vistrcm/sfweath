Don’t expect much change, folks! Unseasonably cool conditions will persist into next week. Daytime temperatures stagnant near/in-land low 70s and upper 50s - sunnier as it nears the ocean. In general, expect low clouds at night, morning and afternoon. There’s a chance of patch drizzle throughout the mornings with deep marine layers in place. Enough warning to beachgoers, "never turn their back to the ocean!"
