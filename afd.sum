Alright comrades, put on your thermals as San Francisco is getting a taste of Siberia with cold mornings and patchy fog thanks to the clear skies this weekend. Brace yourself for a rapid transition - we're going from 10 degrees below normal to a spicy 10+ above normal later in the week. Be aware there's a breezy pick up set for our Bay buddies starting Sunday. Скоро настанет тепло!
