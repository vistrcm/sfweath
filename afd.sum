Ah, dear curious minds, today heralds the warmest delights this week—a sunbath for inland souls! But get ready for a breezy spectacle, folks, as gusty winds begin tonight into the weekend, reaching up to 50 MPH along coastal regions, particularly near the Bay Area and Big Sur. Elevated fire risks await the interior mountains of Monterey tomorrow due to these brisk winds. No rainfall yet, so let not "хляби небесные" unsettle your plans just now. Coastal seas shall turn roughly adventurous with waves building to 12 feet—sailors, heed the gale warnings!
