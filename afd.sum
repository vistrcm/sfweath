Hold on to your hats, folks! It's like watching a weather symphony as rain and thunderstorms make a grand entrance Monday through Wednesday. Chances are high for showers sneaking in Sunday night and becoming a steady presence into midweek—"Чую, что скоро развергнутся хляби небесные!" Gusty winds are calming for now, but another weather system ramps up for midweek melee. Stay dry, my friends, and stay tuned!
