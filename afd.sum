Ah, the Bay Area weather is akin to an artist's palette, rich with gradients of clouds and sunshine! Until Friday, let's relish warm inland conditions while the coast lingers under its cloudy veil, thanks to the marine layer's playful spreading. Come Saturday, cooler times and robust northwest winds will strut in, harvesting gusts of 35-50 mphâ€”be prepared! Fortunately, skies will clear soon after. No rain expected, just wind and wondrous changes!
