Expect an odd menu this week in San Francisco. Look for a gale-forged helping of light rain served all over the Bay area today. Watch for entertaining flashes in the form of occasional lightning across the North Bay. Temperatures will be testing old records, generously seasoned with moisture ahead of the Monday specials: bigger showers, possibly converting to thunderstorms. Strong, robust winds are also on the way. Combined with some events spread over next week, we've got a 2-3 inch rain entree.
