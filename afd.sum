Alright, gang, buckle up for some weather fun! 

The temperature will hover around normal with breezy conditions through the weekend - nothing wild, just a lovely pattern! Expect some drizzle near the coast by Friday night/Saturday morning. Thunderstorm seekers need not apply. Winds will gust in the afternoons, tumbling to calmer depths by the weekend. Чую, что скоро развергнутся хляби небесные!

Heads up for gusts reaching 30 knots around SFO, and drinks by the dock will have a fresh marine breeze.

Stay curious, keep an eye to the sky, and enjoy nature's show! 🌤️🌊💨
