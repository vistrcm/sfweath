A cooling trend begins today with elevated fire risk in interior areas due to gusty winds and dry conditions. Watch out for significant coastal winds potentially reaching gale force, especially north of Point Reyes. No rain is expected, but keep an eye on those king tides and possible coastal flooding starting Sunday. Remember, when fire weather errs against us, precaution becomes paramount!
