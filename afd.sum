Ah, what a whimsical play Mother Nature's put on for us in the Bay Area this week! We're billing with nearly bland temperatures—60s along the coast to the 80s inland—and despite a fickle dance of night and morning clouds, we'll see neat afternoon clearings too. Now, mark my words, there's to be no rain, только нотки тумана обрамлена морским бризом! Winds will get a bit spirited near the west Delta with gusts up to 30 mph, enough to blow a hat off your head, so cinch it tight. The seas sure know how to make a grown sailor pause, with wave heights reaching up to 20 feet! Hold on to your sea legs till those waters calm by mid-week—promise you'll dodge the larger deluges as they pit their furies south.
