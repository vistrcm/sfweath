Ah, my dear weather enthusiasts! Expect temperatures a smidgen cooler than usual, with a noticeable cold trend starting Tuesday. There's a coastal drizzle and clouds lingering along the shore, while sunny skies will prevail inland. Winds will pick up, creating an elevated fire risk in higher terrains. Mariners, strong northerly breezes and rough seas persist in northern waters. By the weekend, things will warm up a bit. No major rainstorms on the horizon, but keep an eye out for that coastal drizzle!
