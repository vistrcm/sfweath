Gusty offshore winds in the San Francisco area tapering off by afternoon with quiet weather emerging but returning over the weekend. Wind Advisory in effect until 10 AM today, with potential reinvigoration next week. Grab your hats and tether your galoshes but no need for umbrellas yet – the sky juice is still saving itself for later. Keep an eye on the heavens; they may surprise us next week! 🌬️
