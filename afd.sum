Hola amigos! Looks like we're baking under the Sun this week; just a slight cooldown on Friday 'cause of a small trough, but otherwise, we're good. Be ready for a drizzle of coastal fog and expect temperatures as smooth as buttered pasta inland. Beware, the winds are stirring up slowly for the weekend, but otherwise, life -and weather- are good.
