The weather will be hot with highs in the 90s to around 110, and limited overnight cooling. Expect a compressed marine layer with stratus and fog near the coast at night. Stay hydrated, avoid outdoor activities from 1-6 pm, and be aware of the risk of wildfires. By next week, temperatures will cool off, and onshore flow will bring a deeper marine layer. In the marine forecast, expect strong and gusty northwesterly winds, resulting in hazardous conditions for small craft.
