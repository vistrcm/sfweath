Like the calm before a well-orchestrated dinner rush, we've got a cool shot Saturday brewing, cloud cover saut√©ing. Rain's joining the party Sunday with front row seats across North Bay and Monterey Bay from midnight to breakfast. Some guests may pack more punch - keep an eye out for potential afternoon thunderstorms. Normalcy resumes post-Monday with balanced temperatures. Cash in your rain gear, chief.
