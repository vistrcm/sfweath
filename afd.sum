Oh boy, my friends! Watch out for scattered showers and even a dash of thunderstorms today in the Bay Area. With temperatures dipping below normal, embrace the chill as Чую, что скоро развергнутся хляби небесные! Brace yourselves for cold temperatures tomorrow and possible freezing over the weekend. The seas are rough too, expecting mighty surf with king tides until Saturday! Stay curious and wrap up warm.
