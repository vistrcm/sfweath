Rejoice, you lovers of dry land! Expect some warm yet normal temperatures this week, with Tuesday the warmest. Now, today's another mix of morning fog and light coastal drizzle—sure, sounds like a skilled performance by our always mysterious marine layer. В это утро дороги берегите! Tomorrow kicks off as the ever-naïve ridge bunches up strength, only to soon abdicate to the more genteel, cooling trough arriving later this week. Stable but breezy!
