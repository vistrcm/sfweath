Warm conditions continue inland, with a touch of cooler shivers sliding in the forecast for the weekend. Meanwhile, the coast is swaddled in fog and low clouds. Drizzlin' is a given during the wee hours. In San Francisco, daytime brings high breezy winds gusting to 25 mph. As the week wears on, expect milder temperatures and more coastal drizzle amid gentle onshore winds.
