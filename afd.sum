Hey folks, here's what we're cooking up, weather-wise. Ready? High pressure's muscling into town, and that's bringing us a basket of heat. San Franciscoâ€™s under a Heat Advisory today with more to follow inland on Wednesday and Thursdayâ€”expect temps 10 to 20 degrees above normal! Inland mountain winds may reach 35 mph, heightening fire concerns, while a weak marine layer moderates coastal temps. Oh, and this weekend we'll cool off slightly with incoming trough action. Watch out for another heat wave emerging on Friday for the Central Coast. Midwest-style thunderstorms are looking improbable. Stay fresh! ðŸŒž
