If you're on the coast, expect fog and drizzle for appetizers in this weather-café. Cool winds sneaking in from offshore like a slightly nebulous cocktail this today. For those inland regions, temperatures acting like we're still in summer’s kitchen, high 80s to low 90s. They dip this week, but hold onto your cutlery! The winds are whipping up to around a gentle 20 mph.
