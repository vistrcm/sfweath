Tiny bouts of rain's making today a bit damp, folks. Watch out, going below freezing for North and East Bay valleys tonight through Friday. Scorning us with a frosty laugh, some more possibile rains coming up for us this very Saturday. Admirers of getting wet won't be complaining certainly, they get to do the same rainy dance on Tuesday too.
