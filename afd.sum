Oh, folks! Get ready for some lively sky antics: scattered rain showers, whispers of thunderstorms with potential lightning zaps, and a hint of small hail, especially in Monterey and San Benito counties. So, Чую, что скоро развергнутся хляби небесные! Gusty winds ease off today, but watch out for frosty mornings and freezing nights ahead this week. Stay warm, and remember those Four P’s of Winter Weather!
