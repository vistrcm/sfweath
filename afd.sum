The San Francisco Bay Area is zippering up for a dynamic dance of strong southerly winds and rain today. The North Bay coast would practically be performing somersaults with gusts up to 40-50 mph. Bay-side folks, watch out for some gnarly high tides from 9 AM to 1 PM today. Your fate tomorrow - lookout for frothing surf ready to break up to 20-26 feet. Taste the wild seasons changing with moisture-filled days to come, leading up to the New Year.
