Today's classic by the bay with below-normal temperatures continues. Look out for those gusty NW winds by Sunday and Monday, hitting 40 mph along the coast and in mountain valleys. Expect a gentle warming trend from Tuesday onward, with calm conditions making a nostalgic comeback! Better hold onto your hats this weekend!
