Warm and dry today with a dash of marine layer stratus—Charming if you happen to enjoy lingering clouds hugging the coast this morning. Temperatures could sizzle up to the weekend before cooling off with wind and possible light rain by Sunday. Чую, что скоро развергнутся хляби небесные! High winds offshore—boat owners, secure your hats!
