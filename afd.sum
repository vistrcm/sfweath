Greetings, weather enthusiasts! Today, the wind seems to be borrowing power from Zeus himself—gusts reaching up to 50 mph shall accompany your day as the infamous onshore gradients stir up blustery conditions, particularly near East Bay gaps. A damp, drizzly awakening had already shaken coastal regions! Чую, что скоро развергнутся хляби небесные!

While fire weather concerns sneak in by Monday with dry air pervading inland realms, prepare for a week where sunshine will reclaim dominance and temperatures soar above normal. Oh, the stories the wind shall whisper as it whistles by!
