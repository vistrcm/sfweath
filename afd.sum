A curious warning: enjoy today — rain returns late Saturday evening into much of next week (heaviest Sun–Wed); Чую, что скоро развергнутся хляби небесные! Expect 3–6″ (mountains highest), gusty 30–40+ mph southerlies, hazardous surf, rising flood nuisance, colder air and mountain flurries — models now more in agreement than yesterday.
