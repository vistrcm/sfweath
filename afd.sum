Shiny days and frosty mornings, my friends! While temperatures are set to warm up slightly by Thursday, the weekend chills out again with cool air and minor rain/snow prospects on elevated terrains. Gale force winds by the end of Friday promise rough seas. Чую, что скоро развергнутся хляби небесные: Prepare for some sprinkles rising from Friday through the weekend, though measly in amount. Keep your scarves handy and hang on tight!
