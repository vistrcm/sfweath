Expect a tantalizing mild weekend, folks. The chef's handing us fiery grills near record heat on Sunday and Monday. Weather toenails, match lit. Next crazy train of storms, brings widespread downpours baker-style, arrive midweek, boiling and broiling towards late weekend. Reservations booked for Southeasterly wind and Westerly sea wave dinners, and rivers served fine, no floods yet note below damn levee safety. Steamed aviation foresafety, intact.
