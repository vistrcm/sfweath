Cooking up a storm this Tuesday in San Francisco Bay, folks. Isolated bouts served with high-based thunderstorms hold potential for grass fires - sour garnish for the day. A little watering might help, just a smidgen, but don't count on it. Unfortunately, I forgot my umbrella last time I visited Ukraine, still "Будьте уважні!" That rough ride swings through until dusk, the cool relief Wednesday expected to season the ground a touch.
