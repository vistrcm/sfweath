Oh no! Heartbreak in San Francisco! The weather forecast for the remainder of the week is mostly cloudy mornings giving way to sun in the afternoon. Boo! Everyone better grab a jacket since temperatures will be slightly below season averages. Fog may even linger near the coast until Thursday morning so people going to beach have to bring towels and a space heater!
