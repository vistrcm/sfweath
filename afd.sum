Imagine sliding a knife right through a fresh Cioppino on a crisp San Francisco morning. Unsettled weather is sashaying in by late Tuesday lasting into Wednesday. Expect a gust of southerly winds amidst rain; probably get cozy with an umbrella. More rain is cued for Friday and Saturday too; think very thoroughly ladled Minestrone around the weekend. Keep wary, boils and ghouls; it's studded with bite-sized hazards.
