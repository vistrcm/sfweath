Well, folks, gear up for night and morning cloud cover with coastal lift-off by every afternoon. Let’s enjoy 'slightly' warmer temperatures today, but there’s more heating and drying drama up next week. Expect stubborn morning clouds to withdraw earlier, boosted by surging high-pressure aloha, leading to another slight bump in the thermostat. Strong winds pose as bouncers for the coast, leading to a drop in water temperatures. Brace for triple digits by mid-next week in the interiors, followed by a breeze of cooling relief to end the week. Boating Foodies, expect fierce winds in coastal waters. High winds bring bad dining experiences!
