The weekend keeps us on our toes with a fascinating competition between early stratus clouds and later clearing! Expect highs up to the 90s inland. Heads up for stronger coastal and mountain gap winds come Sunday and Mondayâ€”prime time for elevated fire risk. Watch for those pesky marine layers at night, particularly with some fog and localized drizzles.
