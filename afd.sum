Bay Area, gear up for a giddy rain dance with two rounds of showers and gusty winds bearing down. (And by bear down, I mean opening some solid Umbrella App Stand specials.) First rain begins today, but hide your smokes, the meaty chunk comes by late afternoon. Thursday, be ready to navigate puddles till mid-week. Suck in that oh, so sweet petrichor! Expect slightly heavier system on Friday with potential storms. No hazardous winds, but enough to spill a shaky consomm√©. Comfy drought-break kicks in Sunday - toque off to high pressure!
