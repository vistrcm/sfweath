Temperatures will stay around normal, with breezy onshore flow making it quite pleasant. Mostly clear skies, though some coastal areas will see morning fog. Gusty winds, especially through Saturday, need watching. Marine layer could bring morning drizzle on the coast. Low risk of fire threats due to good moisture. Gale force gusts likely in outer waters, particularly south of Point Sur.

Critical weather: Gusty winds and localized drizzle near the coast.
