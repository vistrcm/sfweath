Ladies and gents, we got a scorcher on our hands! Slap some sunscreen on your nose because we're looking at high 90's, maybe even skimming 110 in the more remote suntan centers like Monterey or San Benito. There's a heat advisory from 10 AM today till 11 PM tomorrow, you'd do better enjoying a pierogi indoors. The coast can expect 60-70 degrees, a main of pesky fog served with sides of drizzle and stratus clouds. This won't last, though. Late Monday things will cool down again. Finally, on our marine front, a heads up for sailors: humming large gusty winds in the north.
