Weather alert, folks! Get ready for some serious heat in the coming days. Today, we'll see areas of Moderate HeatRisk developing in inland areas as a result of a strengthening high-pressure system. Temperatures will rise, hitting mid-90s to low 100s for some parts of Napa County, Sonoma County, Santa Clara Valley, the East Bay, and southern Monterey County. By Sunday, we'll reach the peak of this heat event with highs in the low to mid 100s for inland valleys. Stay cool, stay hydrated, and most importantly, stay the f*** inside with the air conditioning cranked up. But guess what? Relief is in sight! By early next week, temperatures will cool down as an upper trough takes over from the ridge. So, prepare for the hot days, but remember that cooler days are on their way. Keep ya eyes open!
