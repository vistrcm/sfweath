Hold onto your umbrellas and brace yourselves, dear friends! Starting today, a strong atmospheric river will bring moderate to heavy rain that poses an elevated flood risk. Rain refuses to relent through Tuesday, urging a Flood Watch for the Bay Area and Central Coast by this afternoon, heightening until midweek. Oh, Чую, что скоро развергнутся хляби небесные! Expect gusty winds along the coast and elevated terrains. Stay safe and wear your scuba gear if needed! 🌧️🔍
