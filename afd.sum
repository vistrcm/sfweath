Got a fascinating weather mix for the San Francisco area! Get ready for cool winds whipping through until Monday. Expect rain and perhaps the sky-show of thunderstorms Monday and Tuesday – Чую, что скоро развергнутся хляби небесные! Important: high winds and a Gale Warning for the Big Sur coastline today. Watch out for dense fog in North Bay Valleys this morning, too.
