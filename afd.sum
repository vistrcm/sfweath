Listen up, folks. We got some weather coming our way. Starting early next week, we're gonna be in for an unsettled pattern. Temperatures will drop, clouds will roll in, and we might even see some rain and isolated thunderstorms. This is all thanks to the remnants of Tropical Cyclone Hilary passing by to the east. Inland areas of the Central Coast will see the highest chance of rain, but overall, it's still a slim chance. So don't start building that ark just yet. Keep an eye on the NWS and National Hurricane Center for updates, and stay dry out there. That's all from me for now. Stay hungry, my friends.
