There's a menacing cold front crashing through, unleashing heavy rain, gale-force winds, and even teasing with a chance for waterspouts! Scattered showers to continue today but easing off by tonight. More rains to arrive mid-week, and oh, high surf is expected late Thursday too. Чую, что скоро развергнутся хляби небесные! Hold onto your hats, my friends!
