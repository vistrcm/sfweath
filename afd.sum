Underneath the morning coastal clouds, you'll find the sun still throwing her gentle glow. Temperatures inch up for a warmer weekend. Slight marine influence for those underlining seas breathes near your norm. Tuesday, hold the drizzle. We've got clear skies and temperatures a whiff below normal--  mostly high 60s to lower 70s ringside. Prepare for breezy late afternoon winds reaching about 20 knots on the West coast.
