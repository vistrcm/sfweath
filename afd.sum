San Francisco, lay down the clam chowder spoon. Expect some smooth sailing with occasional grey cloaked mornings. Pacific's might will cool and sweep away the fog by noon from coastlines. Temperatures hanging out in the flirty 80s inland, with the coast sticking to a cautious 60s. Keep the heat on simmer; the outlook's mild, comrades.
