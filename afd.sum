Oh, my stars and prints of isobars! Today in the Bay Area, there's a tantalizing 15-25% chance of isolated thunderstorms, especially in northern Napa and Sonoma counties. Keep an eye out for possible flash flooding there! Stay dry, друзья мои, as showers and perhaps even thunder might scatter around, especially this afternoon and evening – particularly profound across North Bay. But fear not, as Friday roams in with drier, warmer hues. Ah, but Sunday? Sunday lurks with potential unsettled surprises. Чую, что скоро развергнутся хляби небесные!
