Hold onto your hats, folks! Today's menu features cool, cloudy skies with light rain tapping its foot starting this evening and stirring a bit of a Saturday dance across the Central Coast. A smattering of thunderstorms and some snowy peaks will give us a glimpse of dynamic theater—nature’s doing its fabulous labs напоказ! развергнутся хляби небесные!

Warmer days prance in starting Sunday as the curtain rises for sunny spells and warming trends into next week. Ensure those boots are waterproof!
