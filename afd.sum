Ah, my memory is tickled by anticipation of electric skies! Today brings scattered thunderstorms with gusty winds up to 45 mph across the Bay Area. Showers will continue throughout the day with rainfall possibly reaching 0.75". By tomorrow, the skies promise a brighter outlook with warmer, drier conditions. Чую, что скоро развергнутся хляби небесные!
