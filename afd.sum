Hello, weather aficionados! Our stage today is set under a nearly stationary long wave trough, lounging lazily off too far to bother us. Expect cozy marine layer stratus—cloudy blankets—hugging the coastline, along with those persistent northwesterly breezes doing a little dance over the ocean, whispering in our ears. Inland, our temperatures will play nice, staying in the double digits with no theatrical wave of rain interrupting the show...yet! But, psst, keep a sharp eye on those dry conditions; the delicate dance of nature is on a fiery edge. As day turns to night, our friendly northerly ACV-SFO pressure gradient may lend a breath to the night's cooler whisper. And with the tease of local gale force gusts between Point Reyes and Point Sur, those seas will gain some vigor.
