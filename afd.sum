Prepare for a typical February day in the Bay Area, with patchy fog in the morning and a slight chill that will feel below normal.

Come the weekend, sun-drenched days await, ready to tempt soccer balls and bicycles into action: mild temperatures, sunshine galore, and the perfect time to dig out those sunglasses! But in the near future? Чую, что скоро развергнутся хляби небесные!
