Lucky you! Below normal temperatures will persist through the week, which is perfect to fend off the autumn sunburns. There's a chance for light rain Monday through Wednesday as the marine stratus clears to reveal sunshine by afternoon today. Чую, что скоро развергнутся хляби небесные! Come Monday, we’ll see a transition with possible novelty drops and light rain beginning in the North Bay, teasing southern regions with just a sprinkle. There’s also a slight chance for showers or even a rogue thunderstorm midweek as instability climbs a bit. Stay curious and keep an umbrella handy!
