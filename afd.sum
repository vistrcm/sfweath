Rain and thunderstorms are expected from Monday to Tuesday due to an offshore upper-level low. Thunderstorms can be dangerous and could cause hail, gusty winds, and heavier downpours which increase the risk of dangerous road conditionsâ€”please take cover once you hear thunder. Expect a mix of different categories of visibility, damage to the small craft, and below-normal temperatures through to Sunday.
