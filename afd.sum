Oh boy, we're in for an interesting weekend! It's like nature has pulled out its chaotic palette for art time. Temperatures will rise with a risk of heat-related illnesses, notably in the inland regions. It's going to be quite the show with elevated fire weather in those dry, windy interior mountainsâ€”firefighters, hat and glove contest ready! Breezy onshore winds and a sneaky marine layer will play creator moods. Swells of excitement as long-period waves make the coast kacha-kacha - charming but beware of rip currents! Play safe, posse!
