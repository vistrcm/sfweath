Expect some blustery winds today, followed by a taste of sunny warmth till Friday, before a bashful wave of showers visits North Bay. The weekend, however, flirts with warmth again. Flyers, buckle up, mildly turbulent gusts are cooking, notably stout around SFO and Monterey Bay. Mariners face a stormy waltz with gale-force shows down south.
