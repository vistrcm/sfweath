Ah, what a delightful forecast we have! A period of mostly clear skies throughout the week with high temperatures in the 50s and 60s and chilly mornings in the 30s and 40s. The weather pattern is quite stable with an omega block forming, leading to boring but beautiful skies. Light offshore winds today, and all week looks calm with no grown-ups' conversation about clouds bearing rain. Looks like we're writing one of the driest January narratives. Sorry, no rain adventures this time around!
