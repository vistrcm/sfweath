Ah, a swirling dance of droplets looms over the North Bay, Santa Cruz mountains and San Mateo Peninsula. Чую, что скоро развергнутся хляби небесные! Watch out for a splash of rain today and tomorrow, and keep your eyes out for foamy surprises from the ocean as risky waters call. Keep those booties dry and your surfboards at bay till the weekend clears skies anew!
