Master Yoda from Star Wars:

Cloudy coastal weather will give way to scattered sunshine today, and there may be patchy fog and drizzle. The maximum temperature will be around 70 along the coasts and up to the upper 80s inland. Mid-week warming will bring further hotter days on Tuesday and Wednesday, and temperatures will rise to moderate heat risk levels and above by Thursday and Friday, the latter marked by light breezes and slightly cooler days. Despite a potential monsoon this week, accurate forecasts place it towards specific locations. Most of the region under stratus this morning, top-altitude terrain pockets with clear skies further nonesthetic cloudiness-specifics expected this evening. Light southerly winds are expected to cue from North Wednesday night into Tuesday mid-day the Northwest swell continues through the week with more smaller sizes approaching during the period.
