Batten down the hatches, folks! A strong atmospheric river is sweeping into North Bay starting Wednesday, with rain lasting into the weekend. Expect 3-7" of rainfall and potential flooding by late week. Gusty winds up to 40 mph could accompany it. Tuesday's your last dry day for preparations. Seas peak at 10-15 feet before subsiding early in the week but conditions will worsen again late week. Чую, что скоро развергнутся хляби небесные! Stay tuned for updates!
