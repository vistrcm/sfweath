Oh my goodness! It sounds like fog is the showstopper this morning in the Bay Area valleys. Our good old Tule Fog—that sneaky blanket—especially likes to hug the valleys causing a bit of mischief with visibility. This way, check out a 30% chance for fog in Eastern San Mateo, but a whopping 80% chance in the North and East Bay Valleys. Otherwise, it's a stubborn, clear week with characteristic chill and calm, as our ridiculously resilient ridge fends off rain until perhaps the 15th! Meanwhile, mariners might like to know of some moderately lively north winds and seas stepping soon to the surcpating stage!
