Just like stirring ingredients together for a recipe nobody asked for, wildfire smoke and northerly wind are currently muddying up Bay Area air quality. Conditions remain mostly normal - think stratus soup until mid-day like your average clam bisque starter, with temperatures creeping inland up to 80s for the main course. Fire up a precaution with that Fire Weather Watch for the North Bay Mountains, although it may just be a sizzle and not a full-on pan fire. Expect improving air quality as our menu offers a new wind dish by Friday.
