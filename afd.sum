Think fedora-wielding stranger explaining you the upcoming weather: Coming days you'll be served a chilly cocktail, featuring two swigs of cold fronts bringing overcast skies and light rain today and Tuesday afternoon. Post-Tuesday you'll get smacked with gusty winds, but upcoming fire threats are low, so — kicks up legs, smokes cigar — sit back and enjoy the cooling temperatures till next weekend when another drop of light rain shows up.
