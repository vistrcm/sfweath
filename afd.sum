Folks, enjoy your San Francisco sunrise - the annoying low cloud cover will retreat by evening. It ain't BBQ weather with temperatures dragging in slight cold but brace yourselves for the Sunday warm breeze blowin' through. Keep your sunscreen for mid week. The big boys in the sky aren't concerned with your picnic plans for now.
