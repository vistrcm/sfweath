The wind's taking a break to build some character before blowing off by afternoon. За окном безмятежность, goodbye gusty mornings. Temperatures showing some chill tonight while next week throws off a summer vibe crazy enough for both coasts and interior. Rain — Nope. Not a picture on the menu yet, light chance at the tail end of the week but amounts might just mess with your taste buds. Thunderstorms, snow, culinary disasters - foolish they are not, nothing to fret. дано буде добра погода!
