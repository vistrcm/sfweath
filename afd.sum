Okay folks, it's time to grab your umbrellas in the North Bay as light rain dances in Wednesday morning, bless its gentle heart. Hold on to your hats too, because gusty winds will tag along until Thursday, but don’t worry, they’re more playful breezes than bother. An otherwise chilly week will slowly heat up, teasing us with warmer temperatures, banishing the weekend blues with sunny skies, and temperatures flirting with warmth. Remember, as predictions are hazy beyond next Wednesday, keep an eye on those forecasts!  "Чую, что скоро развергнутся хляби небесные!"
