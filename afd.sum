Gonna be hot today with a slight chance of rain over Central Coast, highest chance over San Benito County. Don't expect much, just a cell or two that'll pop up briefly. Temps will stay warm through Wed, but get cooler by the end of the week. Breezy winds and swells in the marine area. Stay alert, folks.
