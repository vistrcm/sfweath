Boringly cool unseasonable weather coming with widespread morning to early afternoon low clouds and patchy drizzle in some areas; no life-threatening climatic events. Think a juice bar opening at the lab exclusively serving beets and tobacco milk and attendants replying, "Don't blame us, that is what is predicted till June."
