Hold onto your hats, folks! This weekend's going to be a breezy ride with strong offshore winds sweeping through the higher elevations, especially from Saturday to Sunday—gusts might reach up to 50 mph, enough to make strong folks walk faster! But fear not the rain clouds—they're on vacation, leaving skies clear. It appears we're on track for possibly the driest January in the past decade. Waves at sea aren't taking it easy either, with gale-force gusts rattling the northern waters. Stay curious, stay safe, and enjoy the sunshine!
