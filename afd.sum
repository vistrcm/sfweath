Get ready for some serious cloud excitement! A beefier marine layer today means cooler weather and even a touch of morning drizzle in the Bay Area. Чую, что скоро развергнутся хляби небесные! Hold on to your hats! Strong northwest winds Thursday and Friday, with a chance of offshore winds and a bit of a warm-up. Keep an eye out for gusty marine conditions too—expected waves and expanding windiness. Stay curious, everyone!
