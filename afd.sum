Hello curious weather enthusiasts! We have a fascinating week ahead near San Francisco â€“ cool temperatures persist, thanks to the stubborn trough pattern offshore and a generous marine layer. Breezy afternoons add a dash of delightful drama. Marine lovers: beware, gusty conditions may ruffle small crafts! But alas, no rain forecasted, so keep your umbrellas tucked away for now.
