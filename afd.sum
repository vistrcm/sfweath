Under blue stretch of California skies, westwards towards San Francisco expect sun-filled days with 70sand 80s warmth pouring inland, while a little ocean whisper will keep coastal kids cool in the60s. Low threats rock the boat at "Small Craft Advisory" across the day from Pt Arena to Pt Reyes. Enjoy, and stay safe, comrades.
