Brr, a chilly start for the Bay Area today! Expect rain, especially in the North Bay, with heavier showers late afternoon and evening as a cold front moves in. Temps are 5-15 degrees below average. Чую, что скоро развергнутся хляби небесные! Another storm brings more rain and gusty winds Friday into Saturday. Stay dry!
