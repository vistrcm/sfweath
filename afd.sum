Weather's throwing a slight curveball on the West Coast today folks - noticeably cooler temperatures, caused by low pressure sliding down from the Northwest, inspiring shades of Autumn. Don't rely on sunshine to combat the chill, the cloud covering could cause a little drizzle, especially up North Bay way. Stay tuned for a slight warm-up charge coming mid-week. Weather's definitely got soul today.
