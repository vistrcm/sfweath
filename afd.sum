Alright folks, here’s the lowdown! Today you might see some lingering clouds and a sprinkle here or there, particularly in the North Bay and Central Coast, but by afternoon, expect clearer skies and temperatures a bit warmer than yesterday. Heads up: a heatwave is sneaking in Tuesday with temps soaring 8-14 degrees above normal inland. Cooler days ahead late next week. 

Over in the marine zone, we’ve got hefty northwesterly breezes sticking around and expect seas to get a bit choppier especially by Tuesday.

Чую, что скоро развергнутся хляби небесные! Only a sprinkle, but clear skies will soon follow.

Stay curious and keep lookin’ up!
