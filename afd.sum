Today is going to be cloudy. You might even need an umbrella because it's going to drizzle a bit. Temps will range from the upper 50s to mid-60s near the coast, with low to upper 70s inland. Drier conditions expected during the week, and it will be getting warmer, especially in californian interiors. Confused? Me no either.
