Today in San Francisco, you're looking at average high temperatures with those lovely seasonal breezy winds. Catch a break from the heat as a slight cooling trend starts rolling in around Friday, sticking around until next week. Now pay attention, there might be some drizzle through the night and into the morning, mainly along our beautiful coast. Enjoy!
