San Francisco, buckle up for a rowdy evening sweating through heavy rainfall till Monday. High chances of added side dish storms and mighty gusty winds wrapping around your evenings. Just pointing out the fact - rain's coming back Wednesday, quietly though. Dry, warmer climate stepping in by week's end. Prep those umbrellas for the dance!
