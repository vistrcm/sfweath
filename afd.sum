Enjoy a calm culinary week chaps, as high pressure descends. Bit of mid-week drizzle to attend to and a weekend soused with slightly heavier servings. Mostly cozy temperatures while the mysterious fog acts like an unfriendly maitre d' in certain patches. Secure your boats though, choppy waters and stronger winds are brewing on Tuesday!
