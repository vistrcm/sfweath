Whoa! Today promises to be warm and dry, but buckle up for tomorrow, my friends, for an unsettled weather pattern is cueing up for a grand entrance! Moderate rain, strong southerly winds, even a slight chance of thunderstorms late Wednesday till Thursday, as the heavens are on the verge of unleashing their mighty powers. Чую, что скоро развергнутся хляби небесные! Winds may gust up to 60 mph, with rain promising up to 3 inches in some coastal ranges. A breeze for Tuesday, a storm for Wednesday—nature writes theatrical plays, doesn't it? Stay safe and grab an umbrella, for the mighty winds will also bring rain galore!
