Batten down the hatches, Bay Area dwellers. Listen up: red flag warnings and gusty, dry offshore winds are cooking up from today lasting into Sunday - a recipe for critical fire weather conditions. It's also gonna chill down to sinking lows tonight with scattered shots of freezing temperatures in far southern Monterey County. Light rain? Maybe. But only give it a shot by the end of next week. Stay safe, peeps. Don't light any outdoor fires.
