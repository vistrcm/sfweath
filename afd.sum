Get ready for some unsettled weather in the North Bay today, with showers possible but not guaranteed to surprise you with an umbrella requirement. A smattering of clouds and cooler temperatures will dominate the scene. Чую, что скоро развергнутся хляби небесные! Conditions should dry up and warm somewhat by Friday. Don't forget your gusty hats—Northwest winds will be moderate to feisty across marine zones starting today, brewing rough sea adventures come Friday.
