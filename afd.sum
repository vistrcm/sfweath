Light rain is tiptoeing our way again today, pal, with a second cold front to blame. Not gone raise a great song and dance about it though - highest totals maxing out at two-tenths of an inch topside North Bay. We're knuckling down for a gorgeous dry spell before the bragged-about rain rollicks in again for the weekend.
