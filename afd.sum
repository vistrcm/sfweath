Y’all better break out the jackets because it’s getting cooler this week! The West Coast is gonna feel the wrath of a trough (whatever that is) with patchy drizzle and clouds headin’ our way. The Bay Area and Central Coast got a low chance of getting any serious convection going on (I’m not even sure what that means either).
