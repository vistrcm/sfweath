Buckle up, folks! We've got gusty winds reaching up to 50 mph along the coast, elevated fire weather conditions inland due to dry grass, and dangerously rough seas lingering through midweek. Heat risks midweek give way to cooler temperatures approaching the weekend. No rain is expected, so keep your sun hats handy!
