Get ready for a weather roller coaster, folks! Today will be warm but brace yourself for a major cool down by Tuesday. Winds will pick up, reaching 20-30 mph. No rain yet, but skies will be cloudy, and temperatures will tumble. If youâ€™re near the coast, expect fog to stick around like stubborn bubblegum!

Watch out for strong winds and take it easy.
