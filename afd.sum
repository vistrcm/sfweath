San Francisco is getting a touch of rain, a nick or two on the kitchen blade. Expect less than 0.2" through the day - drizzles, really. Be warned of dense fog surprising you like an uninvited health inspector in Sonoma County. The rain stops by evening itself, while nights may bite with cold. Neck-saving warming trend begins next week.
