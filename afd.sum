Bust out those sunglasses and enjoy a sunny, toasty weekend around San Fran, folks. Highs in the 70s - as tasty as the perfect gazpacho. But come Sunday, brace for the culinary chaos equivalent - unpredictable stormy sugar knocking at your door. Wannabe thunderstorms, rainfall, and gutsy winds of 30+ knots coming for a week-long visit and perhaps overstaying a tad through Thursday. Now, dig into the weekend, but brace for a sour dessert.
