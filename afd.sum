Alright folks, simmer in some sun-soaked silence today and Tuesday - weather's cookin' up a quiet dish, topping at a savory 65 at toasty 75. Changing the recipe from Wednesday: get ready to feel a colder breeze before those heavenly faucets untwist, dancing us through a tune of light onshore winds, chills in the air, and the grand spectacle of fresh шлеби небесные from Thursday to Friday. Expect a cool and moist kick-off for April.
