Hey folks, listen up! We've got a cooler Saturday on the list with a delightful rise in temperatures coming your way on Sunday and Monday; however, watch out for Minor HeatRisk. Patchy stratus graces the coast this weekend. Oh, there's wind in the mix too, especially strong ones out at sea! Make sure to wear gifts from cooling land like hats when it warms up! Don't skip your drinks, I’m not talking alcohol, mind you, but watery goodness! And for those on the waters, hold tight as gusty ≥ gale winds paint today’s experience! Stay curious and prepared!
