Ah, what a whimsical dance in the atmosphere today around the Bay Area! Clouds have a starring role early on, draping the sky with a generous layer of stratus, treating us to the tiniest kisses of drizzle—tune numbers ranging from 0.01" to 0.07", very subtle! Чую, что скоро развергнутся хляби небесные... though this damp serenade tapers off as the day waltzes along. The weekend is ready to bring a charming warm-up under a budding ridging pattern. Expect a whimsical whirl of breezy offshore winds over the inland mountains as we head into Friday and Saturday mornings—I promise you they're low-key gusts, nothing uprooting your garden gnomes. By day’s end, the forecast promises mild and quiet entrancements with temperatures flirting around their seasonal norms.
