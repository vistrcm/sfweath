Expect an appetizer of rain whipped up from San Francisco to Central Coast, served throughout the day and thinning a little by Thursday. Brace yourself for gusty winds over 45 mph hitting Santa Lucia Mountains & Los Padres National Forest. Pockets of thunderstorms may add spice. Things mellow out mid-week with a drier, colder entr√©e to follow.
