Precipitation is dressing down in the SF Bay Area today but watch out for leftover lingering nuisances on roads,/sidebar with nods of small landslides. Rain will make a comeback Tuesday into Wednesday but then cedes the scene to dry, mild conditions for the weekend. Santa, fasten your sun hat because upper temps are strolling towards foreplay territory by then.
