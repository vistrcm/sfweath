Right, folks, buckle up for a curious ride! We’ve got sprinkles or light rain today, coupled with cooler air sweeping in across the Bay Area. Minor high tide flooding might splash up in some coastal areas through Thursday. Keep an eye out for SW gusty winds up to 40 mph in certain spots initially.

Чую, что скоро развергнутся хляби небесные! Stay curious, cloud gazers!
