Ah, what a lovely choreography of Mother Nature we have unfolding here! As our chilly friend, the cold front, departs, the rain takes a bow but be ready for clear skies and a brisk, cold weekend! Brrr! Cold mornings will dance in, possibly twirling into near-record low temperatures. However, just as Wildebeests prepare for the storm, another significant event with joyous raindrops will return mid-week. Чую, что скоро развергнутся хляби небесные! Be on guard: sonorous gusts will persist from Saturday, stirring waters in moderate to rough waves, with creek flooding remaining a concern today.
