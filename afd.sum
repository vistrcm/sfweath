Seems like good ol' Frisco is in for quite an unplanned dinner guest! Brace yourself for unsolicited poundings of rain and her cousin thunderstorms bringing along hail-sized business cards, droves of them. A basement-deep pressure is kicking up brief blizzards over high terrains too – snowflakes are gatecrashing under 3000 feet as we speak. So підготуйтеся до бою, my friends, it's gonna be a rough service today!
