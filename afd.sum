Alright folks, get this - over in San Francisco, temperatures are pretty much sticking to their usual gig. But wait, there's a puny - really puny - chance of unnaturally high convection and some Tim Burton-style lightning, especially down south. Word of advice, keep an eye up top - we may witness a late-night lightning show over the Bay Area and North Bay. Tweaking into Tuesday and we're all getting subtly cooler. Get ready to brace some sea fog with your coastal breakfast and marine disturbances for the mid-week sails. And remember, Морський вітер принесе ці капелюхи - get your sails down before you face the squalls. Safe rides, people!
