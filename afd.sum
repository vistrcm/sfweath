Deep marine layer making clouds play hide and seek, with the caped crusaders making appearances mostly in the night and morning. Slightly less sizzle for today with temperatures going soft before regaining their bite over the weekend and into next week. A shift in pattern, ushering in unusual warmth- bringing those above-normal numbers. Somewhere between uncomfortably warm and refinely pleasant. Grease up folks, itâ€™s getting bumpy.
