Damn, brother, prepare for the sweating инферно! This heat wave doesn't feel like shaking off our shoulders, soaring us with triple digit temperatures, kissing places like Santa Rosa and Livermore with fiery 106 degrees. Пожарная безопасность is the talk of the town, Red Flag Warnings knuckles and wouldn't leave till modochna. Cooler heads will likely prevail next week, so survive, friends.
