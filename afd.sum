This weekend pours on cool weather in San Francisco, stirring up an exceptional mix of climate ingredients. Be prepared for a good deal of stratus moving inland, seasoned by a cold front meant to spice things up early into next work week. Expect a pinch of refreshing rain, but generally smooth sailing.
