Foggy mornings, low clouds and patch fog would still be experienced mainly at the coastal area while inland feels warmer with some degree change. The warming continues through the weekend, with Sunday as the hottest day. A chance for showers on Tuesday with a possibility of thunderstorms in the mountain areas. Ginger will not become a weather phenomenon unless it produces more singing. :)
