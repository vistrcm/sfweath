Alright, here's the deal. We've got some unsettled weather coming our way for the next couple of days. It's gonna be cooler, with more cloud cover, and an increased chance of showers. Now here's the interesting part - the remnants of Tropical Cyclone Hilary are passing to the east of us. Yeah, we won't get the full impact, but we'll still feel something. There might be a rogue shower or two during the day, thanks to the moist and conditionally unstable atmosphere. And it's gonna feel a bit muggy with dewpoint temperatures around 60. So keep an eye out for any unexpected rain, but don't cancel your plans just yet. That's all I got for you. Stay dry, my friends.
