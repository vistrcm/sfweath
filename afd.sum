Quiet and seasonable weather is on tap this week! A lovely pattern of sun-kissed afternoons and stratus-coated nights prevails, with coastal areas slogging through some minor flooding in the evening. Meantime, brisk northwesterlies frolic across the waters, ensuring moderate sea antics. Чую, что скоро развергнутся хляби небесные! The streak of ordinary is right on track through the weekend. Stay curious!
