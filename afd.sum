Greetings, earthlings! Checking the weather forecast today declares: High winds are spinning the dance of nature across the Bay Area with gusts up to a whopping 50 mph through Sunday morning. Чую, что скоро развергнутся хляби небесные! Rain is taking a short curtain call with isolated light drizzle. On the horizon, fierce offshore winds love playing a game with our nerves on late Sunday into Monday, increasing garden-variety fire weather risks, later turning more relaxed and bringing back our cuddly sunny afternoons next week. Oh, and surf's up with waves reaching fierce heights along the coastline – ride at your own risk! Secure the deck chairs, my friends, chaos commences!
