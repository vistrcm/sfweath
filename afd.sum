Light rain is gently caressing the Bay Area this morning with more expected on Sunday. Beware of large swells; they're creating hazardous beach conditions throughout the weekend as waves might unexpectedly rise high. There's a pleasing trend of warming and drying up next week! Чую, что скоро развергнутся хляби небесные!
