Heads up, Bay Area! Scattered showers today with potential thunderstorms later - especially around Monterey. Winds will pick up, getting quite gusty this afternoon. As for Tuesday and onward, brace yourselves for more rain continuously. And oh, stay away from the beach - dangerous wave conditions expected. Чую, что скоро развергнутся хляби небесные! Stay safe!
