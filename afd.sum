Strap in, folks, Mother Nature's cranked up the heat in the Bay Area and Central Coast during this Tuesday to Thursday. Offshore flows and high pressure friends colluding for scorching highs of 80s to mid-90s, just slap on an extra warning with hazardous marine conditions sprinkling in sneaky waves, and high surf. Jackpot - a dense fog advisory for the Monterey Bay and the north Salinas Valley. Not your regular picnic at the beach.
