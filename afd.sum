Hold onto your hats and stay away from the coast! A Tsunami Advisory is in effect due to an 8.8 earthquake off Russia's coast. Inland areas enjoy sunshine and slightly warm, breezy conditions, but the coastline remains besieged by low stratus clouds. Remember, you're not in a movie, avoid the water and stay safe as this isn't just one wave, but a series of potentially severe ones. Be cautious and wise, my friends!
