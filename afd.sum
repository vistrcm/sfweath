Be ready for a raw deal folks - today the heavens'll throw everything they've got at us, snow at high elevations and rain coming 그отАцо off and on throughout the day. And then once more, from Monday through Wednesday, yet same ragout - lighter, yes, but definitely not dryer. A light show is also on the menu for Wednesday so expect some atmospheric pyrotechnics thrown in for good measure as a potential mastiff of a storm descends. Piercing northerlies on Wednesday wrap up this culinary tempest before the thermostat edges up, landing us back to maybe sweater but no jacket weather levels come Thursday. Safe travel waving in your face to the sailors among ya, not before punctuating today with fresh waterspouts a-scrollin'. Might want to consider the scenic route, everyone. Safe spins.
