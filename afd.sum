Alright folks, we're gonna face pair of cold fronts tossing light showers and tossing the dice with a slim chance of thunder in the mix today in the Bay Area. Freeze your socks off on clear, high-wind Tuesday leading to cold wake-ups on Wed-Thu. Hang on though, the rain's back on Friday booking it for another dry weekend.
