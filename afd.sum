Ah, boy! Today’s a hot one with temps hitting 95-105 degrees inland. Near the coast, expect anywhere from upper 60s to mid-80s. Keep that water handy; a Heat Advisory is in place until 8 PM. Coastal areas might see some dense fog, especially along Hwy 1. 

Fire risks stay high with extremely low humidity, but there’s some good news: winds aren’t too strong. Relief is on the way starting Saturday with significant cooling, falling back to near seasonal averages by Sunday.

Later next week, clouds may gather over North Bay, raising hopes for a sprinkle, but nothing’s set yet. Hang in there!

For those at the Monterey or near the coast, tricky marine layers might increase fog—but expect afternoon clearing. 

Critical fire weather persists, so stay alert!

And guess what? Maritime activities will see moderate seas and moderate breezy winds. Local gusts near Big Sur too!

Stay safe, hydrated, and keep an eye
