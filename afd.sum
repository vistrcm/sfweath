Watch out, North Bay! A Red Flag Warning - that's fire talk - is in effect through tonight. Gusty winds, high heat, and parched conditions up the risk for wildfires. High peaks are flirting with digits in the 100s, while inland is cozying in the 80s and 90s, and coastal areas â€™bout ready to simmer down to 60s-70s. Come Thursday, expect cooler temps and possibly some drizzle.
