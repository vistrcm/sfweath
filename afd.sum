Looks like the high pressure is playing the boss, bringing in some calm weather and slowly spiking the temperature for the week. Beware, my bay area friends, she's whistling some mighty onshore winds. The winds are tickling the coast, but making a breezier gig elsewhere–40mph gusts ain’t no joke. Good news for the sun-seekers, you’ll be soaking in that great ball of fire in the afternoon away from the populated highway of clouds. By midweek, get ready to feel the summer's hot kiss reach 80 degrees inland while the coast holds steady. In short, a broiling pot of weather bustling this week: warm, windy, and gloriously sunny. All aboard!
