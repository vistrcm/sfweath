Hey there's going to be chilly showers hitting the Bay Area and Central Coast, so take out your rain boots and umbrellas. Чую, что скоро развергнутся хляби небесные! Also prepped are a few thunderstorms on the menu with the peaks serving a mix of snow/rain. If you've got outdoor plans, a heads up so you are ready when the thunder roars! Midweek you might enjoy some sunshine before it pours again towards the weekend. As for sailing folks, Sunday warns of gale and rising wave heights but lower winds and water cool off should start by the fresh week. как говорится, ветреная халява поднимает волны!
