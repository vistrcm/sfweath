Alrighty, folks! Fasten your thinking caps! So, we've had an upper-level disturbance take a little trip near the California/Oregon border, shaking things up just enough to compress that marine layer to about 500 feet. But as the week unwinds, we'll see high pressure cozying in, bringing warmth and dryness — crank up the heat midweek!

Outdoor wanderers, keep an eye on fire safety and pack those hiking essentials. And beachgoers, beware those ocean waves and chilly waters!

Now for the grand finale: By the weekend, expect a slight cool-down. Just a nudge, not a murmur of mad moisture or rogue thunderstorms — yet. Stay tuned, observer extraordinaires!
