Hold onto your hats! Gusty winds and fire weather concerns are the highlights today with winds roaring up to a fierce 45 mph in spots. Those sailing the seas should be cautious of turbulent waves and gusty conditions. But at least, the skies are clear, and the weather stays dry, minus any raindrops in sight! Just think of it as nature amping up the intensity for the encore of astronomical summer.
