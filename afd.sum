I can summarize this weather area discussion report. Temperatures will drop from previous days and expect cooler air flowing from the sea for coastal populations. High pressure over the Desert SW causes warming towards mid-week in inland areas. LIFR/LFR (Indicates less than the three-mile visibility other than precipitation phenomena) affects Monterey Bay for most of the night. There is a dense fog advisory on Monterey Bay coastline and San Francisco Peninsula coastline for Sunday morning. The weather report outlook is favorable as little to no hazards or disruptions are problematic. Fairly good weather conditions towards Monday through Thursday, but with pockets of cluttered hill stations with some cumulus clouds.
