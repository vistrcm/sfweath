Lingering showers are on their way out in southern Monterey County, giving way to sunlight and warm winds. Fog is playing peekaboo along the coast, expecting to roll out by late morning. Radiator-hot temperatures further inland with chillier readings sticking to the coast, just like a good kitchen balancing heat disparities. Looking ahead, slightly cooler weather expected, but still reasonably arid, with another heat couturi√®re on the horizon. Get ready, and stay hydrated. Stay safe.
