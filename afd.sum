So, what do we have here? Shower fun on the Central Coast is spreading north, aiming to give the Bay Area a soggy surprise, but thunderstorms could only muster dry drama. Tricksy! Windy thunderstorms may gust up spirits, possibly igniting wildfires, thus adding chaos to our pending precipitation! Чую, что скоро развергнутся хляби небесные! Expect a warm feature this Friday but stay tuned as another rainier revival looms next week.  Atmospheric smorgasbord, so pack an umbrella! 
Stay curious and care for your hats if visiting those gales offshore.
