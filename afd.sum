Hold on to your hats folks! Today, you'll need to keep an eye on scattered showers and possible thunderstorms in the morning, alongside a chill that'll make you shiver like a cold atom experiment gone rogue. Expect strong breezes and even snow in high places! Another storm system is marching its way here by Friday, promising more rain. Чую, что скоро развергнутся хляби небесные!
