Expect the creep of dense fog through the North Bay and East Bay valleys until 11 AM, followed by a main course of widespread rain late this afternoon. Last night's leftovers, showers and thunderstorms, will linger till Wednesday morning. Then briefly dry Thursday before unsettled weather opens up for the weekend encore. High Surf Advisory is in place. Stay safe, folks.
