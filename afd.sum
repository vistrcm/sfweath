Well, my friend, today's menu offers warmth with light winds—most folks would like to have seconds of this weather over so many dishes! Drizzle in some coastal spots, tranquil elsewhere with delightful highs pushing into the upper 70s, lower 80s through Sunday. Expect scalable breezes soul-tripping beneath the springtime sun over the weekend. Vessels, tighten your sails! Coastal winds promise theme park worthy rides south of Point Sur; pizazz in packs, forklifting wave-induced miles amidst bumpy seas—ahoy on small crafts at gale-like gestures. Rain shall refrain from dousing daily joy-logs near elegant Estrada—astounding predictions waive impending drops. Lookup delighted sun-caught smile, fog clears your breezy path!
