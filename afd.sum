Looking outside in San Francisco, we've got some moody weather fitting for a Kerouac novel brewing. I hear the pitter-patter, "Чую, что скоро развергнутся хляби небесные!" Rough translation? Umbrellas out, folks, the heavenly faucets are opening up this afternoon. Get ready for rain showers and a dusting of unruly gusts, speeding around 25-30 mph. Frosty cocktails in central coast might risk a soaking too with lighter amounts later today. Nothing to knock you out really, but enough to remind us all we're alive, that it's a day in the city. 

Forget about cooking late night. We got more shenanigans arriving overnight; scattered showers, the stray lightning due for an encore. Again, nothing to sweat too much over, just a soupy mix. Dress for cold weather, dizzying in low 30s to exhilarating 60-ish.
