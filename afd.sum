Rain on its way today, hitting Monterey and San Benito counties with a heavy splash! Bay Area, gird your umbrellas for later as the splash travels north. Sunday promises gusty winds, possibly uprooting some tired trees. Remember, avoiding the road puddles keeps your feet dry and your car afloat. "Чую, что скоро развергнутся хляби небесные!" Thunderstorms might jazz up the Sunday music, with the vibe dropping real cool as we head into next week.
