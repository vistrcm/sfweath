Ah, the dance of the weather! Today brings light rain mainly to the North Bay, but tomorrow, get those umbrellas ready! A cold front with heavier rain and strong winds will sweep in Sunday morning. Чую, что скоро развергнутся хляби небесные! After, clear skies and chilly mornings settle in next week; perhaps winter is finally showing us her cool shoulder! Dense fog sits on its throne this morning along Monterey Bay, so watch the road. The grand surf remains high, so gaze at a respectful distance—don’t let Poseidon swipe you!
