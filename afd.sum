Hot days ahead inland, cooling down gradually by Sunday. Expect fog, mist, and morning drizzle along the coast. Breezy onshore winds, gusting up to 30 mph in some valleys. Seas roughen with strengthening northwest breezes. Flight conditions generally foggy tonight and mornings. Чую, что скоро развергнутся хляби небесные со стланской долины!
