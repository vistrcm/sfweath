It's a drizzle-fest over in North Bay, but it's barely getting the sidewalks wet. Those clouds are sticking around like last nightâ€™s smoke in a dive bar. With another chance of rain come Monday, expect similar menus of coastal breeze and mildly disappointing get-togethers with the sun. San Francisco, brace for a heat wave, with temps flirting with the 90s later in the week.
