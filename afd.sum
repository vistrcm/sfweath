Brace yourselves for frosty mornings through the holiday weekend, with temperatures potentially dipping to 30 degrees in some areas. Keep an eye out for fog in Sonoma County's interior valleys, mostly clearing by midday. Cheer up, though; the afternoons should warm up nicely with sunny skies and temperatures reaching the mid to upper 60s. Beyond that, there's a hint of rain coming into the scene towards late next week, though uncertainty still swirls around it like frost on a winter morning. So enjoy the tranquility while it lasts!
