Ah, the beauty of stationary high-pressure systems! No rain this time, folks, so save your umbrellas - only benign celestial wonders persist through the week. Caution is advised around Tule fog in North Bay and East Bay Valleys, offering an enticing, yet temporary, dance of reduced visibility. Up in the sky, fresh northwesterly winds waltz their way through next week's seas, convincing them to whip up moderate swells, before revealing a grand new swell show mid-week. It's all quite the meteorological performance! Enjoy your day and may you glide safely, even as "No Fallen Skies" refuses a bow this time.
