Today, in San Fran, soak up in sun. Starting from late Monday, a 'storm' is pogosticking your way through the week with chances of full-blown rains and timid thunderstorms from Wednesday or Thursday to wet your 'quesadillas'. Brace for possible rainfall up to 2-3 inches, and don't expect things to dry up any quicker than Friday. Enjoy the show!
