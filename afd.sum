Ah, well, well, looky here! High stakes are not on the forecast today as no significant weather rolls through. We're dancing around average temperatures with a slight cooling conclusion anticipated later next week. A refreshing breeze graces the afternoons, with clarified skies chasing morning clouds away from inland spots, thanks to a lively onshore wind. Coastal areas remain cozy with cool highs ranging from the upper 50s to mid 60s. Meanwhile, sailors should keep tab on building winds and rough seas by mid-week, but otherwise, we've got smooth sailing on this spaceship Earth! No celestial tears forecasted today, folks! Do stay curious!
