Watch out for some pretty heated days on Thursday and Friday, with a Heat Advisory for interior regions, and moderate fire weather risk as the temperatures climb into the low 100s in some spots. Few patches of fog possibly lurking around seasoned minds seeking coolness, but coastal winds shall grant some respite! The moisture is coming Friday into Saturday, and it's bound to make you think "Hmm, it's a bit muggy today." However, donâ€™t be fooled by journeys of droplets, there's yet no solid sign of rain, rest easy!
