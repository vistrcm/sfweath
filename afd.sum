Ah, a tale of two temperatures and sneaky seas! The weather is warming with some offshore winds, notably dry, but there is dense fog lingering to picnic on patience driving through North Bay Valleys. No rain this time, just a sprinkle of fog whispering its departure as day warms. Watch out for those sly sneaker waves and pesky rip currents along the Pacific coast this weekend; the ocean's a capricious composer!
