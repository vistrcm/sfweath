Alright folks, here's the scoop for San Francisco and nearby areas!

We've got hot and dry conditions sticking around through Friday with a noticeable HeatRisk. A major cool-down starts Saturday with more pleasant weather kicking in next week. 

Expect patchy fog and even a bit of coastal drizzle for those early morning drives today. Interior regions—watch out: near-critical fire weather persists due to lack of good humidity recoveries.

Friday, there's a slight chance we could see isolated thunderstorms—so be prepared but don't hold your breath. But next week, we could gingerly welcome the return of a low-pressure system with a shot at rain in the North Bay.

Stay cool and cautious everyone, don’t let the heat or fog catch you off guard!
