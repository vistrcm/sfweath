Hold onto your hats, folks! Today's going to sizzle as a Heat Advisory continues until 9 PM with temperatures even hotter than yesterday. Over the weekend, temps look to ease off slowly. As for clouds, some high and mid-level fluff this afternoon; with a better shot at IFR stratus making an appearance Thursday morning.

Expect gusty NW winds at sea but they will calm a bit before picking back up this weekend. 

If you're in those warned areas, shade and water are your best friends today! ðŸŒž
