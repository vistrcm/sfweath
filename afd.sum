Hold onto your hats, folks! We're entering a period of gusty winds and high fire danger until Saturday, with offshore gusts up to 65 mph in favored spots. Keep those matches hidden while wildfire risks stay elevated. Drink your morning coffee before it's lost to the wind, and expect some locally dense fog until 10 AM. Чую, что ветряная палочка чревата! Keep safe, and remember the wind is relentless.
