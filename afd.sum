Listen up! We got a bit of a forecast for you: a warming spree into the weekend is bound to heat up those inland areas, with potential temps hitting 100-102F. Soupy skies give way as compressed marine layers swoop into sea level. As quanta cool to hindquarters—higher atmospheric pressure nudges in, bringing possible rough and tumble conditions in the sea! Балласта отсекали вокруг полуостровов!

It won't rain, so no opening of the heavens in sight this time, comrades! 

Stay hydrated 'cause heat likes to take its toll, huh.
