Buckle up, adventurous souls of the Bay Area and Central Coast, rain showers spatter us today, clearing by evening just in time for trick-or-treating chills. But fear not, for tomorrow Чую, что скоро развергнутся хляби небесные! More substantial rains and even a thunderstorm chance return Friday into Saturday. And mind you, the wicked winds later might spark a fiery tango with fire season not yet over. Stay safe and prepare wisely!
