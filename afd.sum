Ah, what an interesting weather week for you folks in the San Francisco area! Today might feel like a teaser for spring, with mild temperatures peeking their heads above the normal levels. There could be some faint morning showers in the North Bay but expect just a trace amount—barely worth a drop. As the week unfolds, these sneaky clouds will scatter away, leaving warmer-than-usual temperatures by midweek with highs up to 15 degrees more than the norm! Yet, be cautiously optimistic: by next weekend, there's a tantalizing hint of a rainy curtain call, with prospects for wider rainfall. "Чую, что скоро развергнутся хляби небесные!" For now, enjoy the warmth and keep a weather-eye on the horizon!
