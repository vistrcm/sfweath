Fog in the morning and sunshine later on with isolated shower days across Central Coast. Cool sometime with the span of several days which may give some isolated patchy drizzles over the weekend stretching down the week. No significant event such as storm or heavy precipitations are anticipated. If it does rain it is likely to be negligible. Aviation will be moderate to breezy or indirectly the excerpt basically is meteorologist's good talk speaking to windsocks. Mariners are advised to expect work week breeziness amidst mixed swells, so don't forget important scars!
