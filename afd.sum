Rain is returning to the Bay Area today with light showers and drizzle expected, especially in the North Bay—Чую, что скоро развергнутся хляби небесные! Temperatures will drop well below seasonal averages due to a cold front, and gusty winds reaching over 30 mph are likely, particularly in mountain areas. As we sway into colder temps, grab a sweater, as Monday and Tuesday morning will feel particularly chilly with wind chills. Look out for more chances of rain and thunderstorms through the week! So, quite the frolic of cold, rain, and a bit of wind dance ahead!
