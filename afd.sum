Well, folks, it looks like we're in for some classic California weather! Apart from some patchy fog—especially dense around Monterey Bay—conditions will remain dry and mostly clear as high pressure dominates. Expect warming temperatures and gusty offshore winds, but watch out for fog causing driving complications in spots this morning. Take it all in, a solar physics show without a cloud in sight—a rare occurrence in February!
