Oh, folks in the San Francisco area, looks like the heavens have a plan for you! ☂️ Slightly warmer today, but hold your horses, rain's making a comeback by Wednesday morning. Freezing temperatures will creep into the valleys tonight, so brace yourselves! Expect round after round of mostly light rain ahead in the rest of the week, and mother nature’s getting waves rough and exciting on the coast. Чую, что скоро развергнутся хляби небесные!
