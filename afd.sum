Ah, my curious friends! Today, it's all about a warming trend gripping the region until Tuesday with drizzle lurking in some coastal corners. Come Wednesday, rain showers tiptoe in, surely exclaiming, "Чую, что скоро развергнутся хляби небесные!" Last week's stormy signatures wave goodbye, while a new upper-level trough twirls in to bring more rain potential. Weekly sunshine rates begin to tally up by Friday - a reminder to fasten your umbrellas, North Bay wanderers, lest Wednesday's resurgence prank you wet!  Keep an eye out for hazardous winds stirring the seas southern of Point Sur on Monday. Stay sharp, and hey, remember to have those raincoats pressed and ready!
