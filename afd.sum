Oh, look at that! It's a delightful symphony of warmth and offshore winds marching through the Bay Area curtain midweek, teasing with temperatures dancing around 5-10 degrees above the average! Yet, our party takes a twist as unsettled weather plans a surprise entrance later in the week with a possibility of rain by Friday. Чую, что скоро развергнутся хляби небесные! Keep in mind, higher elevations will play conductor with moderate winds today and Tuesday. Always a theatrical show, this weather!
