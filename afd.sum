Here's what we're looking at:

It’ll be toasty for the foreseeable future; temperatures are running a bit higher than usual. And the skies are plotting something sneaky! We might see some dry lightning Friday evening into Saturday, fueled by gobs of monsoonal moisture drifting in.

For today, expect warmer weather, some high clouds hovering around, and possibly less morning marine layer fog since there’s a bit more of a mix going on.

Oh, and a heads up –stratus clouds delight this morning and again by this evening, with breezy onshore winds whipping up by the afternoon, throwing around some punchy gusts particularly by the coast.

Чую, что скоро развергнутся хляби небесные! Unleashing any thunderstorms? Quite possibly a low one!

Flying? The clouds might shake things up, obfuscating the route particularly early or late in the day.

Gale warning mariners? More like heads-up alerts. Expect fresh gusts,
