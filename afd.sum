Get ready, folks, because here comes a drenching! The North Bay is seeing rain today, gradually spreading south with intense showers expected along the Sonoma and Marin coastal areas. There's potential flooding, especially in the North Bay. So, (cue ominous voice) prepare for flooding and make necessary arrangements. Saturday remains wet, with even heavier rains heading into next week. Небеса разверзаются и купаются во мокячестве!
