Oh, what an atmospheric adventure we're in for! With scattered showers flirting along the coast today, don't get too comfy just yet—another drizzly guest is arriving tonight into Wednesday with more rainfall sprinkled throughout! Чую, что скоро развергнутся хляби небесные! After all these water antics, expect a slight warm-up and dryness from Thursday onwards, with potential offshore winds this weekend. Stay cozy!
