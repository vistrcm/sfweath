Keep your shades handy, folks, 'cause the sun will be smiling down on us this whole week. Brace for an early season sneak peek of high heat in central zones – think mid 80s – just enough to make folks sweat a bit. But fair warning: with the heat believers will want to swath in light fabrics with bottles of spring water in tow. To my friends along the coast, spicy gusts of up to 30mph will be rolling in – and San Fran condition holds its own forte. Bottom line, this calls for days best spent outdoors. Just mind the seagulls.
