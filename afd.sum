We're feeling the heat y'all in California! Push through another Melba toast-toasting day today and cool down with a spritz of drizzle by Sunday. Watch out for wild, gusty winds whipping up to 35 mph and keep eyes peeled on those tenders for flare-ups - we got real fire concerns. Translation: elevated temperatures – heat up, briefly cool, use a drink coaster on Sunday. Fire risk is real, njut with winds up to, damn - 35 mph! Keeps this Oakland graze under control, will ya, Mother Nature? On that note Dockers, it ain't rain yet. Very ‘po novomy’, yet, again warm next week. We carry on!
