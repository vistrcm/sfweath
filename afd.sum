Well folks, here's the forecast: cool temperatures through midweek, then above average temps by the weekend. Watch out for some drizzle along the coast and the Bay, while inland areas will heat up to the 90s. On the marine side, expect moderate northwesterly flow and some advisory for small craft. Stay safe out there!
