Ah, delightful weather on the horizon! Bask in chilly mornings and mild days until Thursday, but mind that coastal fog. Come Friday, a wet weekend awaits especially in the North Bay, with rain drenching the weekend. Чую, что скоро развергнутся хляби небесные! Expect these stratus leaden struggles as stubborn clouds oscillate through our days, while at night the mercury falls—the Frost may sting again.
