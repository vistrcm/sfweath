Dry skies reign supreme with chilly starts and sunny afternoons, sans rain. A brush of frosting may occur in the mornings, with some areas flirting with frost advisories. Windy pockets linger in higher elevations but sunshine galore prevails. So, no "Чую, что скоро развергнутся хляби небесные!" for now, just a minor bluster and that chill in the air. Gale warnings and small craft advisories demand sailor's caution but ducks should waddle swiftly to warmth.
