Hey, time for a fascinating look at the weather! We've got a chilly vibe going on with a Cold Weather Advisory for those nights in Monterey and San Benito until Friday morning - brrr! There's no rain to speak of, just some coastal showers. Meanwhile, the wicked Tule Fog is lounging about, causing visibility mischief in some valleys. Breezy Saturday is coming their way with high-pressure snuggling into the scene—gradual warming from Friday right through the weekend. By the middle of next week, interior Central Coast might bask in the delight of the 70s! Always an exciting atmospheric play!
