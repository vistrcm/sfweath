Ah, the heavens are not quite ready to pour down upon us! We're graced with dry weather this weekend as temperatures rise heading into the work week — warmer days are just around the corner. But hold onto your hats, especially those near the coast; high surf with waves up to 25 feet may crash in, given the High Surf Advisory until Sunday morning. Marvelous, isn’t it, how the ocean keeps us on the edge!
