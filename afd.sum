Alright, weather aficionados! The dynamic upper system is pushing cooler air into our region through Saturday, but by Sunday, temperatures are set to rebound. Some patchy coastal drizzle today, and there’s a slight chance of rain across North and East Bay Friday night into Saturday – a welcome sight but don’t count on much! Чую, что скоро развергнутся хляби небесные! No thunderstorms expected, but watch out for breezy onshore winds, especially this afternoon and evening.

Stay curious and keep an eye up there – nature's always full of surprises!
