Start your day with a cold slap, akin to my first double espresso. Interior chills out in charbroiled temperatures, sundrenched afternoons. Tuesday kicks off the kitchen drama - gear up as the skies weep until Thursday. The late week suggests chunks of easy rain pulled into the simmering mix. Beware of a crusty cold weekend, interlaced with drizzle. Watch your poultry for the sneak attack from coastal floods. Stick with under 0.50" for the majority. An unpredictable but adequately saucy period ahead. Wrap up, keep dry or be ready to swim instead.
