Today find us enjoying normal temperatures, before we join the circus with a parade of cold fronts hitting us from Wednesday on. Batten down the hatches for frost potential and cracking low temps. Expect a tasting 'amuse-bouche' of rain on Friday and fierce offshore winds tearing through the Bay-Delta region on Sunday. Pass the beer, my friend - heavy weather incoming!
