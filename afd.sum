Alright crew, the weather's settled in like some well-aged whiskey: stable and smooth. Mornings will find you under a cloud and mist chaser, lifting by afternoon. Coastal areas sit pretty with highs in the 60s while inland spots bask in the balmy 70s and 80s. No downpours in sight! Prime beach weather, folks.
