The tule fog and stratus will clear this afternoon leading to a warm week, much like a June surprise in December! Beach lovers beware, though – large waves and strong rip currents are coming with the new northwesterly swell midweek. And don't shy away, a rain dance might prove to be fruitful next week. Чую, что скоро развергнутся хляби небесные next week!
