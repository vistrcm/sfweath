Listen up, people! We've got gusty winds kicking in & heating things up across SF Bay Area - admire the warm loveliness but don't disregard the risky 55+ mph gusts in North Bay mountains. 90-something temps expected inland towards the end of the week, with vulnerable populations facing a moderate heat risk. Keep hydrating and take a break in the shade. Похоже общая картина насчет погоды больше нагнетать нечего. So enjoy the wind and forget about sweaters and raincoats for now, folks.
