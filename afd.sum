Ah, my dear friends, here it goes: Marin County and its coastal followers shall dance with a bit of "water, water everywhereâ€”nor any drop to drink" kind of coastal flooding tonight! Meanwhile, enjoy the seasonal temperatures as the North Bay indulges in a sunny extravaganza today. Now prepare for stratus layers trying to break in with their misty embrace in the morning. Beware the mischievous coastal winds showing off with near-gale gusto! Good news, no thunderstorms or rain this time, mind you. But never underestimate stray drizzle hinting its nuisance before the marine layer swoops back. As weekend departs, an incoming gentle coastal breath promises to make temperatures adjust the tempo.
