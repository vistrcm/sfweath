A tantalizing cold front shall bring a speckle of rain and some chills to the Bay Area and Central Coast this morning. Lucky few might spot isolated showers, mainly hovering around the hills of Napa county. Enter Sunday, and our enjoyably nerve-racking weather experience swaps the occasional drizzle for continual toasty, dry spells â€“ ideal for adventures and gallivants in the great outdoors.
