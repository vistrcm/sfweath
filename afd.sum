Hold onto your hats in NorCal and the Central Coast! Gusty winds tickling even 50 knots could give you quite the breeze dance today, though cool below-longjohn temperatures provide little consequence. Elevated fire risks need your awareness, while the ocean sings the gale's song into the weekend with rhythmic, rough seas!
