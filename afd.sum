My goodness, talk about sizzling! A blazing sun blankets the area this weekend, with temperatures skyrocketing up to 105 degrees inland. Heat advisories everywhere and the Red Flag Warning sticking around until this morning. If you're going out, stick to the shade! Thankfully, marine layers are due next week, promising a cooler breeze. Remember, when it gets this parchedâ€”one less spark means one less disaster.
