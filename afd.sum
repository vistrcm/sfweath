Get ready for a mix of showers and thunderstorms today into Friday, reminding us that Mario, a restless disturbance, is affecting the area. Rain may bring just what the dry land needs, though with weakened instabilities, so less drama than usual for thunderstorms. However, a chance of quick downpours and gusty winds isn’t ruled out. Over the weekend, temperatures climb just enough to welcome warmth back into the picture, but more rain lurks on the horizon as we head into next week. Чую, что скоро развергнутся хляби небесные! However, coastal marine areas face strong winds and erratic gales. Keep the umbrellas ready but don’t cancel all your plans quite yet!
