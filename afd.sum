The weather in the San Francisco Bay Area will be quite the roller coaster! Today, expect cool temperatures with morning chills and some sunshine. Keep those sweaters handy—upper 30s inland and chilly winds make turning up the heat tempting. But wait! Rain is creeping in, starting tomorrow and sweeping through the area till week's end, with more widespread rain by the weekend. Чую, что скоро развергнутся хляби небесные! Watch for breezy onshore winds and light drizzle for some spooky, atmospheric charm.
