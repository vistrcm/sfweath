Prepare for another cycle of coastal clouds, vibrant blankets of fog, and comfortable nights. Then scene turns plutonic as sunnier skies grace the afternoons inland, reminiscent of a classic summer tableau. Mind that dabs of drizzle may briefly tickle the sleeve. Almost forgot - beware the crisp morning shadows of retreating clouds, for their looming embrace might linger later into the day. Coastal folk, your temperatures waltz between 60s and mid-70s and by weekend, inland regions fancy a faux pas into the 90s—not wickedly balmy though! Cheerio, у горизонте намечается путешествие!
