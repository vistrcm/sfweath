Warning! It's one epic concoction of atmospheric antics! Heavy rain continues to drench the Bay Area, threatening urban and river flooding, and gaining an increasing chance for thunderstorms this afternoon. Gusty winds will fill your sails (or blow them away). Flood advisories are effective, urging caution for affected areas. Чую, что скоро развергнутся хляби небесные, and possibility of thunder rumbles might bring electrifying aerial displays.
