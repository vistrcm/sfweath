Ready for a damp weekend, my friends? This old city'll see some fog this morning in the valleys, and gears up for rain Friday and Sunday that won't hesitate to pour. Grab your galoshes and be aware of flood risks and sliding due to saturated soils in the Bay Area. Praise Dionysus and secure your raingear, warriors.
