Alright, fellow weather enthusiasts, grab a seat! The Bay Area is in for cool days with breezy conditions, stratus clouds lingering, and some isolated drizzle. Winds might gust up to 35 mph, especially near windy spots like Altamont Pass. As the week progresses, it'll warm slightly but no heatwave lurking around the corner. Marine-layer mischief continues with hazy fog at night lifting by noon. Ah, science in the sky!
