The Bay Area must brace for a serious splashdown. Thanks to a storm force low about 1,100 miles west of Southern California, consistent rain from Sunday through Thursday is brewing in our recipe. The most tenacious instigator could stir up showers, gusty winds, possible thunderstorms on Monday, especially in North Bay. A side dish of southerly breeze and showers is expected till the end of the week.
