Alright friends, here's the rundown: we've got a subtle warming trend today before a trough vaults in this weekend. Mcuh like a splash of cold vodka, the onshore flow and marine layer are poised to cool down the warmer conditions somewhat.

Чую, что скоро развергнутся хляби небесные - expect patchy, drizzle-heavy coastal stratus Saturday night and Sunday morning. The spice in our simmering pot next week will be decided by whether the building high pressure pushes us rapidly or slowly toward true summer heat. Be aware, folks: the extreme heat - special of the day could tip the mercury into the upper 90s or even the 100s inland! But remember, the chef always leaves freshness
