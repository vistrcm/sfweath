Prepare yourself for an early spring warmth treat this weekend with sunshine filtering through hazy skies, sprinkled with some interesting beach conditions. But don't anchor yourself to those plans as a capricious front approaches. Light rain is knocking on the North Bay's doors as Sunday unfurls - Чую, что скоро развергнутся хляби небесные! Watch for sneaker waves on beaches from Sunday into Monday. Expect warming back into the week as high pressure builds up.
