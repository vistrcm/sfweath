Watch out, folks! It's rather windy in the Bay Area with gusts reaching up to 67 mph on the hills, blowing like a freight train without announcing its arrival. Take cover as these gusts continue into Wednesday, easing by the evening. Beach conditions are tricky too; waves up to 20 feet with potential sneaker waves—those sneaky devils!—run the show until Tuesday night. Stay safe and keep your distance from the wilder parts of nature.
