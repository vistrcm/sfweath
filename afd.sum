Gather 'round, friends, and bend an ear to some acid-trip chaos of a forecast ahead for San Francisco, CA this weekend. Brace for the maelstrom: strong gusty Kamikaze winds, адские ливни (Hell, it's going to rain!), potential flooding, some foolhardy trees deciding to take a nap in the street. Greatest wind and flood risks are perching on coast and high-grounds, you've been warned. Have your brollys and floaties at the ready and if you ain't Aquaman, dodge the treacherous seas. Taxi please! Prepare to kneel before the Mother Nature!
