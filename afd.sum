Ah, my curious friends of the San Francisco Bay Area and Central Coast! Today, you’ll see scattered showers fade by morning with cool, dry weather this afternoon. But strap in! Late Wednesday ushers in the next bout of delightful rain that’ll tickle the senses through Thursday. Though the waves may recede a bit on Wednesday, they’ll rally with quite some gusto right on time for the weekend, heightening our nautical adventures. Чую, что скоро развергнутся хляби небесные!
