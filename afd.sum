A curious symphony of near-normal temperatures continues while a playful dance with the clouds produces virga across North Bay and East Bay, which means rain officially doesn't meet the ground. However, fleeting showers and even the odd thunderstorm may gatecrash later today. 

Beyond a relaxed weekend forecast, waves persist persistently gentle and there's talk of a subtle warmth inviting summer's farewell into the weekend before cooling dips next week. Keep those umbrellas as exclamation props, just in case!
