Today's special: slight chance of scattered showers, served with a combo of clouds and fog. Toast the New Year in clearer conditions, but don't get too cozy. Wet, feisty weather courses back into town late Tuesday, culminating Wednesday with a tasty cocktail of rain, wind, and lower mountain snow. Expect another helping late week, confirming that winter is decidedly back on the menu.
