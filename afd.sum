It's lookin' hot and dry, folks! We're talking dangerously high temperatures with elevated fire weather concerns throughout the area. Coastal areas will see dips by the weekend, but the interior stays up to 110°F! Watch out for overnight heat, too. Чую, что скоро будет жарче, чем в аду! (Loose translation: "It's about to get hotter than Hades!")

Stay cool, hydrated, and indoors as much as possible from 10 AM to 8 PM. Avoid outdoor activities if you can, and if not, take frequent breaks and drink lots of water. And remember—never leave kids or pets in parked cars!
