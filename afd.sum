Keep your eyes peeled for dense fog this morning, especially north of the Bay - it's treacherous driving! Gusty northern winds peek in by tomorrow morning, making it breezy and heady. Coastal surf’s building sneaky waves and strong currents increase beach danger. No rain though— just wild winds and waves!
