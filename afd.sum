Think of today's Bay Area forecast like a razor-thin slice of prosciutto – bit of wind, maybe a sprinkle or two, but nothing to ring the alarms about. Expect a slight inhale of chill with temps around 60°F and the real "chef's surprise" resting in the upcoming week's unsettled pattern with rain chances prowling mostly up north. Keep that peacoat handy.
