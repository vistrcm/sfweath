All right folks, we’ve got ourselves a scorching day ahead! A Heat Advisory is up till 10 PM for a big chunk of the South Bay and Central Coast. Temps rocket to their peak today—over 100 degrees in some places. Keep cool timing down the line as a cooling trend kicks in tomorrow. By the end of the week, you’ll be looking at normal to slightly below normal temperatures.

Critical thing to note: No rain is expected, but we’ve got some dense fog in spots like Monterey this morning and strong northwest winds whipping up moderately rough sea conditions.

Stay cool, stay safe out there!
