My goodness! Well, we have strong winds swooshing through the region, along with moderate to heavy rainfall. It seems a tornadic event might have spun around in San Francisco earlier this morning. Expect gusty win, thunderstorms, and minor flooding, especially folks in the North Bayâ€”so please take care. As predicted, the torrential downpour story won't appreciate interruptions just yet: "My senses say the heavens will unfold further soon, thank you very much!" When outdoors today prepare to confront nature's mightiest shenanigans head-on!
