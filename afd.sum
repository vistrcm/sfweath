Well folks, looks like we got some seasonal temperatures for the week. There's a slight cooldown until midweek, then it's gonna get toasty. The cool maritime airmass will bring breezy winds and possible morning fog. Oh, and watch out for those small craft advisories on the water. Stay cool, it's gonna be a hot one!
