Well folks, today’s looking sizzling hot for those in North, East, South Bay and interior Monterey and San Benito – expect highs upward toward 105°F. Fire concerns hang in the air with restless winds. But watch for Tuesday, as cooler temperatures, cloud kisses, and the gentle touch of coastal drizzle join in. Not much rain, but comfort is on the horizon! Keep cool as the heat buzz dissipates.
