There are no hurricanes in the kitchen today, it's nothing but clear skies, dry with warm temps blowing into town slightly over season averages. Yet don't lose your guard, there's light rainfall brewing up north later this week with the odds increasing during the weekend. Also, beware! Fire danger sticks around due to painfully low humidities. Stay vigilant!
