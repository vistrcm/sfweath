Ah, the enchanting Bay Area! Today, after a morning dance of stratus with a future of blue skies, we'll see warm numbers climbing in the interior, while a chill hugs coastal shoulders around the 60s. Breezy whispers are building for your boating matters. And...a smidge of rain attempts a shy approach later in the week, yet dwindling hopes suggest the parade of clouds may abstain from such showersâ€”for now! Meanwhile, areas of fog are expected in the morning, with potential dense fog advisory being possible. Please rejoice safe skies and soft sunshine for the majority of the week. But remember, '*heat risk for the vulnerable!'
