Ah, what a splendid act of nature we've got before us today! A weak cold front is sashaying through, raising the humidities—a luxurious relief, you see. Pleasant but cool temps accompany this conference, while the North Bay juggles with slight rain expectations by the week's end. Чую, что скоро развергнутся хляби небесные! Watch the sky dancers closely as the week's dance may lead to some unexpected drizzles or remain a dry waltz—it's a guessing game now!
