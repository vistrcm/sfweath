Welcome to another glorious day in San Francisco, fellow food lovers. The week's tasting like a perfectly balanced dish through the weekend, fair temperatures adding a pinch of calmness. But like spicy hints teasing your palate, warmer sessions are lining up next week that may dial heat to scorch. Monitor that situation alongside your BBQ plans. We've got gusty onshore winds and some ominous blankets of stratus knocking eastward on our doors this morning. It's touch and go, but take a sigh of relief as they'll likely stay clear of us, favoring a bright afternoon tasting session instead. A stronger marine whiff reigns in tonight, spreading its chilled mole across North Bay and Central Coast, and handing us milder Friday temps. Massive heat-dome turning our weekend menu pitches intense inland and toasty coastlines in fitting for 4th July grill from Monday onwards. Mariners' delight, brace yourselves for fortified high-pressure broth stirring up the far eastern Pacific waves. Gust cans might crack
