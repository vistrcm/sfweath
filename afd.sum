Alright folks, let's break down what's cooking up in the sky today! The weather's doing its usual dance — temperatures hanging out around the normal range with some breezy onshore winds keepin' things quite pleasant. 

For today, it's mostly clear, and the thermometer’s a bit up compared to yesterday, especially near the coast and Bay shorelines. We'll keep those mists kissin' the coast at night, but nothing too dramatic since another weak trough’s nosing in.

Looking ahead, not much shake-up — temps stay moderated with gusty afternoon winds which won't cause too much in terms of fire, thanks to healthy moisture levels! Ah, don’t we just love it when nature’s got our back?

In aviation, we've got those friendly VFR conditions for most spots and breezy winds picking up in the arvo, then snuggling down by night. Monterey and KOAK terminals might deal with some stratus, but it’ll clear by late morning. Back in play tomorrow early
