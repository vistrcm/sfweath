Ah, the last day of March is serving quite a meteorological mix! Expect rain, wind gusts of up to 45 mph in higher terrains, and a slight chance of thunderstorms today into tomorrow. The deluge could drench up to an inch in the North Bay Mountains. Чую, что хляби небесные уже на подходе! But not to worry, starting Wednesday, sunshine and warmth will smile upon you by building into the weekend. Make sure not to sail without a compass or an updated weather radio, as the ocean doesn't take kindly to unprepared vessels when waves tower up to 15 feet Tuesday.
