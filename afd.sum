Expect the drizzle to hang around in the Bay Area at least until midweek. Low-to-moderate showers, even thunderstorms if luck strikes, today and heavier by early Wednesday. But hold onto your hats, we're expecting a drying cycle by the end of the week. Check your umbrellas, it seems we've just entered a gastronomy of unpredictable weather.
