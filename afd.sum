A Heat Advisory is in effect for inland areas, reaching 90s to 105 temps. Coastal areas will be cooler. Gradual cooldown starts next week. Expect fog and low stratus along the coastline. Northwesterly winds may bring gale force gusts on the waters. The high pressure system over California will result in hot and dry conditions, increasing fire danger. Cold water temperatures and rip currents pose risks for beachgoers. Stay hydrated and avoid sun exposure. Never turn your back to the ocean!
