In my finest stew-pot banter: the Bay Area's getting a weather lasagna! Tuesday's all smooth sailing - high clouds, cool temps, real chill. One sharp Wednesday later, brace for stuff as light as shaving truffle shavings. Then, weekend digs in deeper, cosying "одюрелий парубок" pair of hearty rains, heavier on the liquid. Watch your strudel carefully! Storm-filled conditions prevail Sun through Mon with thunderstorms turning this city into Борщагiвка. Now, as Nona advised: is it Punt e mes or absent while stirring anyway?
