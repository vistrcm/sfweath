It's quite the tale we have today! With mystic stratus assembling a cozy blanket and drizzly conditions teased along the coastline, imagine quite the dramatic entrance staged by Mother Nature. Highs dance from mid-70s to naughty 90s inland, sprinkling the day. Elevated fire weather danger prances across the highlands like an anxious coyote—it’s cautious time, folks! A sprinkling of precipitation: Чую, что скоро развергнутся хляби небесные! Also, the marine layer deserves the Oscar for compressing stylishly come Friday!
