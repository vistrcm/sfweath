Alright, folks, here's what you need to know:

Hold on to your hats—it's going to stay cool through mid-week with an upper level trough keeping temperatures below average. Expect highs in the 70s to low 80s inland and upper 50s to mid 60s along the coast. There's stratus up to 2500 feet and drizzle may visit the coastline early morning and night.

As we stroll into late week, temperatures will swing upwards, reaching cozy highs in the low 90s inland, possibly even the mid to upper 90s!

Now for the flyer folks, expect morning and evening low clouds strutting their stuff. Coastal and Golden Gate stratus may be a thing all day.

Marine buddies, waves are calming but watch for drizzle and slight wave upticks by mid-week. No warnings inland—take that as a free day!

Enjoy the cool spell while it lasts because things are heating up come week's end!
