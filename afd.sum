Expect a brisk and dry weekend around San Francisco, much like biting into a croissant by the Ferry Building. The Frost Advisory continues tonight, so don't let the cold sneak up on you like a line-cook with a chip on his shoulder. A chance of a midweek shower, otherwise smooth sailing,"gravlax" style, exists; main course being energetic waves of turbulence for beaches. Enjoy.
