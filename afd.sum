Cook up a day under the sun today, we're in for a treat. But buckle up, the real dish comes out Thursday - those heavenly slabs are unleashing rain upon us! Pair it with an undercut of cold winds for a White Russian kind of chill. Damn, thunderstorms might just be in the specials, adding a wintery rock-and-roll kinda vibe with possible snow showers up high. To put it according to the classics - "Чую, что скоро развергнутся хляби небесные!". Enjoy the soul-embracing chill of the latitudes, you rarely get this sort of connection between personal discomfort and shear spectacle - it's part of the whole adventure.
