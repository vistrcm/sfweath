All right folks, we've got a special in today's weather - glorious sun baked interior reaching sweaty 90s over the weekend with the teasing dance of coastal clouds skirting around, keeping things breezy. But as usual, the main course - prepare for a heat blast, straight from Hell's kitchen - set for mid-next week. And as I always say, "Stay ahead of the chef!" - don't wait for a last minute scramble, plan those heat rollover ventures now.
