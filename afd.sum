Interior Monterey and San Benito County are prepping for a culinary mishap, facing a red flag warning for dry thunderstorms with eager lightning flickering at Greenfield. Brace yourselves for isolation and low humidity. Recover from the shock and peek out, you'll find overcast conditions dense as hollandaise across KSTS/KWVI/KMRY/KSNS dissipating after 16z today. Hang tight folks, it's an atmospheric tango being played out.
