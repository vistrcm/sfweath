Cold, frosty nights are stirring through Saturday; consider the North Bay valleys for a chill-beer experience! But listen up, brace yourselves for gusty offshore winds picking up during the weekend, carving a serious slice of fire weather conditions for North Bay to Santa Cruz Mountains.  Folks, don't even think about lighting up - Fire Weather Watch is on the weekend menu. Stay safe!
