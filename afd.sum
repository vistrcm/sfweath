Brother, grab your galoshes. Sunday's looking temperamental in the Bay Area. Expect sporadic showers, particularly in Northern Bay with an appetizer of scattered morning mizzle and a chance of afternoon storms. The sky's grilling under an overcast blanket with temperatures simmering in the 60s, peaking early 70s in valleys. Ringside vista changes Sunday evening, clearing skies and moderate winds from the northwest are served up. Gusty encore performance fog on Monday's menu.
