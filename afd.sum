Great news everyone! Low temperatures with a zest of isolated showers and thunderstorming make a comeback! Even sweeter news, an inland warming trend is expected for this upcoming hump day. Struggling with folks not believing in things you'll announce? Luckily, worry no more on my pals, for there is no severe weather warnings, only mild small craft advisories. Party cloudy skies with a chance of light, spasmodic downpours, that's about it. Wine country turns green for a day, then returns with lots of sunshine. Keep it California cool everyone!
