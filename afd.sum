Cooler than average for the holiday liquor-fueled grill fest out in San Francisco. You'll beat the heat easily, but better hold on to that martini, gusts up to 40 mph are coming to snatch at spirits. No heavenly Џульницы (showers) brought forth for upcoming picnic, only a faint chance of drizzle along coast.
