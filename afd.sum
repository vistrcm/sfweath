Picture a stubborn off-shore system sassing San Francisco. Some pre-dinner rain keeping it cool today and Wednesday. Sporadic, light showers gonna pepper themselves into our weekend - mostly decorative, some might stand their ground a bit more near Sonoma. Minor coastal flooding playing tricks around SF Bay today. Just like a weather plot twist from beyond Tuesday, the night's delights, rain now on for those guys at reporter Monterey's terminals as well. Savor the cool zest amidst your dish, folks!
