Pack an umbrella, Bay Area. Light rain and cool breezes coming into play bringing the temperatures down on the patio. Friday night gets another sprinkle of rain, but hardly an event. Week looks dry afterward with temperatures warming up, time for a sunny brunch. Boaters, heads up for hazardous conditions due to gusty winds.
