Alright, folks! We're looking at a chilly start to the week in the San Francisco area, with low temperatures in the 30s Monday and Tuesday—Брр! Watch out for gusty winds up to 40 mph in the North Bay mountains on Monday, along with potential frosty conditions that might provoke a Frost Advisory. Light rain chances sneak in midweek, but Friday into the weekend seems more promising for significant rainfall. Еврика! We might be waltzing into our rainy season peak—stay curious, my friends.
