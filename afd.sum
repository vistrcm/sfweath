Ah, my dear weather enthusiasts, gather 'round for a tale of temperatures on the calm side, with a cooling trend as gentle as a lullaby expected through the week. Clouds are creeping ever so stealthily along the coast, spreading their blanket at night and leading possibly to some cozy, coastal drizzles. The skies inland, however, should soon be suntastic once the morning stratus retreats. Winds whip 'round starkly sea-wise, causing quite the ruckus for our seafaring friends. But fear not! On land, the weather remains pretty stable and rather agreeable for some weekend outdoor ventures. So, relish in the dip in temperatures and worry not, rain will wait its turn to grace us with its presence!
