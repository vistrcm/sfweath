What an intriguing forecast!

We're in for some clear skies and warming through the weekend with some light offshore winds, but watch out for those pesky sneaker waves and rip currents on the Pacific Coast beaches. The real cold will hug the nooks and crannies—we saw Santa Rosa dip to 45 degrees last night thanks to good ol' radiational cooling! Those tricky weather glasses might fog up the North Bay, so take it easy if you're driving. As for next week? Hold on to your hats, as there's a rumbling in the weather wheel, hinting perhaps at a significant Atmospheric River later—involving rain and possibly hefty winds... stay tuned!

And remember, don't ever turn your back on the ocean! Chase science, but be vigilant of Mother Nature's surreptitious wonders!
