Ah, glorious atmospheric lullabies for this weekend around San Francisco Bay! Picture breezy afternoons as Mother Nature breathes cool chuztpah from the Pacific. Unseasonably cool next week with a touch more moisture resembles the coziness we reserve for softer winter spells. Expect lows in misty companionship before retreating come daylight. Rain? Nay, dhim weather enthusiasts tell tales only of a heavy drizzle possibility.
