The weather here sits like a moody child, playing hide-and-seek with clouds and sunshine! Expect typical low clouds in the mornings with patchy coastal drizzle, shaking off to reveal inland sun by afternoon. Spot some gusty northwest breezes by Thursday, maybe even hitting 25-40 mph, but otherwise, hold on to your hats 'cause no rain in sightâ€”just patches of fog keeping it interesting!
