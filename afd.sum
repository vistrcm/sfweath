Be ready for a miscellanea of a climate: a few lethargic showers today tracing the ghost of yesterday's cold front. Then southerly winds kick up a fuss Friday, like a sous-chef with a new knifeâ€”anchoring a coming storm ready to dish out rain and scattered thunderstorms Friday into Saturday. Dry, seasonably mild weather takes charge afterwards. Get it fresh while it lasts, Amigos!
