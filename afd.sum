Quick moving system swinging through today shuffling in some rain showers, followed by a cold snap - pack your heavy jackets 'cos we're talking about frosty mornings ahead, particularly on Sunday and Monday. Midweek knocks on the door with unsettled conditions, rhythmic like a turbulent kitchen during happy hour; but without the extensive downpour - just light showers sprinkled here and there, mindful like prudent stovetop seasoning.
