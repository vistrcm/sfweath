Rain patrol's here shouting "94 наваричесь, братцы!" Gentle celestial drizzling rolling through North side this morning, later dropping by frat party at the San Fran Peninsula. Afterwards, Mama Nature's gonna set up recon with Mother Sun in mighty armor next week. 'Seas gonna be rough over there sailor'.
