Hot weather is on the horizon, with temperatures rising throughout the Bay Area and Central Coast through the weekend, especially on Thursday and Friday, reaching even higher high! This heat brings the risk of fires, so stay alert. Coastal areas will enjoy cooler temps despite the shrinking marine layer, while brisk onshore winds and rough seas threaten at sea. No rain today, so grab that sunscreen: science tells me you're in for a toasty one!
