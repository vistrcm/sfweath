Alright folks, let's dive into this! We've got a rare mid-latitude low-pressure system causing cooler temps today through Saturday, with a slight chance of light rain in the North and East Bay tonight and tomorrow—чу́ю, что скоро развергнутся хляби небесные! By Sunday through Tuesday, expect a rapid warm-up as high pressure builds in. Winds will be gentle to moderate with some afternoon breezes, and rough seas might be stirring up mid-next week. Stay curious, stay safe, and keep an umbrella handy!
