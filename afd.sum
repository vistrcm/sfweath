Ah, то чую, скоро развергнутся хляби небесные! Bounteous rain's sweeping in across the whole of San Fran. Heaven's deluge bids hello this morning, adding a dash of breezy winds to whet your appetite. After the skies sob a good one, it's a run of afternoon and evening showers that we could do without. Careful, comrades, it might fire up some surprises, а может даже безумный гримасник начнет колоть (possible thunderstorms). After our roller coaster ride winds down, we end Sunday with a few coy attempts at crying from the clouds, and a hello from Mr. Dry patch. Hold on tight to your umbrella folks, good times ahead.
