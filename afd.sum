I'll keep it short and simple for you: today and tonight we've got the same old story - cool temperatures, an inland fog party, and patchy drizzle along the coast. No surprises there. But wait, there's a slight chance of rain along the Central Coast from the remnants of Tropical Cyclone Eugene. Confidence is low though, so don't hold your breath. Expect high pressure and warmer temperatures this weekend. That's your forecast, folks. Keep it crispy out there.
