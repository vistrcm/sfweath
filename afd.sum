Well folks, grab your wide brim hats on! We've got some wild temperatures cooking things up higher, with dangerous heat bearing down. Slight relief might come next week, but steamy tricks and critical fire weather play round the clock. Keep those urns of water full and pony water on dry spells as we wade through more heat advisories and red flag warnings this week! Stay cool!
