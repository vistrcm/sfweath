The Bay Area faces intense heat with temperatures soaring into the 90s and low 100s. Heat advisories are in effect through Saturday for most inland regions, advising caution and staying hydrated. There's a shot at some patchy fog along the coast due to a redeveloping marine layer, and a tiny possibility of showers and dry lightning, though confidence in this is low. So, if you're outside, be cautious and protect yourself from the heat. The fire in Napa County continues as weather remains mild and dry. Winds, thankfully, aren't overly strong. Очевидно, буря начинается.
