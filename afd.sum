Greetings, intrepid weather lovers! Picture something out of "Groundhog Day" as the Bay Area floats on gently through mild, almost dreamlike weather. While the shores recover from the playful chaos of a recent tsunami, strapping winds are expected to make their grand entrance along the coast and through gaps Sunday and Monday thanks to a mighty trough crashing the party from the Gulf of Alaska. Good tidings for dabbling in neighborhoods of weather phenomena without situating ourselves too close to peril. Adventure onâ€”and keep an eye on those gusts and spruced-up waves!
