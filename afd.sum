Ah, there's nothing like scrawling today's daybreak forecast over our cosmic chalkboard! Heat will loom large over North, East, and South Bay counties, and parts of Monterey and San Benito until early next week. Dense fog swirls and dances about the coast like a spectral ballet. While the heat hurries diligently, beware, however, for aloof winds and dry conditions dabble in fire weather concerns. But gaze further aloft the skyâ€”by Tuesday a heavenly tweak is expected, ushering in cooler climes and a whisper of coastal drizzle to embroider the coastlines. Stay safe out there, as fervent heat makes its stage and druzy fog hangs haphazardly ahead!
